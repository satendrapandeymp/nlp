hello friends welcome to CSS video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we discussed CSS box model CSS box model says imagine every HTML element as a rectangle box which is meant to hold content content may be a text and image a PDF a video etc every box includes four important areas they are content area padding area border area and margin area there is a difference between the content width and actual width of an HTML element there is a difference between content height and actual height of an HTML element actual width of an HTML element can be calculated by using this formula content width + left padding plus a right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin actual height of an HTML element can be calculated by this equation content height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin actual width of an HTML element is the amount of space occupied by an HTML element horizontally actual height of an HTML element is the amount of space occupied by an HTML element vertically friends if we don't have padding border and a margin actual width will be equal to content width and actual height will be equal to content height if we don't have content also then the actual width will be definitely zero actual height will be definitely zero you can see here I have a HTML element box here a rectangle box to calculate the actual width what we have to do is we have to add content width + left padding + right padding + left border size right border size + left margin + right margin that gives us the actual width of an HTML element how do we calculate the actual height of a HTML element we have to add content height plus top padding plus bottom padding plus top border size plus bottom water size plus top margin plus bottom margin that gives us the actual height of HTML element that is the amount of space occupied by her HTML element vertically let's see the demonstration and get a clear idea how to calculate and align HTML elements properly one with another let me go to the notepad you can see I have already opened the default dot HTML in the notepad it has the basic HTML document structure code written title is set to CSS properties demo I have already opened default dot HTML in the chrome title ii said to CSS properties demo i go to the notepad here in the body section i am going to create a div with an ID of div 1 I say close div tag then I paste this content file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the content God displayed we know that div is a block level element it takes the entire width and it's a box of course every HTML element is a box below this div I am going to create one more div this is going to be a div with an ID of div 2 and I say here closing if this is also another div it is not going to have any width and height because we don't have any content no padding no margin nothing so everything is 0 right friends everything is 0 for the div 2 okay now what I do I go to the head section I say here style type equal to text or CSS then I say here closing style I say hash day 1 I set the background color background - color of science semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that for the div 1 we I've set the background color clearly you can see it's a box then I say here hash div 2 opening flower bracket closing flower bracket I am going to copy this background color code and paste here I say the background color for this should be magenta file save as we know that div do has no content right it has nothing inside so everything is set to 0 there is no build there is no height so we don't see any background color set there file save go to browser and refresh for the div 2 nothing is there okay no problem let's proceed and understand more now what I do here I set the width of this d12 200px same width I said to do also width of 200 px semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the div 2 width is 200 pixel and automatically you can also observe the content move down for the div do nothing is visible here you can see that there is nothing visible because we don't have any content width is 200 but the height is still 0 okay no problem here I set the height now height to 200 px the same height I am going to said to do also file save go to browser and refresh now you can be able to see D 1 as well as div 2 but you can see that the div 1 height is 200 a content is moving outside it's getting overflowed let me increase the height what I do here is I say div 1 to 20 div 2 to 20 file save go to browser and refresh that is perfect now right both the d1 and d2 are having same width and same height right both of them are having the same width and same height width is 200 height is 220 here comes the alignment of div 1 and ev2 in various ways what I do now to the div 1 add padding I say padding of 10px I'm adding 10 pixel padding we know that padding clears the area around the content right file/save go to browser and refresh now you can observe that there is a space added between the broader and the content left side we have 10 pixel top we have 10 pixel right side we have 10 pixel bottom we have 10 pixel space that is actually padding added and also you can observe there is a difference between the width of the one and div to the width of the one is more than Dave - because div - we don't have any padding to the div 1 we added padding left padding we have 10 pixel right padding we have 10 pixel so how do we calculate the actual width of the div 1 so that we can set the width of div 2 also same that is we can take help of the formula the formula says content width + left padding + right padding anyhow we don't have border and margin this complete part is zero right content width is 200 + left padding is 10 fried padding is 10 so total width is going to be 220 right here I go to the div - I say here - 20 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now again they have the same width but height is definitely different how do I prove that what I do actually is I convert the divs from block level to inline by using the CSS float property what I do here to the do one I say float left semicolon to the div - also I say float left semicolon the flow property converts the block level element to inline and it places them one beside another actually file save go to browser and refresh you can see both d1 and d2 are one beside another we're the same for both Devon and div - but height you can observe there is a difference how do I calculate the height because I want to set the do also same as the do one to do that I have to use the formula actual height of an HTML element is going to be content height plus top padding plus bottom padding of course we don't have border we don't have margin this part is going to be zero let's see the actual height of the do one is going to be the content height is 220 top padding is 10 bottom padding is 10 so - 20 + top paddington plus bottom paddington equal to 200 940 what I do now I go to the div - I change here height to 240 file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that now both of them having the same height that's good now I hope you guys are understanding clearly how we can calculate the actual width of an HTML element actual height of an HTML element and align the elements properly or lay out the elements properly right we can apply the value to float to none if I say none here in both the places in oh and a none both d1 and you are going to be block level again file save go to browser and refresh the display one below another now we have set the same width and same height good next what I do I add border I say here border of 10 pixel solid border and it is going to be red color for the sign element here file save go to browser and refresh you can see I have added a border of 10 pixel border is going to be outside the padding we know that and pixel on the left 10 pixel on the top 10 pixel on the right 10 pixel on the bottom okay now you can observe again there is a change in a width d1 width is more give to width is less how do we calculate the actual width of the do one so that we can set the width to the div two which looks same as the do one again we have to use the formula that is content width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border this is going to be zero because we don't have any margin let's calculate okay we know that 200 pixels plus left Paddington pixel plus right padding 10 pixel plus left border 10 pixel plus right border 10 pixel equal to 240 now what I do I go to the div - for this the width is going to be 240 file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that div 2 also has the same size they are looking proper now right but there will be a difference in the height again to prove that what we have to do I am going to change the float to left semicolon here also I say float left file save go to browser and refresh now they are one beside another you can observe the height of the do one is more than the div - the reason is we have border added how do we calculate the actual height of the new one we have to use the formula content height + stop padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border anyhow we don't have margin so this part is going to be 0 you can see here the do 1 content height is 220 pixels so 220 plus top padding 10 plus bottom padding 10 plus top border 10 plus bottom border 10 equal to 260 is the actual height of the do 1 so here I say 260 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that both of them are having the same height and same width both element are having the same size let me go and change this float to none I talked about the float in detail in the next video tutorial okay don't worry at present you understand that float is just we are using to convert the block level elements to inline elements so that they can be placed one beside another okay now file save go to browser and refresh again they are block level elements again the div 1 and u 2 are in rock level so they are one below another this time I add margin what I do I go to the div one I say here M argi and margin of 10 pixel semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can observe that the margin is added on the left and top 10 10 pixel right head and bottom also we have 10 pixel you can carefully observe that as we have added margin the margin has cleared the area around the border of 10 pixel and margin will be transparent anyhow as well as the padding will be transparent friends I have to align this div to also little bit right side I have to move it right what I can do is simply I can add margin so I say here am argi and margin of 10 pixel semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see the margin I have added now they are aligned properly if you want to calculate the actual width of this do one use this formula right if you want to calculate the actual height use this formula let me minimize it okay we have aligned properly no problem but also we can observe I go here and change the float property value to left flow property value to left file/save go to browser and refresh vertically also they are aligned properly that is nice right I hope you guys are understanding how we can use actual width and actual height formulas to layout HTML elements or place HTML elements properly aligned HTML elements properly according to our requirement because when we start designing web pages when we start adding border padding margin the contents are going to move here and there we can be able to adjust them properly to adjust our to design web page which is more flexible more easily editable more manageable then definitely you have to understand the calculating actual width and height of HTML elements friends I hope you guys have clearly understood CSS box model and how to calculate actual width and actual height of a HTML element and layout web page elements according to your requirement I discussed about CSS fluid property how do we float HTML element why we float HTML element what the CSS flow property does in detail in the upcoming video tutorials for this tutorial this much is enough friends I suggest you people to practice and try writing yourself some code like this for this tutorial this much is enough for more benefits and be up to date please subscribe to my youtube channel don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
