hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on the first page dot HTML I right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad in the previous tutorial we understood horizontal line or HR tag in this tutorial I am going to discuss how do we add an image to a web page file save go to browser refresh there is a tag called as IMG which is used to add images to web page let's begin IMG tag is a unpaid tag and it is an inline tag it is not a block level tag that also we should remember as it is an unpaid tag we are going to write less than IMG that is a tag name forward slash greater than symbol that's it file save go to browser refresh nothing let's proceed further first thing I have to tell to the system which image it should display we are going to use an attribute called as SRC SRC stands for source I give an equal to sign then double quotations here I should give the image name to be displayed or full path of the image and image name let's begin first here I have an image called as picture let me change this to small letter P picture dot jpg so I am going to write here VI C ture picture dot jpg file save go to browser refresh you can see that image got displayed in the browser window if I want to add one more image all I need is I am going to copy this and paste it file save go to browser and refresh you need to observe here that this next image that we have here is not going to be moved to the next line it will be displayed on the same line because IMG tag is an inline tag it won't move the content to the next line it won't take the entire width of the parent if i refresh you can see that that image also got displayed in front of the previous image if you want to move the image to the next line we can use the br tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed in the next line if I do not use a br tag both will be displayed on the same line because IMG is an inline tag now we can mention the width and height for the images if I want to increase the width of this image and height of this image I can increase by giving the width attribute maybe width I am going to give 400 and the height hig SD height I am going to give 433 file save go to browser refresh you can see that this image increase its size as this image can't be fit in this area browser has moved that image to the next line if I increase the browser size you can see that the image is on the same line so this is how you can increase the width and height of the image according to your requirement also we have few more attributes that we can use with the IMG tag IMG tag has an attribute called as title double quotation here I am going to give ma and Ju and a th manjunath she-dre I have given the image name here if I say file save go to browser refresh observe what happens when I move the mouse cursor over an image if I move the mouse cursor on this image nothing is happening if I move the mouse cursor on this image you can observe that it is displaying a small tool tip like that Manjunath Chitra is getting displayed so you can use the title attribute you can add the title attribute to IMG tag and give what you want to display when a person moves the mouse cursor over that image understanding if I have to display for this also I am going to use the title tag for that the next we have one more attribute I am gonna risk a discuss is I'm going to copy this and paste it down we know that this image won't get fit after this so the image will be displayed down here file save go to browser refresh the image God displayed here there is a one more option we have or one more attribute we have that is called as alt a LT alt R stands for alternative text so here I am going to mention ma and Ju n-ath monsoon Archie Dre now there is a difference between title and alt okay I discuss about its own file save go to browser refresh no problem if I move the mouse cursor it is showing mansion Archie Dre that is the title if I change this to just Mancha not file save go to browser refresh you will see here only much not you can see that because it is displaying the title alternative text is used when the image is not available in that place if the image is not available it let me show file save minimize and I am going to delete this image or I put it somewhere else okay maybe I put in some other folder right-click create a new folder with the name underscore images and I put that picture in this images folder as we know that the image is not in the same place of the webpage a webpage is somewhere else and the image is somewhere else so now what happens we are using in all these tags we are using picture dot jpg as the source file let's see what happens file save go to browser refresh check this out images are not displayed you can see that for these two images there is just an icon that there is no image whereas with this the third one for that this alternative text is displayed in that place Manjunath she-dre is displayed so if image is not available at that time if you want to display some text in that place the name of the image then you can display by using the alt attribute very very useful now if you want to display the image back as images in some other folder let's take the image in some other folder and you wanted to use that image what you need to do means you need to mention the path of that image I am going to use the relative path Here I am going to discuss about the path URLs and little bit future classes Here I am just going to show you how you can display an image which is in some other folder on a web page all you need is you need to mention the folder name so I am going to copy this and put in front of this control V images forward slash pictures or Debbie jpg control V forward slash control V for a slash file save go to browser refresh you can see that all images got displayed hope you guys are understanding how the image tag works how their attributes are going to work for this tutorial I think this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and
