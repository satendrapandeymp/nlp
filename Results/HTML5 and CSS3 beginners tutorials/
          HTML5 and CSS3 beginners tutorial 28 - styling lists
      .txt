hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 28 and in this tutorial I am going to talk to you guys about how to style lists on your web page okay so obviously to get started we need to have a list on our web page so I'm just going to start off by placing a header - on the web page not that we need this header but it's going to just make the list look exciting so I'm going to just type in the word menu because we are going to pretend that we're making a menu of things that a customer can choose from so let's go ahead and throw in our list and I'm just going to use an unordered list which is the UL tag and we'll throw in some list items so Li and ending Li and I'm going to duplicate that one two three times okay so we have four list items and the first list item we can go ahead and put in something our food type so let's go ahead and say bacon and cheese sandwich that actually sounds really good right about now I could use one okay and then let's go ahead and put in a hamburger as the second option and burger then the third option we can put something like a steak as you can see I've got meat on my mind so let's go ahead and put something in that's healthy and we'll just put in a salad for people that don't really want to eat meat okay so if I go ahead and I actually run this in Firefox right now then I'm just going to get a plain old unordered list nothing special about it but as you guys can see by default we have these dark fold bullet points showing up and that is pretty much what it's going to look like by default in most browsers but let's go ahead and actually change those bullet points so to do that we're going to grab our unordered list using the UL selector okay and then we're just going to pop that down a line and I'm going to select them or use the property to actually change those bullet points and the property is list style let me move my mouse type okay and list style type can be set to a number of values actually there are really a lot of values that we could set this to so by default it is set to disk and basically that is what these things are so in CSS that little black thing is or that little black dot is a disk okay and if I go ahead and I set this to circle then instead of getting a fold dot we should get an empty circle so let's click refresh and as you can see we've got this empty circle another value that I could give to this is square so Square and that will actually change this to a square just like that and this like I said quite a few different values that we could place in here and something else we could do is turn our unordered list into an ordered list by putting the value of decimal and this is actually kind of weird like the fact that you can turn an unordered list into an ordered list by just doing something as simple as that okay so as you can see even though we used an unordered list we now have numbers 1 2 3 & 4 so let's go back here and check out a few more values because instead of putting in decimal over here I could write something like lower Greek and this is actually going to give us like some Greek alphabetical letters so let's go ahead and click refresh over here and as you can see we've got I think it's alpha beta I don't really know Greek but there we go okay and we could also throw in some weird Japanese symbols as well if we used the value of katakana or katakana I don't know how you say that so if you guys know how to say that leave a comment let me know and if we click refresh you can see we have these weird Japanese symbols show up as our actual list-style-type okay but if you guys ever get bored of using one of these different values you might want to create your own image that you can use as a less style type so let's get rid of this and I'm actually going to show you guys how to use an image instead of one of those built-in values okay so to do that you're going to use this property list style image and then of course you need an actual image so I went ahead and made this image in Photoshop a little while earlier and I don't know why I did that because it just took up the entire screen and you can't really see it because it's very small okay but it is just a 40 by 40 pixel image of a green circle with a white tick okay and as you can see it is in the same folder or same directory as my index page and my CSS page so whenever I want to include that image as my list style image I just type in the word URL put in some parentheses and then actually put the image name in these parentheses so my images name is green underscore tick dot P and G and you guys are going to want to use a small image for this because if you don't the browser might not the entire image but let's click refresh and as you can see I now have these green circles with the white ticks as my actual list style image thing okay so you could go ahead and do that just be warned like I said before you if this image is going to be too big then it's probably not going to show up the entire thing might not show up and if you if you are experiencing that problem then you can go ahead and maybe just increase the line height so change the line height from whatever it is to something really big but obviously you're going to have to play around with this depending on what your image is I'm just going to make mine six hundred percent real quick and as you can see I now have a much higher or further space between all of my actual list items and before we close off the last thing I want to show you guys is just how to actually change the list style position so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of all of this real quick go back to my index page and I'm actually just going to copy this line and paste it a few times so pace pace pace pace pace pace pace pace paste and I know this is probably weird but what it did was actually make this line or this list item go over two lines and I'm just trying to show you guys that by default these little dots are actually on the outside of our lists as you can see everything on our list lines up perfectly because those dots are on the outside but if I went ahead and change the list style position and I set this to inside then we would change the position of those dots from the outside of the list to the inside of the list and look at that now we have all the dots on the inside of the list which means that anytime one of our list item just goes to a new line the actual words appear underneath the dots so that's just something if you guys wondering how to do you can go ahead and do that and the other value you could put in here is outside but by default it is already set to outside now it's about that wrong but yeah okay so that's all I have for you guys in
