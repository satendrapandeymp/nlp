in this screencast we're going to talk about setting up multiple links within one piece of image called image map image mapping allows you to set up different hotspots within a single image let's look at the image that will be working with first this image is the og solution logo section and I want to make the home about learning curve clickable and they all should click to different pages so I have two ways of doing this first by cutting this image into smaller pieces of image and piece them together using HTML this way I can sign different links to the individual pieces of the image home about learning curve the second way is to keep it as one image and use image map to set up hotspots for the home area about area and the learning curve area let's minimize these now I want to show you the required HTML code to set up an image map you first need an image tag then you set up the map within the map tag you need name because within the image tag you need to use use name with pound sign then the name of the map to associate the areas into this map or this image then within the map tag you set up area tag that defines the shape of the hotspot you can do rectangle or you can do circle or you can do polygon let's keep it to rectangle once the browser knows the shape of your area they'll need the coordinates of the the area since its rectangle the browser automatically knows that it's looking for four numbers separated by commas these would be the coordinates within the image then you need to set up the href which is the linking part you can set up the target where you want this link to open the page in you can do it to self or do not just don't do this then they'll refreshes the same page or you can do blank that opens up a new window set up some alt tag all attribute this is description of this area then you can set up multiple areas with different shapes and different coordinates different URLs just don't forget to do the use map here to associate to the map let's minimize this now if you have to go this extra step in setting up all the coordinates for your image map it really gets confusing and this is especially true if you are setting circle and polygon shapes so I'm going to use the image map editor built into this awesome free tool called GIMP 1/2 GIMP open let's open up that image now you see a lot of options here let's go to filters web image map this allows you to set up image map using just Mouse point clicks now let's do this on the left side you see three shapes rectangle circle polygons click on any one of them to set up that kind of shape within this image then once you've set set up your area the selection part will list out all the areas that you have now let's try rectangle you just move your mouse to the starting point click drag click again and you can set up your link here HTTP OGIS solution comm apply okay now the first area has been set up let's try the circle click on the circle click on the starting point and drag out it's going to expand from the center point click on it again HTTP com okay let's try the polygon so with polygon it's a little bit different you click on the starting point you move your mouse to the next area next point where you want to set your coordinates click on it and keep clicking on the different coordinates close the polygon and double click on the area now this window pops up again you can set up a different URL click OK now we have three areas with three different shapes let's save as let me resize this window so you a better view now it saves this into a dot map file name let's move to the right directory first and let's just rename this image map dot txt let's save it let's minimize everything bring back this folder you see this image map txt let's open it you see the image tag with the source to image dot jpg the width the height the border then it uses the use map attribute with a pound sign and the name of the map which is map here you can change it if you want and the map is set up like this with named map these are HTML comments that gives credit to GIMP so you can definitely leave it there you have three areas with rectangle circle and polygon and their coordinates and URLs let's move if you want to use this map just copy paste it in your HTML the right area where this image showed up and save it below the page and this should be there let's minimize this minimize this I want to show you a site where it uses image map and it's a perfect place where you should apply your image map to and the URL is here the image map I want to show you is this top header image because the links are not like this where it's all lined up it's built within the image it's harder for you to set up cut up images like this and place them using HTML so a better way of doing this is of polygon shape coordinates areas so this area will be linking to home this area will be linking to cart this is contact and this is about us now let's look at the source view page source see that the image map the image is used here image tag source with height border use map and the name of the map is here it's got alt text right after the image tag the map is set up here with name which matches the name associated inside the image tag you see the for polygon shape areas with a lot of coordinates there URLs you see the HR f H ref H ref title title you can do title 2 and alt text then you have two extra area two tags which doesn't have any coordinates or shape that's because this area is basically the rest of the area you see the rest of the area is also clickable which brings users back to the home page and that's it for this week
