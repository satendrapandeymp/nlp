in this video we're going to see how we can make an input form like this look a little bit neater in other words you see that we have a label followed by some kind of input field and the input fields are not flush so we're going for look more like this where the input fields are flush left and there's adequate spacing between the label in the field now by the way if you have a form that looks like the one I'm showing you first question yourself is do you really need all those fields but nonetheless here we are so we're going to use a little CSS trick that I remember from back when I tada and HTML and CSS class and some of the tools at our disposal are selectors so if we think about CSS CSS typically works on the series of selectors where you have some kind of selector and then an open curly and in a closed curly in between those Curly's you have the styles that you want to apply for that selector now what's a selector a selector can be a type of HTML element like an input field or maybe a button or anything that you can put on an HTML page it can also be a class we have several elements that are unrelated except for their class or it can be an ID where you are specifically calling out a specific element on a page so first of all let's take a look at the specimens HTML XHTML page that we've made and you notice that we have created some H output labels and P input texts but what does this actually resolve to when we create our page well I'm in chrome so I can hold ctrl and press U and we can find out it's a little bit jumbled I realize that but what we're going to see is that the output labels become actual label elements and the inputs the text inputs become inputs so these are two different HTML elements and thus they can be selected two different ways I'm going to add one more selector though I'm going to add a div tag and I'm going to say div class equals and then we'll say something like input data I don't want to use a terribly descriptive or a terribly generic term and that one seems to fit the bill so far so I'm going to enclose lesson clothes just our labels here and this div tag input data and then to make it visually satisfying I'm going to go ahead and tab it that won't have any material change so far on our page if I go back and refresh we're going to see the same page but what it does do is it gives us an additional selector because I can say class equals input data as a matter of fact you know I don't vote no I already did that didn't I okay the class is the selector we're going to use in CSS okay so now we have a total of three selectors that we can use we have the input data div tag but divits just a grouping we have label and we have input so these are three selectors we can use so let's remember how this page is made this is the this is the JSF source of our input page like so the JSF source here and we see that it is tied together with the UI composition tag to something called template XHTML if we look at template XHTML we see that it's pulling in the style sheet called style.css so I'm going to go to style CSS okay now how do I make a selector just for that div tag well since it's a class I use a period and I'll say input data okay and at this point I could do something like a background color just so we can verify let's just try it out real quick here and we'll verify that I have my selector correct and I'm going to choose save and then I'm going to go back and I'm going to choose reload and you see that we do have our selector correct because it's now putting a kind of that brownish rattan background behind for now that we can take away we're just looking at our selector okay next step we actually want to make a more complicated selector we can have a more specific selector by saying okay input data but within input data I only want to apply something to input HTML input elements okay and what am I going to supply to that well I might give it a margin left so I might say okay margin left and then we'll say 90 M where am is kind of like just a relative element and that's good enough so far so let me save and I'm going to go back and refresh and let's see what we get now you see that the these labels are now that's a length of 90 M that you see so you see we have a bit of additional spacing but there's still not flush and to handle that we have to do a bit more trickery in CSS now the trick that we have to do is we have to tell the input boxes to not make their distance from the left relative to the label instead we have to say make your distance from the left relative to the very left not including the label in other words we have to take the label out of the equation so what we're going to do then is we're going to make a selector just for that label we're going to say dot input data label whoops remember what that selector is again input data is the class for our div tag label is the HTML element that could be any HTML element so label input submit button anything that we can put on HTML is an HTML tag can be a label the nice thing by the way about this input is think about everything that's an input input type equals text input type equals password any of those inputs that's going to apply to any of those which is why I used a very generic selector up above that just says input anyway I digress so for label what we want to do is we want to say take this out of the calculation for positioning for everything else in this class called input data and we're going to say position absolute and then we're going to save now let's go back and refresh refresh and take a look now all of the text boxes are 90 M from fresh flush left not including the label and notice that they're they're equally spaced and no matter how long the label is the input boxes out there hopefully we've left enough space if we end up with a really long label we might want to ask ourselves do we need a label that long remember concise is key when we're thinking about web design so we want to say as much as we can in as few words as we can but if we do have a label that goes on forever maybe for a legal requirement or something like that then we'll just bump these out maybe to 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. or whatever is going to give it real but as it is now we have this position nicely so the form looks nice and neat so the sequence here we're a div tag with the input data class and a dot selector which is going to select based on that glass the input selector for an input field and then the label selector for the label very important make sure that you're using the H output label tag and JSF to create those labels and the P input text to create the text fields if you're not using JSF if you're using just normal HTML then a very similar concept what we're going to do is we're going to say label first name close label and then input type equals text name equals first name and with that we're going to get the exact same behavior that I got here using JSF all right I hope that video was helpful thank you
