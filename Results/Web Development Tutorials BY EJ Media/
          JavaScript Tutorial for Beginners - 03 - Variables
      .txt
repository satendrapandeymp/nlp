today we're going to look at variables and variables are what we're going to be using throughout this series so it's a good time to take an initial look at them now when you define a variable in JavaScript you always define it with var right here var because if you don't you don't have a variable so that's pretty easy to remember and that's a little bit different than Java where you will remember if you took my series on Java you had to define datatypes that kind of stuff nope here all you need is var now there are two ways to start off of the variable one is you can declare it like we did here we called it de but we did not assign it a value you can assign a value to it later so here we just gave it a name but we didn't use the equal sign so we didn't give it a value the second way is to declare it and then we give it our name right here we declared it gave it a name called assigned value so that's the name of our variable and then we assigned a value to it which is a numeric value this long number right here now similar to Java you have comments which you can put in here and if you use two slashes what happens is the browser will actually ignore these and continue on to the next line of code that it finds so so this green here denotes that it's a comment and it will not be executed in the browser now there are three primary types of variables in JavaScript and we will be using all of these in later tutorials there are numeric variables and that's pretty simple we just put in a number right here very easy to remember there are string variables where we put in some text or characters and then the third type is just a simple true or false those are boolean variables and those are very easy to remember so just three types of variables there are some other flavors but these are the three primary ones we'll be using throughout this series so once again you declare it with var you give it a name and then you assign it a value and of course this equal sign here gives it a value so you must have that that assigns the value to our variable name and you'll see this function here we're actually going to put in we're actually going to type this in a minute and I'll talk about functions in a few minutes now why do we use variables think of it as storage this is the way the computer remember something it's his memory without it the computer program wouldn't be able to remember things so basically it allows the computer to remember and it allows them to use variables later on now you can only start variables with a letter or an underscore so I can't put like a one two three in here no you can't do that you have to start it out with a letter or a and you see when I tried to do that the actual variable name turned red which was telling me which no bed plus plus is telling me a you can't do that now another rule in terms of naming convention you don't have to necessarily follow this but you probably should is that when you start a new word you should always capitalized it so in this case and the first word should not be capitalized so in this case I had a sign so the a is in lowercase and then the second word which was value I started out with a capital V now if the naming convention is just one word we use all lowercase and variables are case sensitive you also like in almost every programming language so I will show you that in a minute now we're going to do a tutorial on functions later around but every program needs a function and functions are very similar to methods in Java so if you took my series on Java functions are very very similar and what they do is they act upon the variables that we used up here because without functions these variables really wouldn't serve any purpose so think of a function like an action or behavior this is where we're going to work against our variables and so let's put a function in here so we can go ahead and use this program now this is called the alert function and this is something we're going to be using a lot in these early tutorials now later on I'll be introducing you to new JavaScript functions but the alert function is something we're going to use early on so we just type in alert and we're going to type in open paren and this is we're going to use some of the variables that we defined up here and we're going to use years and some text we are not going to use game over or these two variables right here now we can define all the variables we want we don't have to use them right away we could always use them later so we're just going to use these two variables for now so we're going to type in years and you notice how the intellisense for notepad actually found the variable so we can just go ahead and select that and then we're going to use a math operator we'll talk about math later on and then we're going to add that to the some text and you can see how it found it right there so we can just select that and then we use a closing parenthesis now I want to show you the case sensitivity part here put in T this is referring to some other variable that we didn't even define here so we have to match the case exactly and there you go and then we use a semicolon to end this statement remember everything's a statement so that's what we're doing we're using the alert function which is this and we're adding our two variables now this alert function actually is pretty useful you can actually send a message to the user so again this is a JavaScript function that's supplied by JavaScript that we're using here so if this works out we should get a message that will say 35 Plus this years old right so it'll sum these up and it should just say 35 years old so let's go up to run and we're actually going to launch this in chrome and there you can see we got our JavaScript alert and it says 35 years old okay that is going to do it for this tutorial I will see you guys in the next tutorial
