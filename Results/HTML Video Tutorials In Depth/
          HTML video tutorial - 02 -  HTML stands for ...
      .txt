no friends welcome to HTML tutorial seen the previous tutorial we understood what is the website why we need a website we understood body of webpage we understood who has developed HTML and what happen in HTML we also understood what HTML stands for and we understood that hTML is a word from HTML and as we know that hTML is a markup language what a markup language country Oh in this tutorial we get some more information on HTML you can see that I have another slide here I'm using image Spain you can see that let's understand both on HTML let's get some more information on it German here HTML stands for we already knew that the ML stands for hypertext markup language now what if I put what it takes what do you mass of what is language is markup language let's understand one thing for here now very clear in HTML page we are going to understand that how to create an HTML page and on the next table here what I want would like to talk is I would like to tell you about what actually our web page or a experiment trpm8 document or a web page document or web document is going to contain insightly like when you open other page or a web document or a HTML page or a HTML document what you see inside it that's what we are going T so X table pages or web pages or web documents contain when they contain this until I first take so usually you will see I protect or also net economy I protect also known as hyperlinks now what are those for me there - link allows us to navigate on this daily usually then you open some web pages you see something like this it takes which is underlined and colored in a blue so if you click on that texture if we navigate you to some other page or if you click on that page you might navigate to some other section in the same things now such things are known as hyperlinks or hypertext Chinese then what a web page is to contain the web pages or web documents how to rule to contain the actual content that you would like to display or the actual information or a content that you want to play under the Train six as I told them if I have a company I want to save some information world with that information I am going to put on the referee so that means we takes all the actual content the next if you are also going to see some Martha let's understand what hot Martha the marks of reference to that HTML as I told that hTML is a markup language so mass of language we already know that what is the mark up language markup languages are going to contain set of tags or I can say a tag based language which is understood by the browser browsers are going to use those tags to control the format of your page so here as I told a lot of reference to tags are control information to format the content of the web page if you want to format the content of the web page you will be using the text or I can name Martha some HTML tags and use the pirate web browser they are used by web browsers to format the content of a page so browsers are going to use these tags to format your content on the web page so browsers do not display the HTML tag that you remember yes this is a point one of the important point is remember he browses do not display HTML tag under the page but they are used by the browser super cool before that of the content on the web page then what are browsers no browsers are clients office or the factories that are installed on your machine for interpreting and displaying the html5 so browsers are those of this interpreter HTML pages and display them on problems for example we have internet explorer firefox these are all browsers example now as i told that one of our tags there are two different types of tags that you see there the tags and your goal - unfair attacks now pay attacks are 2/3 which are going to curtail will keep opening and closing - that means say that have their companion tags opening tags or stopping - and closing or endanger take an example here I have some text that is one I want to display that on the web page with a promise well maybe is people heading for a paragraph then what I do before this says this is the actual information of the text yes and I am going to write the put that a opening or starting it were dead and after that I am going to write a closing for ending exponent here texts are going to be written in between the angle brackets or you can say that the tags are sandwiched between the opening angle bracket and a closing angle so here you see that I have a catch one death how do you write a opening head contacts the opening intimate as you write something like this right we let the symbol or the opening angle bracket you have you then you need to write the name of the death there are many tanks we have experiment we have each one - font as we are - we can there are many accesses so here I have written to get one then me then I have to write the closing angle bracket okay this indicates we opening h1 tag now how do you rate it closing is 110 closing it one tag you can write something like this you have greater less than symbol then you should write is /the power slash in details that you want throw in attack and the Jennifer Brice here which that you want to close here I am doing closing bh1 - do I ever done Eckman then I am going to write the greater than symbol now this tag is excluding that for headphones I hope you guys are understand now you are controlling the format of this thing now this set is going to be displayed as a heading okay how it widget is played we are going to see what will be the output of this pod we will see that in the next term here I would like to tell you that what are tags how they will be written and irwadi a opening tag what each is rolled in time how do you identify something is a opening how do you identify something is a closing tag and also I got the to introduce in here that how do you write a opening tag how do you write a closing tag and as I told that on the browser you will see getting one but you will not see these tax that's what here I have told that browsers do not display the HTML tag on the browser window yep next here you can see I am giving you one more example let me remove it if you see here I have another text return here I am stylized with it now this thing I want to display little bit stylized maybe I want to apply some color to that either display this text in a larger size and I want to apply some different font to it then we are going to use the tag called as constant and you can see that font tag is also updated at the bail tag means if you have an opening as your content should have a closed in there so tell to the system that where you are starting and where you are ending stylization so here you can see that I have again less than different then I have name of the font name of the tag that is a font tag here and then I have a closing bracket closing angle bracket so that is the opening content then I have some text that is the actual information that I want to display on the browser then I have a fluid content now here I have a ton the less than symbol then I have a forward slash to indicate that I am closing the tag which tag am closing I am closing the content so I have written here name of the tag that is form then I have a greater than symbol to indicate that this is a closed set and whatever I have a done to you between that is equal to this I light based on the tag that you are using now here sometimes the tags can also have a DB now water attitude so attribute you have to write just before the greater than symbol and after the name of the tag so here I am going to write two attributes of the content I give a space then I will start writing the address so attributes are its first settings we can take our extra properties of the tags that are helpful to give some stylization or it'll save you more information to the browser what to do here I want to say that this text the text that I have here I have kept inside the contact and I want to apply its color also so if I say color equal to equal to red our position here what I have done means I have added one attribute with the name as color there is an attribute called as color and to the attribute we can assign a value how do you assign a value you have to use the equal to sign then you should give any value that suits are suitable for that attitude we understand different values for different attitude in an upcoming tutorial so whenever you want to give a value you should write that value in double quotation time so here I have written red red is the value that I have put in double citations and I am assigning assigning that to the color attribute now what happens means the browser will display this step I am stylized text with the color red by default if you do not have this value even to the energy if you write like this then you will get I am stylized text displayed on the browser but it will be in black fellow if I add color equal to red potential then you will see this I am this takes in the renderer then if I you might have more attributes also you can give more attitude to add more attitude in a tag so here if I give a space and I can give more attribute like size equal to 7 you can see that I have added one more attribute by giving a space after the value of the first attitude I have given a space then I have returned the next attribute of the contact here that is inside and then I have I have assigned a value to e7 and you can see that say one I have returned in double sedation our condition and this time what happens me I am stylized things we get this place in a larger size differently like the seven points is actually different points sighs yes this X period is placed with seven then as I told that tax will be of two types pays that so clear - we'll be having the opening tag and the closing - so tell me where to start where to end there are few tags which you will find in HTML those are also known as unpaid tag or singular tag or tan alone - now singular or a standalone tag I am going to be written something like this they are not fair they are unpaid that means your Google have both opening as well as slowly opening as well as closing tag in one character so here we can see that how do we write an advantage for for example VR is unfair that HR is the unfair - here we can see that for VR VR is used for breaking line or an oolong you can see here I have a less than symbol then I have name of the tag written that is VR then we are going to write forward slash then we write the greater than symbol this indicates that this we a both me as well as a closing there and one more example if I have to show you let me remove this here I have a HR dad you can see which is an unfair or a standard on tag here which have we have less than symbol then we have a name of the tag HR then followed that then the traitor then prefer this means the tag if you cook this tag in your HTML page it will add a horizontal none HR stands for horizontal line so to add the horizontal line we use this that now when you add this to it see you will see a horizontal line in a black color now you want each color to be applied to the horizontal line I want a horizontal line is a ridiculous then I am going to add one as we do how do we add an attribute I am going to write here just before the craters are forward slash just before the forward slash and after the name of the - give us page the agency that I am gonna feel then I will add an attribute called as brother and I assign a value to it and then then what happens now me you will get a horizontal line but that line will be colored as red so this is how you can add the attribute you can add more attributes you know how to add the attribute if I want one for every type in table space here and identity with size attribute this is an attribute of the horizontal line and I assign a value to it maybe three so here I have given site equal to 3 and this attitude will make your horizontal line thickness to 3 P so that that is the meaning of for pay attacks and unfair attacks how you will write the players attacks and how you will write on there - yeah that is all about the resistible what you clean is statements so in this tutorial we have understood what X table stands for I protects markup language what you feel in HTML pages you will find hypertext that is hyperlinks which allows you to navigate from one place to another place or jump one page to another page I mean navigation or navigate or jump the meaning of hyper we navigate awesome then you will find the actual information that you would like to display like I want display I am highlighted I want to display heading 1 that is the actual information that you will find when you have a pager and also you are going to find Martha that are taxed and taxed as that they are controlling permissions for the browser so that you use the tag 10 to the browser how do you display how do you want to display some text like I want to display some text color that I wanted to play something with outside 7 these are the control information and tags are not going to be displayed by a browser they are just going to be used by the browser to display in different formats and routers are cockpit they are going to interpret your HTML pages and display them and there are two types of tags we have a tag and unveil text so they attack salvos will have an opening tag and a closing tag whereas unfair tags are going to have full in one place opening as well as closed so for this tutorial I think this much is enough friend what is video again and again and again kinda understand clearly what I would what I want to explain here in the next tutorial we understand a move get more information if you have any conclusions those conclusions are going to be clear step-by-step you get a better information on HTML hope you guys have understood so for this tutorial this much is enough friends thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding shipshape
