using a color picker could be helpful and sometimes it's all we need but for precision we often want to get more specific and there are three common ways that colors are represented on the web we have color names hex codes or hex triplets and RGB a let's start with names these are the common color names for 140 colors that are supported by modern browsers for instance sometimes we see one e90 FF which might be more challenging to remember than Dodger blue so if we type in Dodger blue we're all set but the names and the colors are somewhat arbitrary like lawn green peach puff blanched almond and of course lemon chiffon because these presets because HTML color names are in a full representation of what's entirely possible with web colors sometimes it can be a bit more freeing to use one of the other formats with that being said we have hex codes and these are usually six digit codes that correspond with a precise color output and the reason they're also called hex triplets is because there are three sets of two digits red green and blue the same three colors that make up each pixel in a display as you increase the value of a particular color the more of that color you get in your output set all values to zero we got black ramped up the red we got red and if we add blue we approach magenta add in some green now we have full white you can play with the red and the green and the blue to get virtually any color you can think of the hex part of this is pretty simple if you're a fan of counting in traditional counting base ten we count zero through nine in the ones place then we switched the tens place to a one counting zero through nine again we repeat each time we pass nine when we count hexadecimal E which is not a real word we just add the letters A through F after our 9s that's it before we switch to ten we're going to do ABCDE F then we switch the digit to the left after we count past F we're just adding hof after our nines same thing in the tens place when our numbers get large enough sometimes designers and developers will use shorthand hex on google the background attribute is FFF and the color attribute which affects text color is two to two you can use shorthand hex if you're working with a color that has repeating digits in all three of the color values like a a B BCC or four for one one ie you can simply omit the second digit for each color making it ABC or for one e now it's hexadecimals aren't your thing you don't need them in fact if you prefer to think numerically you're in luck because our GBA uses good old-fashioned base-10 normal numbers what's after nine ten what's after 99 100 what's after six RGBA uses the values 0 through 255 to represent each color that's 256 levels of red if we include 0 same control here as hex red green blue and in this case the a of course is for alpha this is incredible freedom right here when we're setting colors so we can control the opacity from completely transparent to fully opaque the lower the alpha the more transparent the color the higher the alpha the more opaque so we have color names for some of our more specific colors like chocolate and Burley would we have hex codes or hex triplets which let us specify red green and blue values hexadecimal e and RGB a numerical control over each color and the ability to adjust opacity
