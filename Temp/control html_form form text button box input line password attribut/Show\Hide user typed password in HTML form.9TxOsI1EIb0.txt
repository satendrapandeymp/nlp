hello guys welcome to a brand new video in this video I will be doing a very small thing you know as you might have seen in many way pages there is small button next to our password field which when clicked will so that password and we will achieve that there good effect using javascript and nothing else you don't need to worry or anything it's really simple with JavaScript so let's get started the first thing I want to do is create a new folder here and let's name it so password now next thing I want to do is open this folder with visual studio code so if you have good passage what you can do is type code dot which means this folder and you will get your visual studio code open in this particular folder first of all let us create a new HTML file let's open up with live server okay next thing I want to do is link a few things let's add some style I will add style dot CSS file here which I have not created yet and at the end of our body tag let's include our script okay let's create these two files you the first thing I want to do is get an input field and let's give it an idea pass okay the next thing I wanna do is create a button and initially this button will say so password the idea is that user will type some password and here we go there is one small thing that I have left out you have to see and state the type this what will give us a little type you have to make sure that this is password type of password so when you type password the idea is that when user click this button this bullet point will turn into actual world a user had typed and will toggle that button so that either will either see or hide that password so that's the idea here let's go to our script file and start writing our JavaScript I'll be using javascript not jQuery and nothing like that it will be view of JavaScript okay so fasting first list we have to listen to the users button click so we have to make sure that we captures this event when user clicks this button we need to make things happen so let's grab that button to do that let's declare a few things here let's get that button and this button would be sorry document dot you can use get element by ID I will just use query selector and our ID was median so that's it no next thing I wanna graph is the actual password user has typed or no type but the password field we can also grab what you user says users has typed but for now let's grab that field only and we have given it an ID of pass okay the next thing is we have to add an event listener because when user clicks on this button an event happens in our application and we have to cast that and react to that event so in our button we made it's great we will add an event listener here and the event we are listening to is clicked and we will do something here and I will just pass in a function anonymous function here let's do something okay so the first thing that I want to do is check the type and before that let's see if everything is working correctly and to do that let's just check that we get some kind of alert once I click on that button so pass okay let's say kit and we've got our alert so so far so good it's working the thing that I am trying to do here is whenever users click this button I want to change the type from password to text so when type is text you will be actually able to see what the users hands type but when the type is password you will see that bullet point okay and that's it and that's it time it's as easy as that so let's check if the type is text and if it is text we will do something and if it is type of password we will do another thing so we have grabbed this field okay we have grabbed this field into this variable the path variable so if the type of this password is text that means we have already clipped it and changed its type to text so in that case what we will do is that we will change the type to password okay and next thing I wanna do is change the text of that button so button dot let's say in arresting Emma sorry no hTML is equal to so password okay let me explain what's going on here we will check if the type the attribute of this type is text its text then we will change the type to password and we'll make sure that the button text C is so password okay because - so password what we will do is change the type to text or to password and if that's not the case then we will do something else that means the type is password so we will change the type to text okay we'll change the type to text and we'll change button text and we will change in a rest AML to hide password okay that's distance I think this will be int now I have typed the password you can see that password when I click that button you can see that the password has now changed and the Greek was triggered and it changed the type to text in this case the its else Clause was triggered okay so it changed the text and sorry in the type HTML attribute of type to text and you can see that the pattern text has also changed now when I click this button again at this point this if Clause is triggered because input type what change to text from here so this was triggered and we change the type to puzzled and since the button takes two so password and this is it it's not actually that complicated that's it that's the whole JavaScript you ever need but at this point I think I will do some styling to our input field and button and make it a bit prettier okay so let's go to style let's do some styling the first style is let's style that input field you okay so I think that's it now when you change your focus to that infiltrate this style remains the same so let's just change that you once you are into focus the whole thing changes into a more darker color and so that's it the next i'll i wanna do is i wanna style the button so password highly password button you I think I'm done with this style here but instead of this text let's grab some font awesome icon and use that let's go to font awesome site and let's go to maybe how to use section let's copy this CDN link this to your Syrian link here now it's time to search for actual icons so let's go to icons and okay I think I will start three icons only and let's once what I or something like that I think I will use one of these funds and maybe this one maybe this one and this one the father and the first and the third one okay to use this icon and just go to that icon and you get a small icon code here and it says copy this code come to our code and instead of so password let's face that icon here let's save it and that's it you get your little icon here okay this is 4 so password and for high password you have to go to you can see that the initial loading icon is loading enough of that this boot changes are happening from JavaScript so we have to make sure that we change our code in JavaScript as well so let's go to our script and in in place of so password let's delete everything here and in single quote paste that font awesome icon here okay so that's it let's see what's the code for hide password I think it's this one and let's copy this a little code here let's go to our script and in case of hide password just delete it just your HTML here and see if let's test it okay guys this is it I think we are done for this little mini project here bye bye don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and have a nice day
