we're going to take a break from the grid for a little bit and we're gonna take a look at topography in bootstrap now one of the things that bootstrap does very nicely it will automatically select fonts and font sizes for you depending on the device type that is being used to browse your web page so that is very nice so this is the default format that bootstrap uses and in this case this is for the Chrome browser and you can see here it looks like we've got helvetica fonts and it does a very nice job now I have the same exact page without bootstrap and I want you to take a look at the difference take a look at that that doesn't look nearly as nice does it it's using the old New Times Roman and so as you can see bootstrap automatically does a lot of the work for you in terms of the fonts and the sizes of the fonts and you can see here the h1 heading is automatically in bold and bootstrap uses the font size of 36 pixels for the h1 heading for the h2 the default is 30 pixels and for the h3 the default is 24 pixels now even though bootstrap handles a lot of the typography for you there are some things you'll want to know so let's go ahead and close this out and let's take a look at some of the things you can do with typography in bootstrap now one of the nice things that bootstrap allows you to do is to create a sub heading off your main heading and you use that with the small text so let's go ahead and do that and I'll just copy and paste it right here because I already have it in my clipboard so there you can see we use the small tag and we close it out with the small tag and this will create a nice little subheading so let's go ahead and save this and let's open this up in chrome and see what we get and there you can see look we have this nice little subheading now that you can use and you can see the text is a little bit lighter and it's a little bit smaller now you can also hide headings if you need to so let's go ahead and hide it heading so let's go here and we'll just copy and paste this and let's just call this h3 hide heading so what we do is we go here and we're gonna call another bootstrap class and as you've seen throughout this series a lot of this is just calling the correct bootstrap class that you want to use and in this case we want to use the text hide class all right so now hopefully this will be hidden so let's go ahead and save this let's go ahead and run this and there you can see it's now hid now you'll notice that the space is still there but the heading itself has disappeared so that's how the text hide class works now what if you wanted your text to really stand out you can do that with the lead class so let's go ahead and we'll create a class here and again you call the lead class so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get and there you can see this is all in bold now and the size of the font is also increased now you can also use this span element with the lead class so let's say we wanted to make these first three words here stand out we can use the span element again with the lead class so let's go ahead and do that so as you probably know by now we use these fan tech and then we can just go up here and copy and paste the lead class and we'll just copy and paste it right down here and then we'll go ahead and close this out and we said we would span these first three words here so let's go ahead and close out the span and let's save this and let's see what we get there you can see now the first three words in the second paragraph stand out so that's quite useful as well now by default of course the text and paragraphs aligns to the left but you can switch that up using bootstrap so let's say we want all the text in this to align to the center you can use that with the text center class so let's go ahead and do that and we just use the text Center class again so let's go ahead and see what happens here and there you can see all the text now is aligned to the center so just a little bit different way you can do things now you also can turn off word wrapping using bootstrap as well so let's say you didn't want the sentence here to wrap you just wanted to continue on going its merry way you can use a bootstrap class for that as well and the class we use is text - no rap so let's go ahead and see what this looks like there you can see the sentence is no longer rap so this will just continue going as far as it needs to so that's what the text no rap class does now in this paragraph of course we centered the text but you can also align it to the right so let's go ahead and do that and we can just take this class right here and we'll just copy and paste this right down here and instead of text - Center we're gonna use text - right and let's see what we get there you can see the text is now aligned to the right now I have some other classes to show you but you know what let's just work against this final paragraph now you can also capitalize all of the text in your paragraph if you want to and for that we use the text capitalized class so let's see what we get here there you can see all the text is now capitalized in terms of the first letter of each word now you can also make all of the characters uppercase and let's go ahead and see what we get and now you can see all the characters are in uppercase and you can make everything lowercase as well so let's go ahead and do that and now everything is in lowercase now I have one more thing to show you you can actually quickly decrease the size of the text if you want using the small class so let me show you that really quickly and there you can see the text is now smaller okay I know I packed a lot of information in there but I hope you found this useful thanks as always for watching
