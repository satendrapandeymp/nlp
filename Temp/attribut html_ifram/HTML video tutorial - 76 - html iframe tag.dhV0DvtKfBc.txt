hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we have understood HTML frame set and HTML frame tag we know that normally browsers display only one web page at a time to display more than one web pages in the browser window we use HTML frame set and HTML frame tag to use frame set tag we need to omit body tag and that actually breaks the structure of a typical HTML document as we know that small screen devices don't support and render frame sets in a proper way hence frame set tag is a deprecated or outdated it is recommended not to use frame sets while designing websites there is an alternative tag which we use known as iframe tag in this tutorial we are going to discuss about HTML iframe tag iframe stands for inline frame it is quite similar to the frame tag it is used to display a local web page as well as a remote web page local web page means a web page available in the current website and remote web page means a web page available in another website to use iframe tag we need not to omit the body tag we can use iframe tag inside the body tag itself let's see the example I go to start then I say notepad and I write the typical HTML structure closing HTML opening head and closing head opening body and closing body tag in the head tag I am going to put title iframe tag demo closing title file save as this is going to be default dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and save that at desktop you can see that default dot HTML page got created I can right click open with the Firefox this is how it see iframe tag demo is set as a title file say core browser and refresh iframe tag demo now in the body tag we can use iframe tag so iframe tag I'm writing opening iframe tag and Here I am going to write closing iframe tag in between the iframe tag I use one paragraph to say that if browser do not support I want to give a message to user that your browser don't support the iframe tag so I can write here you were browser BR o w SE r browser don't support iframe check closing paragraph or I can say here instead of your browser here I say this browser don't support iframe tag file save and go to browser and refresh you can see that it has given a frame in the body tag in this frame we can display a webpage in the current website or we can display a web page which is available in another website you can create more iframe tags I can copy this iframe and paste it down one more time file save go to browser and refresh you can see that one more inline frame got created we can display different web pages in these frames if we want quite simple first of all I am going to create one more web page I am going to remove all this content here I write frame one content something like that the title I am going to set frame one and I save file save as frame 1 dot HTML both sides I put double quotations I save it at desktop and then this is going to be frame to content and I save file save as frame two dot HTML put double quotations on both sides and save it desktop I close this and now I open this with the notepad here we have a previous code iframe tag has one attribute called as SRC it takes an absolute path or a relative path here you can give a web page which is on the local machine or a web page available on different website at present I say here frame 1 dot HTML you can see here I told that in this iframe I want to load frame 1 dot HTML page file save right click open with the Firefox you can see that it is showing here frame 1 content where we have this content it is in the frame 1 dot HTML page and here in this frame I am going to say SRC frame 2 dot HTML page I want to display file save right click open with the Firefox you can see that in this frame I am seeing frame 2 content let me show you that let me right click on the frame 1 open with the notepad and I set the BG color to this BG color to maybe sign I save file save and now I open the default dot HTML page open with the Firefox you can see that frame 1 content you can see that this page has a background color sign and this is white because we have not set any background color do open with D notepad and here I can say BG see vuelvo are color to magenta file save close this right click open with the Firefox you can see that frame 2 dot HTML is displayed in the iframe 2 here and it is also showing the frame 2 content and the background you can see set imaginethe very useful right if you want to show you can show some other webpage from some other website also for example if I want to show the Google website here all I need is I need to write here HTTP colon double forward slash www.google.com dot in if I type like this okay as I am not connected to the Internet let me say file save go to browser and refresh let me open once again right click open with the Firefox you can see that it is telling server not found as I am not connected to the Internet it is telling server not found this web page is displayed okay if I am connected to the Internet here you will see the Google homepage so you can write the complete URL or URI in this place hope you guys have understood so here frame 1 dot html' at present file save right click open with the firefox so frame 1 dot HTML and frame 2 dot HTML are on the local machine so I don't have any problem here you can see that you can see you are displaying more than one web pages and following the typical structure of the HTML document you are not breaking that and there are a few more attributes we have like a name attribute you can use and you can say here frame 1 and here you can say name attribute name is equal to frame 2 and we know that the name attribute is very very useful with respect to the anchor tag because in the anchor tag we know that we can mention the target frame name we can open some web pages on clicking on a hyperlink in a specific iframe ok for example I can create one anchor tag here anchor href hyperlink reference and I say here frame two dot HTML page should get open in a target frame and that is fr AME frame 1 for example it should get open in the frame 1 I just right here click me and close anchor tag check out what happens if I save file save minimize right click open with the Firefox so here I have the click me option if I click on this it opens the frame 2 dot HTML in the frame 1 that is here we have the frame 1 right let me show that if I click on click me you can see that frame 2 content is displayed right frame 2 dot HTML body content is now displayed so that is the use of the name attribute hope you guys are understanding if I say frame 1 dot HTML get should get display in frame 2 and save file save minimize close right click on default dot HTML open with the Firefox and click on click me this time you can see that in the iframe - I am saying frame 1 dot HTML content so quite useful hope you guys have understood what is the use of the name attribute with respect to the anchor tag over here that is the name attribute we also have few more attributes which are very useful with respect to the iframe tag that is frame border fr am a frame Bevo rder frame border you can mention 1 indicates frame border should be whereas zero indicates frameborder need not be present so let's see what happens file save go browser and refresh you can see that this frame are iframe two has no border whereas iframe one has the border very useful let's see more attributes I am going to put here name frame border similarly here name for the second iframe I have frame bar zero and if you have more content normally what you find is a scroll bar also you will find at present you can see only border we are seeing let's see scrolling option what I do means I put some content in frame one rightly do open with the notepad and here I am going to say some break tags okay and I copy this and paste it few times so I copy this content and frail paste it few times here paste at few times few times few times I say file save and close this time I open the default dot HTML open with the Firefox and you can see that it is showing the scroll bar to scroll the content as the content is exceeding the height you can see that I can scroll around if I want to stop scrolling there should not be a scrollbar then we can use the scrolling attribute SC arwe l li ng scrolling scrolling is equal to you can mention here again yes or no attributes if you say no and say file save your browser and refresh you can see that the scrollbar is removed and I cannot scroll the content so that is the useful attribute with respect to iframe to control whether the scrolling or a scrollbar should be visible or not whether the user can be able to scroll or not for example sometimes you want to display the banner ads and that banner ad need not be scrolled completely so you can use this scrolling to set to know okay and if I have scrolling let me say scrolling by default it is yes so I remove that and refresh so now I have scrolling option right it's a quite useful hope you guys have understood the different attributes which are available with respect to the iframe tag and how you can use the iframe tag to display some other web pages or more than one web pages you can put the banner ads or different ads using this if I want I can mention the width also by using the width attribute and I can say here maybe 30% and I say file save close this and right click open with the Firefox you can see that the width of the frame high frame 2 is increased to 30% if I want I can mention here more also 50% file save go to browser and refresh so iframe is taking bigger size you can see for banner add I can put here a bigger banner ad and I can try for height also heig SD height is equal to maybe 30% of the height it can take from the browser window save go to browser and refresh so quite bigger you can see that various attributes we have with respect to iframe the most important are SRC name attribute frame border width and height as well as scrolling hope you guys have understood how to create iframes and set up the attributes how they are useful to display different web pages or more than one web pages or ads in the browser window or in your website so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML please subscribe for more
