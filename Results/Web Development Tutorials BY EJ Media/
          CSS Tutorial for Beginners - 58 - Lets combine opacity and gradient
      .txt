in the last couple of videos we've talked about opacity and gradients and we're actually going to combine those two in this lecture so we're going to create a neat effect where we're using both transparency and we're using gradients so you can see here I've created just a very simple div we just have a box here and that's we're going to create this nice effect that will contain opacity and a gradient we can close this out because we need a little bit more room here a little bit more space so yeah we'll save this and then let's just go ahead and drag this over here close this out and give us a little more space to operate here now you'll notice that we're using some of the same code from the last lecture we're going to go ahead and use the background property and we're going to use this linear gradient function that has not changed and we're also going to keep the default color blue which you can see right here if nothing is in our linear gradient background of course nothing is right now so that's why it's defaulting to blue now we don't actually have to use the opacity property here we can just use this RGB a color value and I'll explain where we put the opacity parameter in a minute but basically this stands for red green blue and alpha and it is actually this fourth spot right here which contains the Alpha parameter now that just means opacity that's basically where we're going to specify the opacity that we want and it's the same that we talked about a few videos ago it's zero point zero two one point zero and remember zero point zero is fully transparent and basically one point zero has no transparency you'll see the color 100% and you will also remember when we talked about RGB way back when I did that video on colors and you'll remember there's a red value that we put in a green value that we would put right here and a blue value and we're going to do that here and again this fourth spot right here is basically where we want to specify our opacity and remember we want to colors working against each other that's why we have both of these functions right here this RGB a because we want that gradient effect but we are also going to add the opacity again in this fourth spot so let's go ahead and fill these in and the first RGB value that we want to create is blue so that is two fifty-five to 55 and zero and here again is where we specify our opacity and in this case we're just going to make this zero point zero so this will be completely transparent and now we want to go ahead and add yellow so it's actually zero zero and 255 that will give us pure yellow if you actually looked at RGB value up that's what it would be if you went out to Google or something and let's go ahead and give this a complete value of one so we'll give this the highest setting and let's go ahead and save this now let's refresh our page and there you can see and you know I'm sorry I this was actually blue and this is yellow I actually messed that up sorry when I wrote my notes down here I got these two switched so again this is yellow now you'll notice that this color is first and of course remember it goes in a top-down order just like we talked about in the last video with gradients so this will be on the top and again because we made this completely transparent nothing will show here that's why we don't see any yellow but as the gradient goes down farther it becomes completely blue so let's go ahead and let's actually add a little bit of yellow to this now so let's actually set this to zero point three so let's go ahead and save this well refresh it now you can see some of that yellow is now coming through it's not completely transparent so I think you get a good idea that works and look now we're using everything we're combining opacity gradients all in one nice neat little effect here now as we were doing in the last video you can actually start switching these directions up so remember we did that too right so let's go ahead and put in two right and we'll go ahead and save this we'll hit refresh and there you can see so that is how this works I will see you guys in the next video
