hello guys welcome to my channel this is the eleventh tutorial in this course and in this tutorial we'll be talking about the block code and code tags in HTML now I have a very simple HTML document opened up in my text editor notepad plus plus here and on line one in this file I have my doctype declaration and then on line number two I have the opening HTML tag in a head section in between the title tags I have the title of the document which is block code tags as you can see and then in the body section I have got a couple of paragraphs so the first paragraph has a text Forrest gums mom always said and I quote and then on line number eight I have another paragraph tag opening paragraph tag for another paragraph which is life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get and then this paragraph is getting closed and then on line number ten I'm closing the paragraph that I opened on line number seven right so it's a very simple document let me show you guys how this looks when I open it in a web browser so this is how it looks and you have cents number one on the first line and then as another paragraph you have the next sentence now you know since this is a quotation and it's one of my favorite quotes from you know any or all the movies that I have seen in my life thus far you know I love this pill and I love this quote in particular so since it is a code you know it would make sense if we would indent it by a few characters and display it as indented text right and there are a lot of ways in which we can achieve that firstly we can use a pre tag and we can have a few characters of space here and you know obviously we will have to match the foreign all so that it doesn't look weird and the other option that we have is you know we can use the non-breaking space characters here at the beginning of the paragraph so that we have the entire thing shifted the best and the most convenient way of achieving this effect is through the use of the block code tags now what I'm going to do is I'm going to you know remove this P tag here and I'm going to instead type in block code that's be LOC k qu or PE right and I'm just going to copy this I'll paste it here right so we have the opening block code tag instead of the opening P tag and we have the closing block code tag instead of the closing P tag I'll save this file and when I view it in my browser now I see that you know the sentences shifted by a few characters of space right so this is what the block code tag does and let's say you don't want this block you know this entire block of you know text to be indented instead you want quotation marks around the text right so in that case the tag that you'll have to use is known as the code tag or the Q tag right so it's just the alphabet Q and I'd have to change it here to at the ending position so I'll get rid of block code and simply have / Q I'll save the file and now when i refresh it in my browser I see that I have quotation marks around the code life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're gonna get right so that's it for this tutorial I'm gonna see you in the next tutorial in which we will discuss more HTML tags more features and thank you so much for watching this one and you may subscribe to my channel if you have already see you in the next video till then take care
