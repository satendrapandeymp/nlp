hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 50 and can I just take a moment to say wow 50 tutorials in the series so far this is crazy and if you guys can remember my old series on HTML HTML elements was actually only 47 so I've definitely included a little bit more content in here which has made the series a little bit longer and that is exactly the purpose why I decided to reboot the series but enough about that let's go on and talk about what we're really here to do and that is talk about the labels and field sets okay so I'm going to start off with field sets and you guys will notice that I have already got some form elements in my form okay so I'm not starting from scratch in this tutorial but what I did here was just put in a personal info information where I asked the user for their first name and their last name and there's an input element of type text for both of those and then I've given up put up a hobby section where they can choose between sport gaming art and acting as a hobby okay so if I were to run this in Firefox right now this is pretty much what I get the word personal info and then they can fill in a first name a last name and pick a hobby okay and then they can click Submit but now the reason why I grouped everything like this is because I want personal info to be under one big group and the way I can do that is by using a field set okay so what I'm going to do is just surround this entire block over here with a fieldset tag and I'm going to start that off over here so field set and I'm going to end that off just before that break tag actually so filled sit ok I'm going to actually have to end that off so I need my closing slash so now I actually have a fieldset and I can indent all of that so that I know it all belongs in this field set the next thing I want to do is actually just change this personal info tag over here or label because I don't want that just to be plain text with a break tag on the end I would much rather prefer that to be a legend ok because whenever you're using a field set you can use a legend to determine what data needs to go inside of that field set so in other words this legend is basically like a header but it doesn't get bolded and if I go back and I click refresh over here you can see I now have one field set which has made a border go all the way around our elements over here and the legend appears in the top of this field set so in other words the legend is kind of like a header but not really because it's not bold and it's not big but you know it kind of just tells you what information needs to be filled in in this block ok and we can do the same thing over here with our hobbies so I'm going to go ahead and do that just get that fieldset tag over there and that one over there whoopsie I pasted it instead of copied kay so copy and paste and let's just send all of that forward and I'm also going to change that from that to hobbies ok and now we've got another field set appearing with our checkboxes and our check boxes appear in this hobbies field set so this is nice for you know just organizing your form if you wanted to look a lot more tidy then you can go ahead and add in a field set or a bunch of field sets and instantly it looks a lot more tidy it just looks a lot easier to read and then you can use CSS later on to actually style that this and just improve upon the looks and just make it even better looking okay so now we can go ahead and actually start talking about labels which I have left for lost and as you can see right now I am already using labels next to my elements over here but I didn't include them in label tag so you would have noticed over the past couple of videos that I just didn't put any tags around the words in front of my input elements okay so it would probably be better if I surrounded them in a label tag just like this label and ending label okay and a normal label tag just like that won't make any visual changes so right now you can see I've got my first name this word first name surrounded by label tags but if I've saved that and refreshed it in Firefox you can see nothing changes visually okay so this name or this first name the word first name did not change okay but it is useful to have this word first-name surrounded by those label tags because we can use that label tag later on and style it to be exactly the same size so all our labels would be the same size and therefore it will make our form look a lot more tidy again because if you take a look at this form now I'm going to zoom in you can see that this text element is slightly in front of this text element and that's kind of annoying that they don't line up it would obviously look a little bit more tidy if they lined up so we can go ahead and use CSS to style those label attributes or label tags but I'm going to do that in the next video so if you guys want to see that then come back for the next video but we're not finished yet because there's still another attribute then I want to talk about that goes in this label tag for now let's go ahead and just place all of our labels into actual label tags so I'm just going to copy this and try paste everything as fast as I can so that is not supposed to be there that was a mistake oops I get rid of that and start pasting in here again and here okay save that again and like I said it doesn't make any visual changes so I don't need to refresh this in Firefox just yet but what I do want to talk to you guys about is an attribute for our label tag which is actually called 4f o our what this attribute does is it will link our label to whatever element this label was meant to be linked to so right now and this first name label should be linked to this input element with the name of first name okay and the way we can actually link these two tags is if I put in some information in this four attribute so I'm going to say that this is for first name but whenever I do this I have to link to the ID of this input element and right now we don't actually have an ID so I'm going to have to go ahead and put that in and I'm going to put the ID of first name into here and don't worry that this has a name of first name and an ID or first-name that's okay because the name is what gets sent through on the back when I'm on the URL or in the post daughter whenever this form is submitted but the ID is more for in browser stuff so they can be both the same it doesn't matter and they're intended for different purposes okay and what I'm going to do is carry on just adding the four attribute to the rest of these elements so I'm going to pause the recording right here okay so I'm back and you guys should see quite a few changes what I did was I just added this four attribute into every one of my labels and I gave all of my elements an ID and then I also notice that I forgot to give each one of these check boxes over here and name so I just went ahead and added all those names in as well so you will notice I had that difference in the pause between the pause so anyway let's go back to Firefox now and click refresh and as you can see having that label didn't change any visual appearance but let's take a look at what happens when I click on this label now so when I click on first name now you can see that my cursor gets focused in on to this text element here and actually I can start typing and if I backspace and I go out of that let me click on the label sports and as you can see now that I clicked on that my check box for sport got ticked same thing with gaming and art and acting and what happens and why that happens sorry is because we've got this four attribute in our label okay let's say I were to take this four out of art or and acting so let's go ahead and save that now come back here click refresh and maybe I can just run this in Firefox brand new so everything is and not ticked now what happens is this art label and this acting label don't have that four attribute inside of them as you can see so I'm clicking on this label and nothing's happening but let's go over to gaming which does have the four attribute and as you can see I can click on the label and the check box gets checked okay so that's one nice feature about having a label is when you're using that four attribute and the user can click on the label itself and gets entered in onto the elements that it was meant for and that's all I have for you guys in this tutorial so don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share
