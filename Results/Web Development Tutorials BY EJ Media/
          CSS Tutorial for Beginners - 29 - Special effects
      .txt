welcome to the 29th beginning tutorial on CSS today we're going to add special effects so first let's open up our web page and let's take a look at the source and this is where we added that anchor element to add a link to our shark HTML page in the last video and so we're going to go ahead and add some special effects to this a element so let's do that let's open up the web page first though and we'll scroll down here now every day when we go to websites and we click on links most of the links that you click will have CSS special effects and what do I mean by that well if you hover over the link sometimes the link will change color it will be highlighted or there'll be an underline over it and then if you click this link and leave this page and then later on come back to this page you'll notice that the link changes color to tell you that you've already been to that link sometimes it changes gray or purple and so that's what we're going to do in this video we're going to add some special effects to this link so let's go ahead and close out our web page and let's open up our famous stylesheet and let's scroll down here and we'll add some new code as we always do at the bottom of the page now I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste the code because I already typed it out and as always I will explain it to you and so these are the three new rules that we're adding and you're going to take a look at this and go whoa what is this well I'll explain it all now these are called pseudo classes now don't get worried about that right now I will explain those in a few minutes but let's take a look this is the first rule that we set and here is the anchor tag now what's different is we're putting in a colon here we haven't done that before and that identifies this as a pseudo class and again I'll explain what a pseudo class is in a minute now this represents a state and what we're doing here is basically saying hey we want this link to be blue when nothing has happened to that link right and that's what's happening right now it's always blue so we're not really doing anything different here now if we go down to our next rule this is going to be the visited color and this is actually a gray we're going to use a code here so I put in a gray so when we click on our link in our webpage and we come back to it the link will turn gray that's all this does and then there's this third rule right here which is hover and this is kind of a neat one so when we hover over our link now with the mouse the color of the text now will change and I think this is like an orange color and you'll see that in a moment now the question you might ask is why can't I dump all of this into one rule and that's a good question and the answer is these are States think of them like States and we really don't want all these states in one rule because they would all happen at the same time and that defeats the purpose we only want this in one state at a time it's kind of like the yin and the yang of the universe it can only be one at any given time or think of it like you're in a mental state you can either be happy you can be angry you can be sad but you can't be all three at the same time and that's kind of what's going on here we don't want all three of these display at the same time we only want one of them displayed at the same time because that's the given state it's in at that time so that's why we will separate these and not dump them all into one rule and you want them in this order to for this to work good so you can actually save and reuse this code for your future web pages you want the link first the visited second and the hover third always keep it in this top-down order and it'll work very nicely for you so let's go ahead and save our stylesheet and let's go to our web page and now let's go down here and you'll notice now when we hover over the link the link is now orange and so the hover State is getting activated when the mouse goes to another section of the page it returns to the other State the link stick which is blue so this is letting us know hey your hovered over this link so let's click on it and we'll go to our shark page great now let's go back to our page open it up act like we're a user here and look we've got our new state it's grey and so that is the visited CSS rule that we set and we said hey turn this gray to let the user know you've already been there so there you see all three states that this link can be in and again you can reuse this code for your web pages that you design okay so let's close this out now I want to explain again pseudo classes now you might be going well what's going on here well I don't know if you notice but we never put a class in our HTML let's go open up our HTML here we didn't put any class here everything else we've had to put classes right or styles and that's why it's called a pseudo class you do not have to actually specify a class in the HTML the browser just knows to go ahead and style this this a element automatically and so that's why it's called a pseudo class it operates like a class but it's not really a CSS class in the way we think of it because we don't have to put anything in our HTML and again a pseudo class is identified by this colon right here now if we took that colon out we have all kinds of problems because then it wouldn't realize it's a pseudo class and it would probably be looking for some sort of class in the in the HTML okay and as always I will post this style sheet on the message board so you guys can go ahead and use it so I will see you guys in the next video
