hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series let me right click on the default dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize I right-click the frame 1 dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize I right click on frame 2 dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize I recollect the default dot HTML page open with the Firefox this is how it looks minimize array click on frame 1 dot HTML open with the Firefox this is how it looks minimize a right-click frame 2 dot HTML open with the Firefox this is how it looks in the previous tutorial we understood that normally browsers display only one web page at a time it is possible to display more than one web pages in a browser window at a time by dividing body section into different frames to divide body section into different frames we need to take help of HTML frame set tag and HTML frame tag to use frame set tag we need to omit body tag in place of opening body tag we write opening frame set tag and in place of closing body tag we write closing frameset tag there are two important attributes available with respect to frame sector they are rows and calls calls indicate number of columns rows indicates number of rows we can give comma separated values to rows and columns attribute either in pixels or in percentage number of values indicate number of frames frame tag is a child tag of frame set tag frame tag is an unpaid attack SRC attribute with respect to frame tag indicates a web page to be displayed in the respective frame name attribute indicates name of the frame used in anchor tag we discuss about it soon ok I know you people have many doubts and questions let me clear those in this tutorial here you can see that frame set tag we have used and we mentioned number of columns 50% 50% you can see browser has divided the body section into two different frames and in the first frame it is displaying the frame one dot HTML page in the second frame it is displaying frame two dot HTML page and here this is a core of frame one dot HTML page and this is a code of frame two dot HTML page as I told that we can give values in percentage as well as in pixels here I have written 50 percent that indicates the width of the first frame right now if you do not want to write the width of the second frame then you just need to write star if you write star browser will automatically calculate what should be the width of the frame which is the second frame here frame two so 50% means the second frame width should be 50% right browser will automatically calculate that file save your browser and refresh no change you can see that if I change here to 10 percent first frame will be 10 percent of course the remaining percentage is 90 percent automatically browser places here 90 percents you can think like that so Frame 2 will be having 90 percent file save go to browser refresh you can see that frame 1 is of 10 percent frame 2 is of 90 percent as I told we can give in pixels also if I tell here 100 px first frame will be of 100 pixels I don't know total number of pixels available in the width so I just mentioned here comma star let the browser calculate the number of pixels for the second frame file save go to browser and refresh you can see that automatically changes happen if I change here to 366 pixels file save go to browser and refresh automatically browser calculates the width for the next frame we can create one more frame also if we want it's quite easy right so here I am going to tell create one more frame frame name is going to be fr AME frame 3 double quotation SRC it should display a page with the name frame three dot html' for a slash letter then file save here I am going to mention for example the first frame width should be ten percentage comma second frame should be of 25 percentage and the third frame I do not want to calculate I just want to put it star let the browser calculate now if I say file save good browser and refresh you can see that browser has created three different frames and the first frame is of 10% of the browser width and second frame has 25% of the remaining word and frame 3 has the remaining percentage now here we have the information you can observe in the frame 3 it is telling file not found because we don't have frame 3 dot HTML page created what I need to do I need to create one more page with the name frame 3 dot HTML so I right-click the frame 2 got HTML page open with the notepad and here I change it to frame 3 here I change it to frame 3 file save as and I give name as frame 3 dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and click on save button frame 3 dot HTML got created I close the window and now I come back and refresh check that out now it is displaying here frame 3 hope you guys are understanding how it works step-by-step it's quite important guys try to understand now we understood what is the meaning of star and how to create one more frame and add it I can change it to Rose also right Rose file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it has changed to Rose let me put it back to calls see OLS calls file save go to browser and refresh now I am going to discuss about the importance of the name attribute we know what is the use of SRC attribute but we have not used yet the name attribute value anywhere right let's talk about that this time what I do I create one more page which is going to be framed for dot HTML right click open with the notepad and this is going to be frame 4 dot HTML page file save as frame 4 dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and click on the Save button close it now we have frame for I right click the frame 1 dot HTML open with the notepad in this page I am going to create one hyperlink anchor tag h r EF hyperlink reference and here i am going to tell frame four dot HTML click me here closing anchor tag file save now we know that if I right click open with the Firefox the frame 1 dot HTML page if I click on the click me you can see that it is displaying frame for frame 4 dot HTML page got open let's see what happens in the frame set refresh you can see this showing here click me link right if I click on this link frame 4 dot HTML page will get open in frame 1 area so if I click on this you can see that dynamically frame 4 dot HTML page is getting displayed in the frame 1 interesting right you can display this frame 4 dot HTML page in frame 2 or frame 3 also instead of displaying in the same frame let me talk about that now what I do this time I open the frame 1 dot HTML page in notepad you can see here I am adding one more attribute called as target and there we know that target attribute takes different values like underscore self to open the frame four dot HTML in the same page if you want to open the frame four dot HTML in another window then we write underscore blank do you remember that similarly I can write here the frame name also target frame name so here I am writing frame 3 that is the name of this frame the name of this frame is frame 3 let me save it file save and minimize right click open with the Firefox this time if I click on click me link frame 4 will get open in frame 3 here this frame 3 will get changed to frame 4 if I click on this you can see that it is displaying here frame 4 dot HTML page in the frame 3 let me close this and show you here I change it to frame to file save minimize right click open with I have Fox this time if I click on click mean link frame 4 dot HTML page will get open in frame 2 you can see that in the frame 2 we are seeing frame 4 dot HTML page content so that is the use of name attribute how we can use the name of the frames in hyperlinks when we work with the frame set down hope you guys have understood what is the importance of name attribute what is the importance of SRC attribute how we can use and how do we create frame sets so for this tutorial this much is inner friends I suggest you people to try this yourself create some different frames set and understand whatever I explain for more benefits please subscribe to YouTube channel and don't forget to Like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much
