welcome back today we are going to be focusing on navigation how would you create a navigation list for your website and this is something that every website shares in common so of course it's really important that you learn how to do this and it's really easy let's take a look at an example first if we take a look at net huts you can see right here we have a list of navigation links now what these do is they allow us to sort the postings on the website according to category and tags so let's learn how we can do this on our own fictional web site I'm going to open up my code editor and of course we have a blank style sheet in a skeleton HTML file which links to the style sheet this all should be very familiar to you at this point now I give you a hint and I noted that we need to create a list of navigation links and when I use that keyword when you can describe content as a list then you should be using an unordered list now within this list we should have a list item containing an anchor tag which links to the desired page I'll create that now and we'll have a her F and we'll set the value to a pound sign because we don't have an actual website in this case so we'll link simply to pound which means nothing and we'll call it home and I will close out my anchor tag next I will duplicate this a few times and we'll have our various pages so we could have an about page perhaps a portfolio page and then lastly maybe contact this is fairly common so let's see how this alone looks in the browser and this is probably what you would expect we have a nice list containing anchor tags each one will take us to the desired page but now you might be thinking well Jeff that doesn't look anything like the inline list of links on net tuts okay that's okay because remember the visuals how it's displayed on the page has nothing to do with the markup our goal with the markup is to use semantic elements that describe what the content is it has nothing to do with the visuals because we can always override that with our stylesheet so let's do that now first I will change the display by default list items have a display of list item what they would call list item but in this case we want them to display in a line or inline so let's adjust it to inline and see what we get with that bolon if i refresh sure enough we've gotten rid of the bullets because it's no longer set to a list item display and now they're displaying in a line now the way this works is they will display in a line as long as possible until the width of all of the links combined add up to more than the width of their container to give you an example watch what happens if we set their container an unordered list and we get of a width of 150 pixels if I reload the page you can see once it got the contact the width would have been too much so they are bound to that 150 pixels in which case it needs to drop to a new line I'm going to remove this and our next step is we probably don't want these underlines there that kind of looks tacky all right with CSS this is easy we're going to grab the anchor tags and note I'm being very general here this is referring to all anchor tags and your entire website if you want to limit it to only the anchor tags that are perhaps within an unordered list you might want to do something like this or you could also do this next we're going to set text decoration to none meaning we don't want any underline or anything like that if I reload the page now those are gone the next step is why don't we use a nicer font so rather than using Times will apply a font family and you've learned about this of sans-serif and this will use the most appropriate font of that type and on your computer that will likely be Helvetica or Arial okay that looks a little bit better but now you might be thinking well it could use a little more spacing between each item that's easy to will say with the list item give it some padding right for each one and we'll say 10 pixels worth and now if I reload pay attention you have just a little bit more room as you can see right there so the next thing you might be thinking is well when I hover over this other than the fact that the cursor changes to a pointer it's not easy to tell that these are clickable links so why don't we provide a little bit more visual feedback and we will apply the underline again when you hover over the anchor tag and we do that by using a pseudo class so watch what happens when I do a colon hover this is a pseudo class meaning when you hover over the element it is attached to in this case an anchor tag and in this case we'll say text decoration and we're going to add that back on I'll save it reload the page and now when I hover over it sure enough we now have underlines good so what you can see here is it's really very easy to style a navigation list however you want if you want to change the font size for some crazy reason maybe we'll say 30 pixels this is going to look awful but it's to note that you can apply any styling you want so you can create these little miniature animations as you can see right there now I don't recommend you ever do this because it's not great for usability but it's good to know it's possible if you decide you want to change the color maybe to black when you hover over it but you want the default color to be maybe a grayish color you can do that refresh it's gray hover over it we underline it and we turn the text black and what's nice about this is because we're doing CSS we can control the visuals however we want if we decide that we don't want this to be a horizontal navigation menu we can bring it back to vertical easy as pie and that's the point of CSS it gives us full control over the styling of our website and note that when we want to make these changes we never have to edit our markup there should be a separation markup is for content CSS files are for styling so good job in the next lesson we're going to take a look at forms
