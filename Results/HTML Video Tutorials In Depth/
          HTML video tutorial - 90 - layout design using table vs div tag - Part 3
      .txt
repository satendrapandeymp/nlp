hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series from the past few video tutorials we are trying to design layout by using table as well as by using do and we are trying to understand how we can create or design a layout by using table and div tags in the previous video tutorials we have created the layout something like this by using table and the layout something like this by using div which are quite similar what I want in this tutorial is I want to add my name and email id in the header section in the header section on the left hand side I want to display my name on the right hand side I want to display email id so how do we do that by using the table tag we are going to understand first as you can see here we have a table inside that we have a content called as header I am going to remove that in this TD I am going to create a table opening table and closing table and this table is going to have one table row opening table row and closing table ho and this table row is going to have Teddy's losing TD it is going to have here a TD and a closing TD in this TD I am going to put my name that is going to be mr. Munsu not chid are he3 and in this TD I am going to put my email id that is going to be mass 4 5 6 double eight at the rate gmail.com and let me put here border of two pixels and I let me say the BG color also BG color of sign double quotations we know that now it is going to have a border of two pixels and BG color sign file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now we have a table there we have the content also what I can do is I am going to set the width of 100% so that it's get stretches here I am going to set the width is equal to 100% now when I set the tape 100% this complete TR is going to be 100% this state is going to take 50% this theory is going to take 50% with file/save good browser and refresh you can see that now we have two TD is visible properly and now what I want is if you see carefully mass four five six double eight at gmail.com the email is on the left hand side aligned so I want to align it to the right hand side what I can do is I can go to the TD and add a align attribute and say righ T right if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh the content is moved words right you can see and also I want to increment the font size it's a small font size let me increase the font size here so to do that we are going to use font size I set for and here I am going to say closing font tag same thing I am going to do for email id also so I am pasting it and here I'm going to close the font that file save good browser and refresh font size got increased you can see that and also I do not want the broader and all I am going to remove that so I do not want border I said the border to zero pixels and BG color is going to be I am going to remove the BG color because PG color already we have set somewhere as a black that will be the same if I save file save good browser and refresh you can see that the table border is removed background car is removed and also as we know that the text color E is black by default we can't see the text so what I do is I am going to set the font color here to white and here also same thing I say color to WH ite white if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh that is how it looks now now I added my name as well as the email ID same thing I want to do using the div tag in our layout design using TV HTML how do we do that now I need to convert this to the div what I think is I consider each TD as one one div you can see here we have layout using the attack code I am going to remove this and now in this I am going to create Dave's first Dave closing dip and it is going to have one more Dave here and I am going to say closing Dave and this dip is going to contain the name mr. ma and Ju n-ath monsoon Archie Dre and it is going to have an email id also mass four five six double eight at the rate gmail.com of course give our block label tags and let me set the CSS to them first thing I set the style I say background - color to cyan semicolon double quotation for this dour tip also I set the style of background - color science semicolon of course both tubes are going to be displayed one below another you can see that file save go to browser and refresh we have two deals one below another and they are taking the entire width right so what I can do is first thing I am going to set the width W ID th width of 50% of the browser width or its parent width it should take and Here I am going to say W ID th width of 50% semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that they are now taking the width of 50% one of the thing you can see that gives our block level tags say they are displayed one below another as we have learnt the float property now we can use that here so here I say float L EFT left semicolon once I set the float left this div is going to be floated to left file/save good browser and refresh and of course you can see that the pillow dave is still not full floated to the upward what i can do is i can set to that also FL ovt float le ft left from e : when I float both of them to the left side of the browser width you can see that they are now one beside another and also you can observe the content he is on the left hand side of the deal so I need to align it to the right hand side to do that very simple thing I am going to use another attribute called as text - hey Li ji and align and I set it to ri ght right so this depth content text should be aligned to the right height side file save good browser and refresh can see that text is aligned to the right hand side and also I want to set the font color to right and font size to 4 to do that as we are using div tags I do not want to use the font tag instead of that I am going to use fan tag so opening span and closing pantac Here I am good right opening span and Here I am going to write a closing fan tag and I am going to use the style attribute their style equal to in double quotations I set color white semicolon for this also same thing I do tile equal to color WH ite white semicolon double quotations file save go to browser and refresh you can see that text color changed to white I can remove the background color of both the dibs so I go to layout design using this I am going to remove this background color sign from the style attribute here also same thing I just align it properly file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have the content visible but the content is little bit smaller let's increase the size what we can do to increase the size is we can use the font - size attribute and here I am going to say 18 point semicolon here I'm going to say font - size of 18 point semi colon file save and let's see whether 18 point suits proper or not I think content that we have is more larger let me decrease the size I am going to set the font size to 12 points and we check once file save good browser and refresh 12 points is more smaller let me change it to 14 points file save for browser and refresh I think both are now perfect this how we are going to convert our tab -
