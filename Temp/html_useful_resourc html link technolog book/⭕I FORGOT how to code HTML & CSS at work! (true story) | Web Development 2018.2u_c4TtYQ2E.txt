I wish I was joking you nature walk and talk with you guys today check out this green bean tree can you guys see those things look at these pods I feel like there's a little aliens inside them or something those things are so funky looking does anyone know what kind of tree this is I wish I knew my trees better over the past I don't know two months I've been pretty deep into the codebase at my company whether it's a front-end framework backend raw PHP back in framework server stuff lamp stack stuff - the M so basically lap I've also been working on some uber front-end stuff like Photoshop mock-ups and prototypes and wireframes and stuff this is all to say that I haven't really been working directly with HTML in fact I have not been working with HTML directly since I started this job so yesterday my senior developer was having me do some pretty minut things which is most of web development anyway with HTML so I was like yeah all right change a few tags change a few CSS classes no big whoop so I rip open this HTML document and my eyes glaze over it looks so weird to me the spacing the same tags the header the footer just like what is this stuff it was really sad and it was actually kind of scary because HTML to me is something that is just totally usually totally non cerebral even with like html5 api's I don't have a problem working with them when you compare it to something like the weird parts of JavaScript or some of those PHP stuff that I've been working with html5 to me is all right in my book I'm trying to work with these basic HTML tags and also CSS classes and ideas and I could not remember for the life of me how to set up a CSS class and I was messing up the syntax so bad especially like editing these CSS classes and ID's was like what happened how did I forget the stuff so quickly after my brief existential coding crisis I gave myself two minutes to just gather myself I read up on the doc so I was like Oh duh and it all came back fairly quickly I guess my big takeaway from all that is that I cannot take any language for granted fortunately web developers of years past have made our job easier with all this documentation that's easily available on the internet and in books and in videos and so on it sounds like a really terrible DMV campaign for your driver's license if you don't use it you lose it but it is true if you don't use these languages you I don't want to say you're gonna lose them but you're definitely gonna get rusty really quickly if you're not using him on a regular basis I didn't think that was possible with HTML but like I said it's been a while and although admittedly I do have the memory of a goldfish it was still comforting knowing that I could hop back in it within a few minutes of just looking over the documentation looking over the code and just centering myself and checking myself into that mode I hope you guys enjoyed this video of my foils you don't use it you lose it yesterday my mailbox I got a fresh editors copy of how to get a job in web development print edition that was a super exciting personal unboxing that I happened to record oh yes ooh yes yes yes yes it's just another option I'm offering people because I like books I love paging through them and taking notes and putting like little sticky notes on them and stuff thank you guys for watching we'll see you the next video [Music]
