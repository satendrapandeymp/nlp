howdy champs my name is Maya and yesterday I'm gonna show you how to embed videos on your HTML document guys I'll be using Dreamweaver cs5 point-five latest Dreamweaver version to do that okay guys have a look out here this folder on my desktop which is my side is my local site folder and let me show you the assets inside it okay guys we have an mp3 music file as well as we have a video okay and we'll be using both of them in our HTML document and let's see how we can actually do that so let's head straight to Dreamweaver okay now guys this is Revere cs5 five and I'm gonna hit the create new HTML button okay guys have a look that I'll be using only the code view for this example okay now whatever is inside the body tags is actually what appears on the web page so whatever is not let me just select it and let me collapse it that makes working very easy okay cool guys for this example although the video tag is a great way of going about it but I also like the object tag especially because it allows you the parent tag the parameter type to apply certain parameters to read plugins okay so let's use the object tag instead of the video tag let's see how we can actually do with the help of the object tag so that's an opening object tag alright since we have an opening object I guys we need to have a closing object tag - alright and inside the opening object tag guys and need to pass in certain parameters the first parameter that I would need is to point to the actual file and that can be done with the help of the data parameter the moment I select data guys I can actually browse for the file alright and let me go with the a wildlife mp4 video file okay let me just right-click and I just want to be sure of the size of the video let me just go back to my local site folder for a moment let me cancel it up just go back to my local site folder yep ouch you can actually see that the size of the video is final in 12 by 384 okay 512 by 384 let me make a mental note of it okay let me head back to Dreamweaver okay so let me insert the data attribute once again browse for the file that's why life okay then guys and need to pass in the width the width guy wasn't it final in 12 okay and the height width was 512 and the height guys was 384 so that's a 384 okay and that's all that I need to play the video on the web page let me be sure by testing it out so I'm gonna save it I'm gonna call this object underscore param time parameter tag you'll be using the parameter tag in a moment guys so saving it in my side let me save it up okay let's take a preview let's say in Firefox okay guys I've actually stopped the video I'm gonna have a look out here the options to play and mute which are down below out here the seek bar isn't clearly visible that's because I have inserted the actual video size but I would need to increase the height of the video just to accommodate further are the controls the playing controls you know so what I'll need to do is let me head back to Dreamweaver and the heart instead of 384 let me go with 400 to make sure that the controls for playing the video are actually visible too that's important cuz what is happening out here is since this is an mp4 file it's using a plug-in a QuickTime plug-in okay depending on the data type see we are using mp4 it could have been a WMV in which case up a Windows Media plug-in would have come into the picture your browser's should have those plugins guys if they don't you might be prompted to download those plugins but most modern browsers shouldn't face a problem okay so it's we are using the plugins guys and out here the QuickTime plug-in came with a picture but to accommodate for the controls I've increased the height let's take a preview in Google let's say Safari this time after saving the changes to the HTML document okay now you can actually see the controls clearly guys here at the bottom this is for them you know the volume control is the play button okay what if guys you didn't need even wants it to autoplay what if you actually wanted it to play only when you hit the play button yes that's possible using the param tag okay you can pass in the parameters to control the video what if you want the video to loop the default is it will not repeat itself just play once and come to a halt but what if you wanted to do we can actually control that using the param tag and let's see how we can actually do let me head back to Dreamweaver and guys this time what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit the parameters button okay and the first parameter that I'll pass in is auto play okay and as far as the value is concerned I'm gonna say true so I would want it to auto play instantly no let me let me say false the default is true big about okay and as far as the second parameter is concerned I'm gonna say loop and the value I don't want to pass is true the default is false the case I've passed in two parameters that we say okay and notice out here we have an opening param tag out here we have a name attribute which is set to auto play the value set to false and we have another param tag out here you can see that it's close to that the forward slash okay so the name is loop in the value is true okay so what we have done is we basically reverse the default guys and now if I take a preview in let's say Safari let's see how things look like right now let me say okay say yes and there you go guys so for the first time I'm having to initiate the video by hitting the play button and you can see that it actually loops it should loop again wonderful so guys you see that you see the reason why I actually love the object tank is because you can use the forum tags to pass in the parameters like autoplay and loop one of the reasons so I'm not using the embed tag you'll not be able to use the param tag then cool let's see what else let's see what if it were a you know an audio okay so what I can do is I can be in the opening object tag and outs here in the properties panel guys where you see the data and inside the data I can get up here you can see the name the file that is being played right now I can change it I can just delete it and I can say music dot mp3 okay let me hit enter the moment I do that as you can see that the music that mp3 appears out here in front of data okay let me keep every the param tax just the way it is but I cannot keep the height to be a 400m I'm okay with the width is final and twelve that's fine but I should be keeping it a lot smaller let's say around 25 pixels okay let's see how things look like right now let's take of even Safari and should come up any moment there it is guys now I can actually hit the play button to initiate the audio okay and according to the parameter should loop again and again and again which it does indeed all right so guys this is how you can play audio and video using the object and the param tags in combination all right so I hope you liked this tutorial learn something from it and I hope to see you very soon with yet another Dreamweaver tutorial oh good day guys bye bye peace
