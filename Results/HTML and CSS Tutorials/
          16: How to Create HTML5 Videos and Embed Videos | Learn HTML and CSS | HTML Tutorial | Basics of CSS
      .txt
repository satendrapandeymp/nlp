in this lesson we can learn how to insert videos inside our website we're going to do this using two different methods one being action including a video violence at our root folder and the second method is by linking to a video online using something called embedding now the first thing we're going to do is learn how to actually include the video inside our root folder because the second method is going to be easier in some ways and more difficult when it comes to if you want to rescale the video inside the website so we're going to take the basic one first which is including an actual video inside your root folder so what I did here is as you guys can see in front of me I have a basic index page that has a wrapper inside the body tags meaning that all the content is going to stay within a certain width in the middle of my website and inside the wrapper right now I just have an h1 tag same front page now I also have a style sheet the basic just styles the wrapper and gets rid of any kind of margins and padding's I might have inside the website so if I were to take a look at inside my root folder you guys can see that I have these two files have the index in the stylesheet and inside a folder I have a video called tutorial dot in P for now when it comes to browser support all browsers at the moment should support mp4 videos now we do have some other types of videos that we could use but since mp4 is - on all browsers support we're going to be using mp4 videos in this lesson here so just in case you have a video and you're thinking well what format should it be then it purports to answer so the first thing we're going to do inside the index page is I'm going to include a video tag and a video tag is actually something that we got included in html5 because at that moment we didn't actually have native support inside browsers for videos who would actually need to have something called flash you guys may have heard about it so it's a great thing that we can today use videos inside the browser without needing to use flash so we're going to be using in the html5 video so the first thing we're going to do inside the website is to include a video tag so we can actually link to the video web inside the root folder so I'm going to say we have a video tag click/tap known to get the shortcut and then we're going to change some of the information we get inside the attribute because we don't need to have all this inside no attributes here so I'm going to lead the path to the video file inside the source attribute because that is not correct I have a mp4 video and as you guys can see it actually link to a video file called video file lgt so we're just going to delete that and instead I'm going to go inside a video folder inside my root folder which I as you guys can see which is where included the video now if you guys do not have a video to play with when you do this little exercise here I'm going to link to my lesson files in the description so you guys can download what I have here so you guys also have a video ok now we're going to dig inside the videos fold and then we're gonna link to tutorial dot in p4 so I'm going to go back here make sure it says videos 4/2 toriel dot mp4 okay now there's a couple of things that we can choose to have inside our video tag here as you guys can see we have something called autoplay which basically means that the video is gonna play automatically once the user enters the page that has the video net now in this example here I'm just gonna go and leave it in if you guys don't want the video to play automatically and you just want the user to you know to play the video once they go into the page then you can just go ahead and remove it like so from inside the tag now the poster here is actually the thumbnail for your video so if you don't want to have some sort of default thumbnail that the video decides for you then you can choose your own image then you might have created using Photoshop or something else and include it inside this poster attribute here now since I don't have an image I'm just gonna go ahead and delete it but just remember that it can include a custom thumbnail by using the post attribute okay now right now if I were to actually show the video inside the browser I have no controls over playing stopping fast-forwarding that sort of thing on the video so in order to include that we're gonna have to include a attribute called controls so just by writing controls just like we did with autoplay we will then get the video controls inside the video so now if we go inside the browser and refresh you guys can see we now have a video going on inside the browse and as you guys can see it also plays automatically though right now I can actually fast-forward down here bottom if I want to do so again there's not a lot in this video it's basically just the first PSP tutorial from inside my youtube channel but we had the video running and it does work now let's say we didn't choose an mp4 video and you want to let the user know that the browser that the chose does not support the format that you decided to upload to the website then we can do this in a slightly different way so right now we have the source tag up here in order to link to the video I can actually go ahead and just copy and delete that and inside the video tags I'm going to include a tag called source now as you guys can see we then get a couple of attributes if I do the shortcut and the first one which is the source I'm just going to go and replace it with whatever we had up inside the video tag now we also have something called the type and right now it's set to video forward slash and this is where we need to let the browser know what kind of video that we link to will be here inside the source right now I do have an mp4 video so I'm just going to say forward slash mp4 okay had it been a GT format video we have written /ot T's and so on and so on and so on so what we can do now is if that browser that the users viewing the video in does not support this mp4 video then we can let the user know that the browser does not support it by going underneath here and then giving them a message by writing something like your browser does not support mp4 videos change browser for something like that and then it will actually display this message here if your browser does not support the video that's on top of here so what were to save put back inside my browser just to show we still have the video inside the web site so nothing really happened - other than we change the way you include the video inside the source files who can actually include an error message now what we can also do is we can also change the width of the video because right now as you guys can see the video is quite big and it stretches beyond the rapids inside of so if I want it to be within the wrapper I can go inside my stylesheet and say that I have a video tag or give the video tag a class if I wanted to and say I want to have a width set to 100% now when we use 100% on an HTML element such as video that is inside another element such as the wrapper then the video is not going to be a hundred percent of the website it's going to be a hundred percent of the container that is inside of so because I have a wrapper that is a thousand pixels width up here then the video is going to be a thousand pixels wide okay because it's inside the wrapper so by using a hundred percent saving going inside my website and refreshing you guys can see the video is now a hundred percent of the wrap and it goes exactly to where the wrapper starts and to where it ends so this is how we include a video by simply linking to a video from inside our root folder but let's say I want to link to a video file that's online somewhere such as YouTube or Vimeo now a benefit from actually linking to a video online is that the video will load faster then if you were to include the video file inside the root folder now another benefit as well is that if you were to include a video inside your root folder the video is probably going to take up a lot of space on your server when you do X need to upload the website to the internet so linking to a video on YouTube means that you don't have to take up a lot of space by including videos inside your server so personally I usually use YouTube node to link to videos now the way we link to videos from for example YouTube or Vimeo is by using something called embedding now embedding is something we have available to us inside YouTube itself and Vimeo so for were to go to my browser go to a random video on YouTube such as my PHP video from before I can actually scroll down to where it says share down here at the bottom of the video I can click it and then choose embed at the bottom here and then you guys can see we get this little pop-up here where we can actually choose which options we want to include when we do actually embed the video inside our website and if you guys don't know what embedding is it basically just means that would take an content from another website and then pasting it inside our website okay so I can actually say I want to show suggested videos when the video finishes maybe I don't want to have that in there so I'm just gonna uncheck it I would like to show player controls because I want the user to be able to pause and continue the video - one - I want to show the video title and play actions if the user does actually want to use that so now that I have what I want to include inside the video I'm just gonna copy what is up here at the top where it says iframe copy it go to my file and then instead of the video tag have included from actually linking to a actual video on our server just gonna delete it here I'm just gonna go and paste in the iframe now as you guys can see the iframe can be quite long and if you're using atom which is the text editor that I'm using here as you guys can see we can't really see the other code so what we can do is we can go up inside you click toggle self wrap which means it's just gonna jump down to the next line if there's no more room inside the width here now forward to save it go and set my browser you guys can see and as you guys can see we now have a YouTube video inside our website and we can actually play it and you know fast forward and do all that stuff you can do in YouTube but one problem with using iframes which is by embedding a video is that if I want the video to be a hundred percent width of example the rapids inside off we're gonna have to do it in a slightly different way because if I were to go back inside my iframe and delete the attributes that is hiding with save it you guys can see that if I were to refresh the browser the video is just gonna scale down to the smallest format that we have inside YouTube now for what you're going to have my style sheet and by CSS add a width to it so instead of saying video we're gonna say iframe because that we're styling right now refresh the browser so you guys can see that we do get a hundred percent width but the height for some reason cuts it off so we're gonna have to do a small trick in order to actually get the video to be you know the width and height that we want it to be inside the browser so in order to give your video a 100% width we're going to do a small trick inside the index page what I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap the iframe inside another container so I'm going to create just a basic div and I'm going to wrap the tip around the iframe so I'm just gonna copy the iframe delete it and insert it inside the div you created here now I'm going to give the div a class so I'm going to set this one to video rapper I'm gonna save it and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to just copy the class name go inside my stylesheet and I'm just gonna delete the iframe you have in here because you don't need it and instead I'm going to style the wrapping that we just included around the iframe now before we continue I'd like to explain why we're creating a container around the video and no to actually make it scale the height to the width inside the browser and this is going to be slightly technical so if you don't know about video with and heights then just try and follow along as well as you can now the basic idea here is that right now the video has the right width but it does not have the right height and when it comes to videos we have a scaling that says 1920 in width and 1080 in height meaning that we need to have the container into the video right now inside of to be created using a div tag has to be 1920 by 1080 in scaling inside this wrapper here so basically what we're doing here is we're creating a container that has the exact same width and height as a normal video would have inside YouTube of Emil then by creating this container we would then say that the video the iframe that we included inside our index page to actually show the video has to be 100% width and height of that container meaning that it's going to be the exact same width and height as an actual video okay and as we start creating this I will show you guys what I mean as we start coding it so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go inside my video wrapper that I have here I'm going to give it something called a precision set to relative now position is a way for us to move around constant inside the website without using margins and padding's now you shouldn't be using precision in order to move around elements unless you have a specific purpose in mind otherwise it can screw up your website slightly if you do not use it with a specific purpose so position:relative is a way for us to say that if you want for example the video to move 5 pixels to the right then I can say I wanted to move from the left side 5 pixels okay so just to show you guys I'm actually just gonna change this to for example 100 pixels go inside the browser and refresh and as you guys can see the the video has actually moved 100 pixels to the right side now not going to be using position:relative known to move around the actual video because we need to use the position relative to something slightly different which I'll explain in a second so what I'm going to do instead of saying that we want to move around the the actual rapper by saying left top right or bottom is I'm going to give it a padding to the bottom and I want to set this one to a percentage so right now because we have a 16 to none scaling on a video which again like I said 1920 by 1080 is a 16 to 9 scaling I'm going to set this one to a percent it's called 36 points 25% then I'm going to set a padding top underneath here and I'm going to set this one to 25 pixels then I'm going to set the height to 0 pixels which means that now if we were to go inside the website refresh you guys can actually see any changes but if we were to right-click and inspect the website to actually show what's going on here now I get this little inspector here that I can detach from the browser so I'm just going to go in here and say I want to detach it and now you guys can actually see it it's inside my other monitor here but if I were to show you guys to actor rapper that the video is inside of like so you guys consider we have a rapper that is the same size as an actual video so now what we need to do is we need to take the video make it a hundred percent width and I'll present height of the rapids inside of or the container that is inside of okay so I'm going to go inside my stylesheet again and inside my stylesheet I'm going to give the actual iframe a styling so I'm going to copy the video wrapper here and I'm going to say we have a video wrapper and inside the wrapper here we have a iframe then I'm just going to delete the styling down here and I'm going to say we have a position set to absolute now this is why we needed to have a position relative up here because even though you guys just briefly gotta explain what a position relative does a position absolute is slightly different than a position relative because position relative takes the video we're standing right now and then moving it to the left top a bottom from where it's actually standing now persistent absolute takes whatever element we want to move around and moves it compared to the container that is inside of so if I were to say left honor pixels then it's not going to take the video and move it a hundred patients from the left side just like we did with relative it's gonna take the container that the video is inside of and have it be 100 pixels from the left side okay so what I want to do here is I want to set the left side to zero pixels meaning that the video is going to be a serial pixels from the containers left side then I'm going to go ahead and say at the bottom here we have a top and set it to zero pixels as well we're going to take a right we're going to set this one to zero pixels and then a bottom and set it to zero pixels which means the right now we're telling it that the video has to be zero pixels from the left top right and bottom meaning that it's going to stretch the video to fit all the sides of the container what walls are going to do here is we're going to say they want the height and width of the video to be 100% because we want it to be 100% of the video wrapper we created up here so I'm going to say width as well settle 200% and now if we were to go and stop our website and refresh you guys will notice that the video right now scales die to width of the video so now it's actually like it's supposed to be and we can actually play it and you guys can see it does actually work so now you guys might be asking me well this is very complicated why do we have to do it this way if we want to embed a video from YouTube or Vimeo well it's just because that so far as I'm making this video there hasn't been any kind of support when it comes to the height of the videos so unfortunately today we're gonna have to do this way with this small trick here in order to get the height to scale with the width and it's something that is unfortunate but we have to do so now we're going to do two more things before we end up this video here because I want to show you guys how to embed a vmu video if you guys want to use Vimeo instead of youtube and the last thing I want to show you guys that we did actually make the video responsive inside our website which is we're gonna get into in the next episode and you guys have requested of me to do so we're going to do it in the next episode and talk about responsive design inside a website which again today because we're reviewing websites inside mobile phones and tablets is essentially something that we have to do when we create a website so in the next episode we're going to get into responsiveness but just to show you guys at the end here I want to show you guys that we did actually create the video in a responsive manner okay so first of all let's go to be meal and I did actually find a video here that is of a forest I'm going to go to the right side here which says share click it and then we get a pop-up at the bottom here we can actually embed the video directly by just saying we want to take this iframe you can also show more options if you want to and remove some of the options here and again the options here depend on what the creator of the video want you to be able to actually see air and then have on the video when you do actually use it inside your website so if they don't want you to remove the name of who actually made the video then you can't do it inside the options here okay I'm just gonna copy what we have here and then go inside my code inside my index page and then I'm going to replace the eye cream we have here and I'm going to leave the height and the width of it because we set that inside the stylesheet save it go inside my browser and refresh and as you guys can see we now have a video from vmu inside the website here and there is actually a short description up here which we can remove inside what we pasted in so as you guys can see we have the iframe here and underneath the iframe we have some text and we can just basically remove it if you don't want to link back to the actual video that we got from Vimeo so just gonna refresh again and as you guys can see we now just have the video so let's actually go and change this back to the YouTube video because I prefer using YouTube videos when it comes to what I include inside websites and I'm just gonna go and refresh the browser so we have the YouTube video now what I want to show you guys is if I were to go inside the stylesheet and change the wrapper to not affixed a thousand pixels but instead a percentage such as if were to say 80 percent which means a right now the the wrapper is going to be 80 percent width of the actual browser so if I go back inside my website refresh you guys can see it changes size but if we were to resize the browser but dragging it from the left and right side you guys considered the video actually resizes in height and width according to the website and this is what we call responsive design because if it were to scale it down to your cell phone format then we can still see the video inside the browser okay if we were to go back inside back code change the back to a thousand pixels and then let's pretend that I'm using this website inside a phone then you guys can see we can access see the entire video inside a phone so this is what responsive design is about so we can actually see the content and shift around the content inside different devices and this is what we're gonna talk about in the next episode and there's something that is very important to learn because today if you don't have a website that is responsive to cell phones then a lot of your viewers are going to click away from your website because a lot of people today do actually use cell phones and tablets in order to view websites okay so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time
