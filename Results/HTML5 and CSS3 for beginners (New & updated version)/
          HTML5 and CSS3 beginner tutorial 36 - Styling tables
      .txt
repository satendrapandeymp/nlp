hey YouTube Mahalo goring its Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 36 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at styling tables so I'm going to show you guys maybe how to make this table look a little bit more pretty because right now it does look a little bit weird right so I am actually zoomed in a little bit you can see that was a 200% so that's what your table should be looking like but to make it just a little bit more clear I'm going to hit control and just zoom in here a little and yeah let's go ahead and style this table up so the first thing I want to show you guys is if you select your table and then you add in a property of border collapse and you set that equal to collapse you can get rid of this like really terrible looking double border so now it's just a single border between each one of the cells which is obviously much much better but yeah I actually want to go ahead and remove that border and add it in with CSS rather than an attribute so let's go here let's take out border from the table so let's remove that attribute save this go back over to CSS and then I'm going to select all table data all table cells and all table headings and then we'll add the border around these so let's go border one pixel solid and instead of using like default black let's go ahead and say in hash nine nine nine so it's going to be sort of a very light gray alright and yeah you can see that all we've done there is change the color of the borders but they're still all there right now let's take a look at actually styling some of the rows to be different colors so in the previous tutorial I showed you guys that you can use these t head and t body tags to basically surround certain areas of your table all right so you can actually style those so you can say that everything within a tea head so you can go ahead and select the head and just say that that needs to have a background of I don't know some light gray color like hashtag CCC and hopefully that changes the background right so you can style the tea head to be a different color and you can style the tea body to be something like blue so again just that background not background origin you can say that that needs could be something like blue and then you can take the next one which was tea foot and make that background red or something all right so you could play around with these and have different color tables like that but most of the time we don't usually style tables like this I think a more modern way to style table is to kind of make them a little bit more responsive and in fact we won't even use the P head and T body attack so let's go ahead and just remove all of those and I'm going to take come over to the code and I'm going to remove those from here as well so that's removed T head and T body and T foot let's just get rid of all of those right so you can pull the footer back in in fact I don't even think we need that footer there but yeah let's actually remove it right so it saves us now come back over to the browser and you can see I've just removed that last row that last footer of my table right and now let's start styling this to look a little bit more like a modern table would look so go over to your CSS and then I'm going to select every table row but I want to only select the nth child so let's type in child here as a pseudo selector right and add in parenthesis so we spoke about C selectors earlier on in this tutorial series if you haven't check that tutorial out go back and check it out but ends child just allows us to select a specific child within our table so if we say to n that will select every second row so n just basically says please repeat this and to basically says every second one right so let's save this now and what I'd like to do now is add a background color to each one of those rows so it's a background and we'll give it a color of hashtag CPC all right and that is going to change the background of every all turning alternating rows so we have the first rows Y the second row is gray but you can see because of the rows ban these one stay gray and the next row turns white and then the next one is gray again and if I were to go back over to this table and add one more row to this and we can just change the name here to Jared what I don't know pick a country and go live right if we add another row here you can see that that row is now white so basically each of the rows alternates especially if we get rid of this row span here and that row they all right save this come back to the browser and that looks a lot like much much better right so something else I'd like to do is make this table a little bit more responsive so one of the ways we do that is to go over to CSS and whenever we have a table we just give this a width of 100% and that should automatically make our table sort of responsive there is a little bit of a problem with this when it comes to actually looking at it on a mobile phone screen because they get really really small so yeah after you change the way your table gets laid out very complicated stuff but for now if you just go ahead and put with 100% that'll make it responsive to tablets and desktops so basically the table always fits the space it has but yeah when you get to like a phone screen so parts of the table start chopping off and there's nothing you can really do about that except for displaying all the table rows like one underneath the other or table cells one underneath the other which actually doesn't look all that good on a phone anyway so there's one other thing I want to show you guys before we end off this video which is gonna help with readability as well so having the alternating row colors at least helps you read tables especially when they get quite large or if this a large number of columns right but there is something else you can do which is add in another styling rule over here so go ahead and select your table row and then use another pseudo class which is hover so basically whenever I'm hovering over a row I'd like to change the background color so let's go ahead and say background and you can really select any color you like over here it doesn't have to be a bright red color like this but I'm just going to hit red or save this as red all right so let's go ahead and save this come back over to the browser hit refresh and you can see nothing actually changes on my table right now but as soon as I hover over a row that entire row then changes color to red so now basically if I want to make sure that I'm reading a specific row in a table when I hover over it I can make it turn red and then I know that this is actually the row that I'm hovering over it just helps with readability and like alternating the row colors also helped with readability and yeah I'm going to jump to the end card now so I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and
