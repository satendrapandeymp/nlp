yo people I'm shelf in the net ninja and welcome to your seventh HTML basics tutorial structuring headings alright now in the last lesson we quickly covered kind of what headings were how we format them and a different types of text in this tutorial I want to focus in on the headings a little bit more and how we structure them in a web page to give the web page a kind of a logical flow okay a bit like a table of contents so we're going to use a range of different headings to do that we'll just have a quick recap on what we did last time and last time we said that heading tags range from h1 I actually said to h5 last time that was my mistake they range to h6 so I'm sorry about that and we said that we give sections of a web page and appropriate heading depending on its hierarchy in the document so an important part an important section we might give a h1 a less important section we can give anything between h2 and 6 depending on where it sits in the document so I'm gonna jump back over to brackets to demonstrate how we can kind of structure these within our web page okay here I am back in brackets and I've got the same file up from last time I have added a little bit more content we've still got the two lines here at the top but I've got a section here for the types of fish we sell that's got a couple of subsections the freshwater fish and the saltwater fish then I've got about a section here and then finally a Contact Us section at the bottom and this as well as got subsections here phone email or by carrier pigeon if you want to get in such that way so the reason I've done this is to demonstrate that we can give each section different headings but for now I've give them all H ones every single heading in this document has got a h1 this one here this one here this one here etc etc so you wouldn't normally do this and I'm just gonna you do this to demonstrate a point and I'm going to open this up right now in a browser okay so we can see that we've got all our different headings and they're all h1 so they look exactly the same now I'm looking at this website and I'm thinking well I don't know which headings are subheadings I don't know which content belongs where it's all kind of like a mishmash there's no logical structure to this there's no kind of weight or importance on certain areas of the website and I suppose we could go into the CSS and we could change the look of certain H ones so for example these freshwater and saltwater fish headings we can make them look smaller so that they look like subheadings to the types of fish we sell and likewise down here with the contact methods now yet we could do that but when a screen reader or a set crawler from Google or another search engine comes onto our website they're not going to care at all about the CSS all they care about is looking at the document the HTML document and finding the structure that way and they're gonna see a bunch of H ones they're gonna be like well I don't know what is important here so we want to do this ourselves in the HTML document so we'll jump back over now and now what we're gonna do is we're going to go through this document and we're gonna change some of the headings now I think the top one here welcome to my smelly fish shop that is absolutely fine as a h1 because that's the title to the whole page so we're going to keep that as a h1 this section here types of fish we sell I would say that is a sub section of the whole page a subtitle of the h1 at the top so I'm gonna change this to h2 and likewise for this freshwater fish heading here I'd say this was a subheading of types of fish we sell so I'll change that to a h3 so we're moving down the hierarchy of the H tags here and I'm doing the same for the saltwater fish this has the same weight as the freshwater fish they're both subheadings of the h2 here the about Us section we're going to change that to h2 because I think it's a subheading of this overall h1 here so h2 and the same for the contact us we'll change that to a h2 and these ones underneath by phone email or by carrier pigeon we're going to change these to hate theories because there are sub headings of the contactors heading and if we have subheadings to these sections then we'd maybe use page four and it kind of goes down the hierarchy that way h3 h4 h5 h6 so let's save this and we'll look again in the browser and now we can see that the browser has looked at the HTML document and it said okay well I can see that your document now is structured correctly you've got all these different hierarchy of h1 h2 and h3 s and I'm going to display that hierarchy to the user so now the user can understand what content is where now we can see we've got the main hitch once at heading here still unchanged then this h2 slightly smaller we can now tell that this is a subheading of this it's not as important h2 here for about us h2 for contact to us and then some subheadings here H 3s which are subsections of the contact to us area alright so I mean that kind of explains how we logically structure H tags I think what we'll do now is move on to the next lesson leave hates tags behind and start focusing on images so I'll see you guys then
