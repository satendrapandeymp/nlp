over the next several videos we're going to take a look at some of the bootstrap classes that you can use with images now if you want to follow along in this video you'll want to copy the image to your bootstrap folder and I will provide a link of this very image that I'm going to use in the description of this video alright so let's get to it so for this tutorial we're actually going to create a grid to hold our image and you'll remember you need three standard things with a grid you need a container you need a row and you need a class that specifies the particular device and size that you want to use in this case this is for a medium device and we're going to use a size three and of course this is for an extra small device and we're specifying a size five so the first thing we need of course is an IMG element and if you followed my HTML tutorial for beginner series you will remember we need a source attribute to specify the image that we're going to use and in this case it's going to be the st. Louis Arch so we just specified arch dot jpg there we go and you always need to use the alt attribute now a lot of people will actually leave this empty but actually I think that's not a good idea because this will actually make your page more accessible to screen readers and other types of assistive devices so I recommend that you always fill this in when possible and what you want to do is just put in what the image is about in this case it's the st. Louis Arch so that's what we're going to put in here okay there we go so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and load this in Chrome and see what we get and there you can see there is our arch but you'll notice that this image is way too large it really didn't fit inside of our grid and that's because by default bootstrap will actually use the original size of the image so this is the first class we're going to specify to make sure that this image is more responsive and fits inside of our grid so let's go ahead and close this out and the first class that we're gonna call is the bootstrap responsive class so we'll go ahead and specify class and the class that we want to specify is IMG - responsive and now bootstrap will see this class and we'll size the image inside of our grid so let's go ahead and save this and let's load this up and take a look at that now the image fits nicely inside of our grid so that's the first class that you can call now bootstrap also provides some classes that allow you to go ahead and quickly style your image so let's say we wanted rounded edges well we can do that by specifying IMG - rounded so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get and now we've got these nice rounded corners now you can also make your image circular and all we do is specify circle right here so let's go ahead and see what we got and there you can see now our image is circular now you can also create a thumbnail and we do that by just specifying thumbnail right here so let's go ahead and see what we get and take a look at that now you see we have this thumbnail effect around the image this little border that goes all the way around it now what if you wanted to add a caption down here well you can do that as well but this is a little bit different and I'll show you in the code now what we want to do here is actually remove this thumbnail class right here and create a separate div and the reason is is we want the image in the caption which will create in a few minutes to all be contained in one thumbnail and the way you do that is to create a separate div for this thumbnail class so let's go ahead and do that so again we're going to go ahead and get rid of this so we're just going to back up here and now let's go ahead and create our div for our thumbnail and since this thumbnail is no longer inside the IMG element we don't actually need the IMG part of that class we can just specify thumbnail right here and that's all we need and let's actually just go ahead and close that out we'll just copy and paste this right here there we go now we have everything contained with inside this thumbnail div now what we need to do is go ahead and create our caption and we actually are going to embed another div with inside our thumbnail div so let's go right here and actually to save time we can just go ahead and copy and paste this then we'll put this right past our IMG element and the bootstrap class that you specified you guessed it is caption Auriga and then of course we need to close this div out and then we need to go ahead and put in some content and in this case we're just gonna say this is the arch very simple or actually let's say Saint Louis Arch you can tell how lazy I am I just love to copy and paste there we go okay let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get there we go we've got our caption now let's say you actually wanted this in bold well no problem was just create some CSS so let's go over to our style sheet which currently is empty and let's add some CSS code and I'm just gonna go ahead and copy and paste this cuz I've already got it typed out so we're gonna call our caption class and you'll remember we always need a period to specify a class and we're just gonna set the font weight to bolt so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and reload our page and there you go now our thumbnail is in bold now there's a lot more to images and we will continue on with this subject in the next video
