in this lesson we will talk about hyperlinks and addresses and we will look a little more closely hit using both text and pictures for hyperlinks links allow us to move from one page to another with a simple click of the mouse you can explore more than the one page you're looking at and that is what makes the internet so interesting and powerful links can be used on text as we've already seen when we created our template file and they can be used on graphic artwork pictures first let us take a closer look at what we did with text links links require the a tag there are three key attributes href this is the address of the target document which can be a web page PDF word doc or any one of a number of other document types target this tells us where to open the specified document download new and html5 this means that the target document will be downloaded when the user clicks the link href is the workhorse of the a tag attributes this contains the address of the target document or location within a document here's a simple example open angle bracket a href equals quote HTTP colon slash slash rod Martin jr. com end quote close angle bracket click here open angle bracket slash a close angle bracket period the target attribute is not used all the time there is one key value that interests us underscore blank this will open the target in a new tab or window testing on some popular browsers reveals that most browsers open in a new tab Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10 opens in a new window the default target is underscore self which will open the target in the same frame or tab opening in a new tab can prove helpful if for instance you don't want your visitor to leave your website when clicking on an external link for example open angle bracket a href equals quote HTTP colon slash slash sarsa silence com end quote target equals underscore blank close angle bracket click here open angle bracket slash a closing bracket download is new with html5 including this attribute in your a tag causes the target to be downloaded this can be particularly helpful if the file is an electronic product you want your visitor to have the target can be any kind of file text audio video presentation picture or anything else of course this attribute requires that the href attribute be set otherwise it won't know what to download the ID attribute is not restricted to the a tag in fact it is one of several global attributes that can be applied to any HTML tag the ID attribute is especially interesting to us here because you can use it two linked to several locations within your web page there are two steps to using the ID attribute first you have to give something an ID this can be a picture a heading a paragraph a span in fact it can be any HTML tag for our purposes it proves helpful to choose a tag which has a visible location on the page second you have to make use of the ID attribute and a link here's an example of step 1 open angle bracket h2 close angle bracket open angle bracket a ID equals quote top end quote close angle bracket heading at top open angle bracket slash a close angle bracket angle bracket slash Aitch too close angle bracket and here's an example of step to open angle bracket a href equals quote pound sign top close quote close angle bracket go to top open angle bracket slash a close angle bracket notice the hash or pound sign before the ID name for this example to work you have to have a lot of text or pictures between the heading and the link to force one or the other off the screen this lets you see the jump when you click the link here's an example of the two steps being used next let's look at some SEO considerations search engine optimization search engines take into consideration the content of your web pages to determine what your website is about one element of this content are links and the text enclosed in your a tags don't go crazy trying to maximize keywords in your linked text but keep it in mind and use appropriate keywords if it can be worded naturally this can help search engines like Google Yahoo and Bing find your web pages we've seen how text can be linked but pictures can also be linked simply by enclosing them in open and close a tags one concern in older HTML is the border attribute in pictures if you don't set it to 0 then you get a colored border around your picture when it becomes a link this can be quite ugly with html5 the border attribute is no longer supported for pictures control of picture borders is relegated to CSS here's an example using the border attribute open angle bracket a href equals quote catalog HTML end quote close angle bracket open angle bracket IMG SRC equals open quote pics / open underscore book jpg end quote alt equals open quote open book end quote border equals 0 close angle bracket open angle bracket slash a close angle bracket there are two forms of addressing to use with the href attribute absolute which means the full URL and relative which gives an address relative to the current location here's an example of a absolute addressing open angle bracket a href equals quote HTTP colon slash slash may Atlantis calm / Atlantis hyphen articles / Atlantis hyphen proof PHP close quote close angle bracket article colon Atlantis proof open angle bracket /a close angle bracket and here's an example of relative addressing open angle bracket a href equals open quote about HTML close quote close angle bracket about us hope and angle bracket slash a close angle bracket this example assumes that the about dot HTML file is in the same folder that contains the web page you are currently viewing if the target is in a different folder then you need to add the folder name say for instance that the target web page is in a folder called data open angle bracket a href equals quote data / results HTML close quote close angle bracket survey results open angle brackets /a close angle bracket now let us say that the page you're reviewing is not in the root folder that you need to link to a page that is in another folder off of route in this example you want to link to an article called marketing HTML in the articles folder but the current page is in the software folder open angle bracket a href equals quote dot dot slash articles / marketing dot HTML close quote close angle bracket marketing strategies hope and angle brackets /a close angle bracket the dot dot slash at the start of the address tells the browser to go up a folder in order to find the articles folder if you need to go up to folder levels you would use two sets of dot dot slash open angle bracket a href equals quote dot slash dot dot slash article / marketing HTML close quote close angle bracket marketing strategies hope and angle bracket slash a closed angle bracket the technique we use to link to a different location within a page is a form of relative addressing that assumes the location is within the current page that the same technique can be used with absolute addressing to open angle bracket a href equals quote HTTP colon slash slash carl martin net / other underscore writing HTML pound sign outside earnest close quote close angle bracket outside earnest in the scientific community open angle bracket slash a close angle bracket notice that after the page is loaded it automatically Scrolls down to the article with the ID set to outside Ernest and now it's time for your action item make another copy of your template HTML file and rename it to site map HTML also copy the template file to your articles folder open up the folder and rename the template file fun foods HTML open the fun foods HTML for editing and make a few simple changes so we can easily tell when we've arrived at the page had fun foods to the title tag add an h2 heading fun foods and change the x's to something more interesting what are fun foods set a space after it and then let's copy this and paste it in a number of times copy and paste the paragraph let's do that a couple of times and add another h2 heading this time let's add the ID recipe save and close go back to your root folder and open the site map HTML file for editing change the title to include sitemap add an h2 heading sitemap replace the exes and list item index dot HTML home new listitem about HTML new listitem articles HTML start a new unordered list list item a href articles / fun foods HTML another list item article / fun foods HTML is time with a pound sign and recipe close out your UL tag another list item blog.html log another list item contact on HTML another list item privacy not HTML another list item this time we're going to use bold without a link because sitemap is the current page and one more list item terms of service close out your final UL tag save the file and double-click sitemap HTML to open in your browser and now click on the recipe link notice that it's froze all the way down to the end of the page where our recipe heading resides in the next lesson we will review what we have learned so far in the course
