welcome to the 12th video on beginning CSS in this video we're going to take a look at italicize in your text but first let's do some housecleaning so I want you to go into our HTML source and we're going to remove the block quote element we don't need that anymore and then I want you to rename this class to paragraph 1 or we're just going to do para 1 for short and then we're going to rename this second paragraph to para 2 and then we're going to create a new paragraph so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this and we're going to call that para 3 that'll be the name of the class and we're just going to say this is slanted text good and let's go ahead and save that and now we'll open up our external stylesheet and we're going to name this one P para 1 and we're going to call this para 2 and then we're going to create some rules for our third paragraph and we'll rename this of course to para 3 and we're going to keep the color and the font size the same but we will add our italicized rule right here but let's go ahead and save this first and let's open up our HTML document again and everything looks good so let's go ahead and close that out and let's go ahead and add some italicized text so we use the font - style property and we just use the italic parameter you guessed it so let's go ahead and save this and if we go back here and open this up you can see now we've got slanted text so let's close that out and the other type of parameter is oblique so let's type that in here and we'll go ahead and save this and you will ask the question well that looks exactly the same as the italic parameter and that is because they do the same thing they slant the text but there are some very minor differences in terms of browser font combinations and what I mean by that is they operate a little bit differently with very specific font and brow or combinations but for the most part they will do the same thing for 99% of your fonts so you really only have to pick one and just use one but if you had a very specific font you may want to do some testing with these two different parameters but pretty much you can just stick with one as I said so let's close this out and I'm going to go ahead and use italic I like to use that one and we'll go ahead and save this now you may ask the question how do I italicize one word and in that case it's actually better to use HTML so let's go ahead and close out our external stylesheet and let's go back into our HTML source and in our second paragraph let's add another sentence and we'll say the word for fish in Latin is Pisces I think I think that's it in any event a lot of times you'll see the Latin word italicized so let's go ahead and use the HTML element tag indent I for indent and we'll go ahead and close that and we'll save this now and let's go ahead and open up our web page and there you can see we've got our Latin word now italicized okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next tutorial
