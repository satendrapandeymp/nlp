[Music] lots of people and welcome to this video so a lot of people throughout my career of doing normal legends videos on YouTube a lot of people haven't asked me how do you Connor the names because I'm pretty sure at least once or twice in a game you have seen someone weird name which has a color like blue green pink yellow blue I don't know use different colors and like I'm not sure if this has been patched I'm pretty sure it has been patched so you're not able to do this but in a few days I just a few days ago I saw a guy upload a video on he colored his name pink or maybe it was purple welcome to the show but I would say like how is that if you're not supposed to read anymore because I'm pretty sure I like done some research and it isn't supposed to be like you're not able to do that currently no longer so basically how you did it before was basically you wrote like a code for a specific color so every color has a code so basically you use that code in front of your name like this and basically after that when you like planning everything your name would be a color and was like is mind-blowing and you can also I type in color like this as you can go to search on YouTube and see different videos on people doing this but I have tried it out myself is trying to write the code in front of like a word and it hasn't worked for me I'm not completely sure if I'm doing anything wrong so I'm doing this video to show you guys how you at least were able to do it back in the days I'm pretty sure you can't do it now but if there's anyone out there that is watching this video that knows how to do it please comment down below how you can do it and I will pin you comment so everybody can see that okay because I've seen a video like three four days ago of a guy who did it but it doesn't work for me I have no idea what I'm doing wrong I have known it but Ito a guy's been jobless it's one to tell guess but I'm pretty sure it is impossible to do it but I've seen someone do it just a few days ago so it doesn't make sense at all but like I said I'm opposed the next biggest but as always thank you for watching [Music] [Music] you [Applause] [Music]
