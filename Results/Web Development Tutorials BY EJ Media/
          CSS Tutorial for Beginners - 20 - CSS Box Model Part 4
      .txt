welcome to xx CSS tutorial and so we're continuing on with the box model and we're pretty much done with the box model I just wanted to make a few more points so let's go ahead and open up our web page and let's scroll down here and take a look at our paragraph three element now the first point I want to make is that the background color property only applies to the padding and content so we can see the content has the background color and the padding has the background color but by the time we get to the border we have to give the border its own unique color okay so let's go ahead and close this out and let's open up our style sheet and let's go down to paragraph three again now the second point I want to make is that you can combine all the padding properties into one so you remember in the last video when we specified padding - top left right we wrote all those individual properties out you can actually combine those into one property and so this right here essentially equals this we're putting 20 pixels of padding all the way around the content box so let's go ahead and copy and paste this over here and so the way this works is this value equates to the padding top value this is for the right this is for the bottom and this is for the left so let's go ahead and put in 70 pixels for the left side of the padding and let's go ahead and save this and you can see our paragraph now has 70 pixels on the left so think of this like a shortcut and it really it depends on how you want to do this I actually prefer to have all four of the properties in here because it's easier for me to read but some people prefer the shorthand so it's really what you prefer so let's actually switch this back to 20 pixels because I only want 20 pixels of padding around my content now this same principle also applies to the margin property so again you don't have to type out margin - left and margin - top you can just combine them all into one property now we can also combine the border properties so let's go ahead and do that let's just get rid of this - color will keep the same parameters and there you can see we've got this combined into one property so this property equals all three of these properties right here so let's save this and let's open up our web page and you can see everything looks the same they are identical again it's just how you want to maintain your CSS code I actually again prefer to have all these typed out but you may prefer the shorthand version so let's close this out now I'm going to show you how to eliminate margins around your elements and that's the value right there as you can see Xero makes a lot of sense right let's actually take a copy of this style sheet because I don't want to save these values that we're going to put in here so we'll restore this one in a minute so let's just open this up now and let's go ahead and set paragraph four to a value of zero and let's go ahead and save this let's open up the index page and as you can see it got rid of all of our margins but you'll notice that the margin up here there's still some merging here between these two elements and the reason is is our paragraph 3 still has margin space so we need to get rid of that as well so let's go back to our source and let's give paragraph 3 a margin of zero as well and we'll save this and there you can see there is no margin between these two elements now but you'll notice that there's still some margin on the side where is that coming from that is actually coming from the body element so let's go ahead and throw up a border around the body element and we'll just take this and copy and paste it up into the body let's save this will open up the index and there you can see that margin is outside the body element so that margin space is part of the body box model so we want to get rid of that so all we do is put the margin 0 property in the box element so let's go ahead and do that and we'll save this and now you see we've got no margins whatsoever okay so let's go back here and I'm actually just going to delete this now because we don't want to save this we will restore the old CSS copy that we had and that is going to do it for this video in case you haven't noticed I have been pasting the source out into the message boards so I'll do that for this line of code that we produced today okay I will see you guys in the next video
