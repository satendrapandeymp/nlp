what's going on guys welcome to your 25th html5 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to start talking about how to incorporate JavaScript into our html5 document now before I even begin I want to mention this if I'm moving too fast or if I start talking about stuff and you guys don't understand what it is it's because you probably don't have a full understanding of JavaScript so in order to kind of continue on with these stories I highly recommend that you go watch my JavaScript tutorial series it's I think it's like 50 or 60 videos if you go to the New Boston comm and look under tutorials for JavaScript watch all of those and then hop back here because I'm going to be hopping into kind of some intermediate JavaScript topics and you definitely need a solid background so if you watch those tutorials you're going to be good to go you're going to be golden so the very first thing I want to do is I want to make an external javascript file because we're going to be typing kind of a lot of JavaScript so I don't want to embed it or else it's going to get messy and another thing I ripped out all of those html5 tags and also that CSS file declaration so anyways just want to tell you guys this is our starting point no CSS files for now so go ahead and hit new and just go ahead and save this as which say if it is Bucky dot J s but I like to use the drop-down menu so J s and you can save yours is anything Jay s and I don't know if you guys forgot this or not but whenever you're working with JavaScript embedded then you usually need those script tags but whenever you have an external javascript file then remember not to write the script tags whatsoever and that's because just like CSS whenever you're writing it in its own file it doesn't need any tags so we'll leave that empty for now but what we do want to do is this we need those tags in the HTML file to kind of reference our JavaScript file so I'm going to go ahead and write script and before I forget I want to mention this in my old JavaScript tutorials I mentioned that you need that type attribute this says type equals text JavaScript but with html5 in a lot of new browsers nowadays the default scripting language is JavaScript so there for you don't need to explicitly tell it that you work with JavaScript because it's going to assume that you're working with Jessica by default so no type attribute needed just go ahead and write your source attribute which is what is the name of the file that you want to include bucky dot javascript so now just go ahead and a scripting tag to complete both of your scripting tags and now I'm going to write three things that are going to help us with this example I'm just going to make three simple sample paragraphs these are going to be pretty boring first and yep this is going to be second and this is going to be third second and third and now I want to give these each an ID I want to give this one an ID of tuna I want to give this second one an ID of let's say bacon because I'm terribly hungry right now and this third one an ID of tuna so as you notice this first paragraph in this third paragraph both have an ID of tuna and the second paragraph has an ID of bacon so if we just go ahead and save this and refresh it we get one two three paragraphs if we click on them nothing happens they're just plain old dumb paragraphs on our screen so now let's go ahead and add some intelligence to this the first thing I want to do is I want to talk to you guys about a new function called query selector so what I'm going to be doing is building a couple functions of our own because we're going to need to build around functions in order to test that what I'm going to be telling you guys in the upcoming tutorial so this very first function the only thing that's going to do is it's going to return to us either one element or a list of elements so I'm just going to name it get stuff so it's job is pretty much this scroll through the document and now this is the method I told you guys both qu ER y SE le ctor and there are a couple of different variations of this method so you definitely want to type it exactly like I have it and now for this parameter what I'm going to write is tuna now what query selector means is basically this select every thing with the ID of tuna so it's going to select this one and this one now this variation of this method is going to return to you the very first element selected so it's going to say okay I'm going to scroll through your document and as soon as I hit an element with the ID of tuna that's what I'm going to return so in this case it would return this first paragraph so we're going to say is okay then we can you know just do stuff to it so what do we want to do when ever returns this we're just right on click equals talk and you're saying okay what the heck does that mean this pretty much means whenever we click that paragraph that it returned call a talk function and you're saying what the heck is a talk function well that's actually a function that I'm going to be building right now function spouts that run talk and all talk is going to do is it's going to be real simple just pop up an alert box on the screen that says I don't like say something yo-yo ma just like that now if we go ahead and run this right now nothing's going to happen because even though we made this function this function is job is to scroll through our HTML file and return an item with the ID of tuna however we built the function but we never called it we never use this function so it's made it's ready to go but we never used it so we need a point where we can say ok as soon as our document is loaded then the very first thing I want to do is call this function so a great place to do this is if we hit window on load and this calls whenever everything in our web page gets loaded what do you want to do we want to get stuff just like that so now let me make sure I have all my semicolons probably spelled something around but we'll figure it out later on and I'm going to go ahead and refresh this page and check it out I'm clicking third nothing happening click in second nothing's happening now I'm going to go ahead and click first and check this out as soon as I do in an alert box pops up that says yo you Oh mah hit okay and now let me explain you guys whenever I hit first why does this alert box called yo-yo ma or Sydney yo-yo ma pop up well because of this what we did in our HTML file is we included this javascript file so this pretty much takes everything right here copies it and paste it right in here so okay we understand how that works now what exactly happens well the very first thing that's going to happen is all of our document is going to load all of this stuff right here so whenever everything is fully loaded it calls this function right here what this function says is basically okay look through our document and find the very first element with the ID of tuna so it looks through our document and it says ok this is the first element with the ID of tuna this first paragraph this one right here now what do you want me to do with that well we just want to say ok now whenever you click that element call the talk function so it's saying ok whenever you click this first paragraph right here call the talk function and all this talk function does is pop up an alert box on the screen that says yo-yo mom so therefore this one didn't work this one didn't work only the first one when we clicked it an alert box popped up that said to yo-yo mom and there you have it there is your introductory to JavaScript I know it I took it kind of slow this time because you know it's been a little ways or excuse me it's been you know probably a couple months since you touched any JavaScript but hopefully you understand it we're back in business back in the flow so that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial I don't know if we're going to be working with JavaScript in the very next story but we're definitely going to be using it later on whenever we're using the api's and all these awesome stuff that spill into html5 so there you go there you have it thank you guys for watching and over you subscribe and don't forget to check out my new website go to the new boston calm and it'll pop up tell me guys what you think so yeah there you go I'll see you later
