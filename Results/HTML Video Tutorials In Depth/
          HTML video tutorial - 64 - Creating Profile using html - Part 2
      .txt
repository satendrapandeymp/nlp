hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad we are creating a profile by using HTML tags in the previous tutorial we just created a web page which is going to be a home page for our profile in this tutorial we are going to discuss how we can create home page layout or how we can create layouts for web pages I want my home page layout or the layout for my profile should look something like this at the top it should contain my profile written then on the left hand side there should be one photo on the right hand side it should display some details and there will be a bar there should display which page it is it is a home page like that if it is some other page maybe education details it should display their education details page like that on the left hand side it should show a navigation bar then some content and then bottom we should have a footer I want my home page should look something like this table tag is not only used to create tables it is also used to create layouts of a web page to create layouts we are going to use a table tag first of all we need to understand this layout and then we need to decide how I can be able to create this layout using a table tag if you observe carefully here we have so many rows this is first row second row third row fourth row fifth row you can see that in this layout we have five rows and if you carefully observe how many columns are there if I draw like this some lines here this is going to be a first column then here I am going to draw a line you can see that we are going to have the second column and the third column that means each row is going to have three columns or three cells I think now you know how you can be able to create this layout by using the table tag let's try to create it first I go to the default dot HTML page in the body section I am going to create a table so you are going to use a table tag opening table tag then I write a closing table tag inside the table tag of course we are going to use a TR tag to create table rows closing TR and inside the TR we are going to create a table cell by using the table data tag so I am going to write TD I'm going to put information 0 at present closing TD I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that 0 got displayed but we don't see any border and all so what I do here I am going to use the border attribute and I set the value 1 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the border is visible let me add one more table cell I am going to copy this and paste it down so we have table data cell created file save go to browser refresh you can see that to the first row we have added one more cell you can see there is a gap between these cells what I do means I am going to remove the cell spacing I say cell SP s see ing equal to 0 I said file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we don't have any cell spacing that's good of course I need to add one more table data cell so I am going to paste here file save go to browser and refresh now we have 3 columns you can say in the first room also as I told that we have here total 5 rows so I need to create five rows right to create 5 rows I need to copy this TR and paste it 4 times 1 2 3 four so total five rows we created file save go to browser and say refresh you can see that we have five rows next thing if you observe I need to have some width set to the table to set the width I am going to use the width attribute in the TD so I say WI D th width is equal to 800 pixels I said file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a table width of 800 and also I want the table should be visible in the center of the browser window so to put it at the center I am going to use the align attribute a lign align cen ter Center file save good browser and refresh you can see that table is displayed in the center of the webpage instead of using the align attribute we can also use a tag called as Center I can put this complete table in a center tag so here I can say closing cen ter Center file save and if I go to browser and say refresh we don't find any change you can see that table is arranged exactly aligned in the center of the webpage next thing if you carefully observe we need to merge some cells you can see that I need to I want the content to be exactly something like this or the layout should be something like this if you observe what is happening in the first row in the first row all three cells are merged and we have here my profile display to create this we have already learned the technique what I need to do I need to go to the first row locate the first cell I say call span how many columns it should span three columns it should span and I need to delete these TD's from here file save go to browser and say refresh you can see that column span happened the first rows first call span is now three instead of zero I want to display what I want to display my profile there so what I do here instead of zero I'm going to say my space P ro file1 I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we gotta text my profile but my profile should be centre of this room so what we do we are going to use a align attribute align attribute what it does it aligns the text to the center of the room so this TD content is going to be aligned to the center file save go to browser and say refresh you can see that now the my profile got displayed center of this table row very good next thing what we want if we observe carefully the last row that is a fifth rows here all cells are merged and also we have a text displayed there footer to do that I have to go to last row I need to locate the last row and here I should say call span equal to three and I need to delete this content from here if I go to file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the call span happened and also I should display here footer text right to display the footer text I am going to right here F double OT ER footer then I go to file save go to browser and refresh you can see that photo got displayed but it is not in the center of this row to put it at the center of the row I go to table row and I say a lign align attribute I add and say Center and if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now the footer text is displayed at the center what else we want next next thing we want if you go here you can see that we have this complete here two cells are actually merged these two cells are merged and at the end we have one cell if we want we can perform same operation or yeah we can do that there is no Anette let's do that I go here to this stable row and this one I say call span by how many cells two cells it should call span so I need to delete one from here and Here I am going to write pH of to4 - I need to place here a photo file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the photo text got displayed and called span happened in this place I should put details right you can see here details text is there so I go to this cell and I say D ETA ILS details file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have details displayed here what else we want next next what we want is we want to merge all cells of the third row and display their homepage at the center so I need to locate the third row I am going to locate the third row I say here see whoa LS PA and call span by three and I need to delete this content from here file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we call span but the text should be displayed in the middle and also it should display whole page there to display the home page I am going to say here content as a home page file save go to browser and refresh you can see that homepage God displayed let me display this at the center to display the content in the center I need to go to table row and I say a lign align cen ter Center file save and refresh you can see that it is aligned to the center what else we want next next we want is a we have here navigation bar but the main content should be merged to cells so what I have to do I have to go to this TR let me put this for navigation so here I am going to say navigation navigation bar or navigation this one let me say file save good browser and refresh you can see that instead of zero we are displaying here navigation I need to merge these two cells to merge those two cells I have to write in this TD call span equals to two and I need to delete this from here and I say here main content main cont ent content file save good browser and refresh you can see that we have arranged the layout almost okay still we need to make it still more better and perfect we do it step by step if I increase the height let me increase the height heig SD height I am going to set to maybe 480 pixels then I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see it looks something similar to our layout that is in mspaint right let me bring it back now we are going to make the content or the layout look exactly something like this you can see here this TD is in this place this TD width if you observe maybe it looks like somewhat around 200 pixels and this navigation bar is somewhat around 100 pixels 150 pixels so we can set the width of these cds by going to the TD of that we have here details here I set the width wi d th width i am going to set maybe 200 pixels let's take file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the width for this table data cell is set to 200 pixels but the navigation bar is more here you can see its width is more let me reduce it to 200 pixels what I do I go to this TR where we have navigation text there I am going to say WI D th width is equal to 200 pixels I say file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that we are getting almost the similar look can you observe if you see this carefully we have got the layout exactly that we are expecting so in the next tutorial we put content and we make it much more better more and more better so for this tutorial this much is enough guys hope you guys have understood how you can use the
