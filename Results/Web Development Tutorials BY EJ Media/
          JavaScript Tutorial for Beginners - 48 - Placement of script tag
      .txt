this is going to be a very quick video but we're going to talk about where to place the script tag it of course has a reference to our JavaScript file now throughout the series of course we've been placing it in the head section and it didn't really matter because we're just learning JavaScript but for production it does matter where you actually place this tag and the reason we didn't talk about it earlier is because we didn't really know what the document object model was but now that we do know what the document object model is we need to talk about where we really should put this script tag now give you a little bit of history the recommendation used to be to actually put it in the head section so you can't actually put it there but it's not recommended and here's the reason think about this for a second the browser actually has to download these files when it's going to render the web page and remember the browser will work in a top-down order so he'll hit this head section and then he actually has to stop and download this javascript file now it looks pretty seamless to us but there actually is a little bit of overhead added when we have this script tag right here and then it'll have to download the stylesheet and then it'll go ahead and render our entire web page and most of that is in the body section now think about this for a second why would we put the script tag up here when this whole document has to be loaded remember JavaScript operates against the document object model so it hasn't even been loaded yet so why would we load the JavaScript file here when it comes after the fact so it makes sense to put this down in the body tag because we want the entire page rendered first before any JavaScript code gets executed now obviously we want the stylesheet loaded and the HTML loaded first so the stylesheet will stay here so let's go ahead and move this script tag and you'll see that it doesn't change anything so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this so we'll get rid of this and we'll go right down here and this is the recommendation you put it right before the closing body tag so we'll put it right there and it's not going to affect anything so keep in mind that our entire web page will be loaded first and then it will go ahead and download the JavaScript file by this point we don't really care right because our page now has been loaded and so we don't care about the little overhead added to download this file and this will also sure that the document has been created before any of our scripts our JavaScript gets executed so that's really where you want to put it so let's go ahead and we'll save this and we'll go ahead and execute this now just to make sure that everything's working and of course this is the same code from the last video so let's go ahead and put in two or three characters here now we should be stopped right and we are and so we know our JavaScript is working okay that's going to do it for this video
