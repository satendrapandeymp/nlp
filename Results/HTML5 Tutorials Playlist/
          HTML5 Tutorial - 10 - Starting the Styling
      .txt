what is going on guys welcome to your tenth html5 tutorial and in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is we're going to be applying a style in pretty much adding some CSS to make this plain-jane boring website look prettier and I'm going to show you guys how to layout websites awesomely so the very first thing we want to do is we want to hop over away from our HTML file and into our CSS file now the very first thing or the very first style we want to apply is a style to the overall pretty much all the tags so I'm going to be setting the margin a default margin of zero pixels and I'm also going to be I can copy this bad boy I'm going to be setting a default padding of zero pixels as well now we're seeing okay that seems kind of redundant isn't that the case with all the stuff why do you need to set everything zero pixels well some elements have default margins and default padding's and this pretty much resets everything back to zero because we want to lay things out very specifically so if they have like a default margin of five pixels it's going to throw our layout off so we pretty much want to ensure that our margin and padding is at zero by default makes sense so now what I want to do is I'm going to go over a few simple tags and just make it look prettier the very first tag I want to go out over is the headings I say go out with embarrassing so we have heading 1 I think it's our main title yep welcome to the new Boston and also each one of our articles in the main content has a heading 1 as well so let's go ahead and what kind of got lost there for a second I do that a lot and let's go ahead and change the font to make it look prettier so I'm going to go ahead and change this to bold 20 pixels and Tahoma I really like to Homa for some reason and the order you need to do this is weight the font weight which is bold the size in the font family and I'm also going to do this too heading to as well so let me copy that beast and I'm just going to might as well keep that all the same except for heading to I'm going to change it to a size of 14 they don't make heading one a little bit bigger than heading two and if we go ahead and take a look at our website we can see that okay heading one is a little bit bigger than heading two and it has a nice two Homa font definitely better than that default times Roman or Arial whatever the heck it was so now that our headings are looking a little bit better I need to tell you guys something else some browsers don't recognize those html5 tags or some browsers also treat them is in line elements now if you remember whenever you have block elements block elements are always positioned one other one under each other and inline elements are kind of elements that get positioned from left to right so what we want to do is we want to make sure that this website is compatible with all browsers so we need to take all those html5 tags and we need to make sure that they're going to be displayed as block elements rather than inline and also let our browsers recognize them so this is pretty much ensuring that all browsers handle our website in the same way in the most simple terms so put header section and you need a spell this right footer let's see wilts that we have a side nav article see Ellie I believe it is come on baby I'll get it eventually in each group and I actually want to make sure I didn't forget anything header section footer aside I wish here was a h-harry Sally Freddie and Ned eight hens okay okay Harry Wow definitely forgot that already I was I'm just going to go ahead and assume I have everything if I see something's messed up later on then I'll fix it then but not my little mnemonic device did not work in that case embarrassing so anyways how you do that is put display block and what this does is pretty much makes all of these tags block level elements so now we can go ahead and move on to the last kind of tag we want to tackle today and that is the body now remember everything is surrounded in this main div tag called big wrapper and that is pretty much enclosed in the tag of body so what we need to do is in this body we just need to text align this to Center and they were saying okay why would I even need to mess with the body if everything else is enclosed in this big dip well in some older browsers as well and this is Oriels pretty much taken care of all the older browsers all the nitty-gritty technical stuff and in the next story we're going to be making everything look pretty and laying it out but you definitely need this or else people are going to complain that your website looks weird so anyways like I was saying in some older browsers you need this text line property to ensure that your website is centered if you don't have this then everything else is going to look nice but it's all going to be shifted to the left and most websites are centered some are shifts to the left if you want to go for that then hey that's all you but anyways this is just to take care of old browser compatibility so now that we have all that boring crap done we can finally start laying our website out to look nice and pretty so that's what we're going to be doing in the next tutorial it's going to be a blast so thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys later
