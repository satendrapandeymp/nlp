welcome to the sixth video on beginning HTML in the previous video we set up a web link to an outside URL in this video we're going to set up a link within the same page and so this will kind of be like a table of contents or we'll set up a link to an article that's lower down in the page and so we're going to use all the tags that we've been doing in the previous videos so first let's set up our table of contents okay so first we're going to create an unordered list and you'll remember that from the previous video that we covered that and then you will remember we have to put in list elements inside that so let's create the list tags and then we are going to go ahead and put that over here give this some space and close that now we need to create our anchor tag remember our anchor tag is our link to whatever it is we want to go could be an outside page which we did in the last video but in this case we're going to link down to a section in this page and that will be the article that we are writing about so let's go ahead and create our anchor tag remember we keep that open and remember we have to use the href attribute to give the anchor tag a destination that is where are we going where are we linking to we're going to put a quote and then we're going to put a hash tag and the hash tag is what tells the anchor tag that this is going to be linking to something within this webpage that something is going to be called birds and so we will call this birds then we will use another quote and another angle bracket and then we're going to type in some text and it's going to be the text for this link which is birds and actually let's make that Birds section and then we will close the anchor tag and let's delete a few spaces here and let's go ahead and create another section so we can just copy and paste that and we will have a section on ducks and that's all we need at this point so we have our menu all set up to link to lower sections in our web page and now let's go ahead and create those sections down here and we will actually let's create some break tags here just to make this a little bit realistic and let's go ahead and use the paragraph tag to create some text and now we've got to create another anchor tag because this is what we are linking to and I will show you how these hook up in a minute and we will do name equals quote birds and then we'll use another angle bracket and here's what we put in some text this is the section actually let's say this this is the article about birds and we will go ahead and close this with an anchor tag and close this P tag as well now this name attribute right here links up and corresponds to this href attribute here this hash tag is what connects to this name attribute so that's how it works we use this hash tag and it will look for the anchor tag that matches birds this attribute name so that's how this all links up and let's go ahead and create our other section and we will just say this is a section about ducks and you know what let's add a ton of breaks here so you can see exactly how this works because then you'll actually see the jump that occurs so let's just put in some massive breaks here assume that this is a very large web page and then let's take all those and go down and copy those in between okay good let's go ahead and save this and let's open this up and we click on the birds and you will see that that jumped to this article if we go back up here and hit the ducks it jumps to ducks so okay and so that's how this works I will see you guys in the next video where we will deal with images
