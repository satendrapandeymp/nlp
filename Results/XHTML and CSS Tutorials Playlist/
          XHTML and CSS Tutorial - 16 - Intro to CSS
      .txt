alright guys welcome back to your 16th XHTML and CSS tutorial and I know what you guys are thinking so don't even say all you guys are like alright bucky we are on our 16th XHTML and CSS tutorial and I don't even know what the heck CSS is yet all you've been teaching me is XHTML and that is about to change in this story let me tell you that first of all second of all let me explain you guys differences between XHTML and CSS XHTML as you can see already is pretty much the basic building blocks for a website how to add all the main elements to your website like images headings arm paragraphs text links it's all the core foundation stuff now what CSS does is it makes it pretty it gives you a nice pretty layout ATS colors to your font changes the font itself spaces everything out nice and neat so if XHTML is the core foundation you need CSS is like the designer it makes everything pretty makes everything look real nice so let's go ahead and let me show you guys how to use this special thing called CSS I just better throw this in there because I feel empty if I didn't CSS stands for cascading style sheet why they named it that I don't know they couldn't name that something a little easier but that's what it means so now how do you use this special magical thing called CSS well you know how we've been working in the body let's go ahead and pop up into the head and add some special tags we need to add two style tags a style open that actually the type type are a sty as weird that excellently tucked a whole new word and I wasn't even on my mind so style and an ending style so for your first style you need one attribute and that is called type and you need to set this equal to text slash CSS so now whatever goes in between your opening in your closing style tags is going to be the CSS itself so whenever you are making CSS you need this every time no exception and it needs to be in the head so let's go ahead and in between these style tags how are we going to start making our website look pretty well let's go ahead and make a basic website first and we'll just write this is normal text and let's go ahead and make a paragraph and right this is paragraph text and make sure you spell everything around so let's go ahead and refresh it and check it out this is our normal text this is paragraph text pretty dumb and boring so let's use CSS to spice things up a bit say you know what we're just going to leave this normal but for the paragraph what we want to do to this is maybe we want to turn it blue and change the font because this font is pretty dumb what is it like Times New Roman or something who uses that anymore so let's go ahead and in order to change any element on your website in between your style tags the first thing you have to do is type the name of that element in the keyword and whatever a paragraph is or let me say this the element name is whatever is in between the bracket so a paragraph is P so go ahead and type P now press space and after that you need to add these little swivel e curly brackets whatever they're called now we already know we want to do something with P so in between the curly brackets you type what you want to change the first thing you need to do is type what property you want to change and there's like a thousand different properties on a paragraph like any of the color the text and you don't have to memorize them all usually people just go to a website and there's a big reference table of all the things you can change about it but for now I'll give you guys something simple one of the properties that you can change where the paragraph is its color the text color so go ahead and type color and then put a colon and now after you have the property listed you write the value what you want to change it to so I know I want to change the color and I want to change it to blue now once you're done with everything go ahead and put a semicolon and you're good to go so here's how it goes this is called your selector what element do you want to change this color is called the property what do you want to change about it and this last thing is called the value what do you want to change it to so I want to take all my paragraphs and change the text color to blue simple enough so let's go ahead and save this and refresh it and check it out our paragraph text is now blue so that is how you can use a really simple style sheet this whole thing called style sheet to change any element on your website so saying alright Bucky that's cool but what if I want to do a little bit more to the paragraph what if not only do I want to make the text blue but you know maybe I want to change the font as well so in order to add more than one rule to your element all you do is this after your semicolon you can go ahead and type another property and value in I'm not expecting you guys to memorize all the properties I don't even memorize all the properties but in order to change the font you need the property name font - family and go ahead and add your colon and as the value let's just go ahead and change this something like a our Arial and remember once you're done with a rule go ahead and enter semicolon save it and let's see what we got nice very nice so this is regular dumb old font and this is nice blue looking Arial font so any time in our website where it comes across something in a paragraph this is what it's going to do to it and everything all right this is pretty cool but it would be a lot more easy if this was you know a little more readable so what people usually do is they separate each rule on the line so maybe the colors on the first line and the font family can be on the second line and I usually just take this last bracket and put it right there because then I can see easier when it ends but if you want to well you know maybe line all your rules up it really doesn't matter CSS is whitespace insensitive so it doesn't matter how much white space is in between you can either add that much and they will still work fine but you know who the heck would want to do that so you know whatever works for you whatever makes it readable for you use it so anyways what I want to stress is in order to use use CSS you first need style tags in your head you need to make the type text slash CSS and for the style themselves you need a selector which is basically what element which XHTML element do you want to change you need a property what do you want to change about it and the value what do you want to change it to so that's the basics of CSS and style sheets um in the next couple tutorials we're going to be working more style sheets and if you don't quite grasp the concept yet just watch my next tutorials and I promise I'll clear things up for you once you've seen this like three times you'll be expert at it so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and don't forget to check out my website see you later
