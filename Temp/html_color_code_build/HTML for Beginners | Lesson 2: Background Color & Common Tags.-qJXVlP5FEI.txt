hello there everyone and welcome back to another HTML for beginners lesson this is lesson 2 and today we'll be covering the topic of background color and common tags so for background color the tag that you're going to do this in you do it right in the beginning the opening body tag so right next to the body in your tag you put BG color and then equals so that stands for background color and then you put quotation marks and in between the quotation marks you can either put a basic color like yellow or blue and that will just be the base of color of your background but if you want you can make it a different shade of color and to do that you can just Google HTML color codes or HTML colors and then in images Google Images and this will come up and then in between the quotation marks whatever whatever shade of color you want there's many different ones you type in a little code that's underneath it in between the quotation marks so for this example I'm going to be using this color right here three-three EE 7 7 so I'm going to go back to my document and in between the quotation marks here I'm going to put 3 3 ee 7 7 so that's all there is to the background color now that will change the whole background so then you can go ahead and save that and then if when you go to preview it you open it up in your browser and this is what it looked like will look like then when you refresh there now you have a background color so this is what our website looked like last time so we're just going to keep adding on to it as each lesson goes so that is how background color work so now for the common tags I'm going to start off with headers so in the body because that's where our content will be I'm just going to skip that down the line and I'm going to start showing you what headers are so headers usually tell like what page is about and you can also use it as a way of increasing and decreasing text sizes too and they're different there's six different types of headers header sizes there's 1 to 6 and 1 is the biggest and 6 is the smallest so when you're doing this the UM the tag for your header is H and then whatever size 1 through 6 so I'm going to show you all of them so I'm going to start with 1 then you close your opening tag with a angle bracket then I'm just gonna for each one I'll put this is the text size of header 1 and then you close it with a h1 as well [Music] so once I'm done with this I'll save it and show you what it will look like on your webpage and last one h6 okay so I have all the headers one through six so now I'm going to save the HTML document and then I'm going to open up the browser and refresh and there you can see the different sizes of the headers this is header one two three four five and six so that's all there is to headers the next thing I'm going to show you is with paragraphs paragraphs of text and skipping lines so let's say you want to break off between the header and the next part so you can put Br so that tells your web page to skip a line so then here I wrote a little paragraph that I'm just going to paste in here probably need to copy at first okay so they're just a little paragraph so usually to like distinguish a paragraph on your page you put a P and then close it with P and then skip a line probably if you want that's all there is to paragraphs it's really simple you can put the peas around like a line of texture a couple words if you wanted to it doesn't really matter and then sometimes you don't even have to use them and you can just put BR and skip a line for you and the next thing I'm going to show you is lettering so for bold text you put a B and then you close it with a B these ones are very very simple for italics you put an I close it with an eye slash all the next one is underlined to you close it with you and the next part is a typewriter text it's a TT tag it's in my gut typewriter kind of format so you close it with a PT and I'm going to save this and preview it here oh I should probably and just for purposes I'm going to put Br after each one to space it out show you what it will look like because if I didn't put VR there so it put it all on one line refresh so over here you can see that's bold that's italics it's underlined and that's the typewriter text format type thing the next thing I'm going to show you a common tag is centered so um so all you have to do for centered text or a picture which I'll be showing you later in lessons let's enter for the tag and then you type the text so and close it with a slash and Center and then save and refresh see you can tell here that it's Texas Center so and the last thing that I'm going to show you is ruled lines they're not really important but you can use them to like separate things like something on your page you can customize them they can have any width size color shape things like that and they do not need a closing tag so I'm just going to show you a basic one here so you just put the tag is HR and then I'm just going to put HR size equals seven and close that you don't need a closing tag and then if I save that and go here you can see that there's a line right across my page there so that concludes the lesson for today next lesson is going to be on links like links to different web pages and text links picture links email links things like that so remember to
