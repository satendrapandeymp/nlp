hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we understood that normally browsers display only one web page at a time it is possible to display more than one web pages in a browser window at a time by dividing body section into different frames let me right click on the default dot HTML page open with the notepad to divide body section into different frames we need to take help of HTML frame set tag and HTML frame tag to use frame set tag we need to omit body tag in place of opening body tag we use opening frame set tag in place of closing body tag we write closing frame set that frame set is the collection of frames or a set of frames you can see there are two important attributes we have with respect to frame set tag they are rows and calls rows attribute indicates rows and calls attribute indicates columns we can give comma separated values to rows and calls attribute either in pixels or in percentage number of values indicate number of frames you can see here we have three different values that indicates there are three different frames we want to create frame tag is a child tag of frame set tag frame tag is an unpaid a tag name attribute with respect to frame tag indicates name of the frame used in an anchor tag and SRC attribute with respect to frame tag indicates a webpage to be displayed in a respective frame you can see here we have created a frame SEC using the frame set tag we created three different columns and each column is having one one frame so first frame frame one is going to be of ten percentage width of the browser window frame two is going to take 50 percent of the browser window and frame 3 is going to take 40 percent of the browser window width in the frame 1 we are going to display frame 1 dot HTML in the frame 2 we are going to display frame 2 dot HTML in the frame 3 we are going to display frame 3 dot HTML page I minimize this right click on default dot HTML page with the Firefox you can see that we have frame 1 Frame 2 frame 3 in the frame 1 frame 1 dot hTML is getting displayed in the frame to frame 2 dot hTML is getting displayed in the frame 3 frame 3 dot hTML is getting displayed in the frame 1 dot HTML page the code is going to look something like this I right-click on the frame 1 dot HTML page open with the notepad if you observe in the body section we have text frame 1 that is what we are seeing here text frame 1 then we have a hyper text or hyperlink with the name click me you can see here it is showing click me find what it does when we click on this hyper text click me frame 4 dot HTML page is going to get open in the frame to this frame 2 is the name of the target frame that we have in the frame set frame 2 that is what we have done in the previous tutorial right we understood the importance of name attribute SRC attribute also in this tutorial I am going to discuss nesting of frame set and how do we nest 1 frame set inside another frame set to create different layouts let me talk about that here first thing what I do means I am going to delete all these frames so that we can start from scratch I'm going to remove all these content delete file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a fresh default dot HTML page and it has instead of a body tag opening frame set and closing frame set now what I want is I want to create two different rows here so to create two different rows we know that we use rows attribute and then we can give value let's take first row is going to take 20 percent of the browser window , then I put star and of course the second row is going to take 80 percent file save go to browser and refresh at present nothing is happening you can see let me add one frame to it so here I am going to say frame name is frame 1 bracket close then SRC is equal to frame 1 dot HTML double quotation for our slash greater than sign file save go to browser and refresh you can see that browser has created frame 1 and in that it is displaying frame 1 dot HTML page this below section that you see here frame I have to make this one as a proper frame instead of using one more frame here a copy paste instead of creating one more frame this time I am going to take help of frame set I am going to nest F R AME frame set one frame set inside another frame set frame set here what happens means this frame one is going to be of 20% height and this frame set is going to take 80% high file save go to browser and refresh no change and in this frame said I am going to create two different columns calls is equal to 20% comma star hit enter here I am going to add one more frame to this frame set I am adding 1 frame frame name is equal to frame to SRC is equal to frame to dot HTML double quotations forward slash greater than sign now what happens here means this frame set that is this below section is going to be divided into two different columns here actually I have one put the double quotation let me add that file save go to browser and refresh you can see we have frame two created here as a column you can use frame set nest 1 frame set inside another frame set to create any layout like this next in the next column I am going to save frame name is equal to frame 3 s RC is equal to frame 3 dot HTML double quotation close file save go to browser and refresh you can see now this time we have utilized nesting of frame set to create 2 rows we created two columns in the below row quite simple right I suggest you people to try to create different layout by yourself you can create a complete website something like this here you can put the header on the left hand side here you can put the navigation bar at this frame 3 you can use for main content purpose right and one more thing you can observe here that I can resize the frame size you can see that I can resize if you do not want to resize any frame then all you need is you need to add another a tribute to the frame tag that is no resize if you write like that file save go to browser and refresh this time if you try to resize it will not get resize can you see that right similarly here also I can write in this place here I can write no resize file save go to browser and refresh if you try to resize they won't get resize what I can do now means I can put some background color for all the frames let's take I go here right-click frame 1 open with the notepad and here I say BG color to orange file save close I click open with the notepad to this body I say BG color to green file save I open frame 3 dot HTML page open with the notepad and here I say BG color is equal to maybe white is it ok file save and close this time if I reach Reis fresh check out what happens you can see now we have here our in here we have green color and this is going to be the main content area and now you can see we have understood what is no resize let me talk about border with respect to the frameset tag if you say here vivo rder border equal to 0 0 indicates no border and 1 indicates border should present yes or no like that so 0 indicate no bond 5 save go to browser and refresh you can see that now we don't have any borders for the frames if you see this layout it is quite similar to our profile that we have created right click open with the Firefox header navigation bar main content area and down I can I have a footer here I can create that also if we want right so quite interesting you can see that frame sets are used for creating layouts also like this so I can create one more frame below I can copy this and paste it down for footer purpose this is going to be frame 4 here we display frame 4 dot HTML page and this is going to be no resize and here of course I need to create three different rows right one for this one for this one for this here we have only two rows so let me add one more row the last row is going to be of 10% height of the browser window file save and right click on default dot HTML page open with the Firefox you can see that we have a last frame created as we don't have any border you can't observe that much let me put background color for frame for dot HTML page open with the notepad here I say BG color I say lig has T light B lue blue file save close and now if i refresh this is how it looks guys right and also we have understood that we can use frame set for creating layouts like this header navigation footer main content here you can display various pages on clicking the navigation links you can display different pages in this place if you want hope you guys have understood how do we use nesting of frames what is the meaning of no resize what is the meaning of border attribute with respect to frame set tag note one of the most important thing you need to remember this it is recommended that never use frame set tag while creating web page layouts or websites reason is on small screen devices like mobiles tablets even on different devices of different screen resolution web pages using frame sets will get render in different ways small screen devices won't support frame sets in a proper way now frame set tag is a outdated tag guys yet you need to have knowledge of these tags that is the reason we are discussing about frame set tags many of the browser's won't support frame set tag and you can check whether the browser supports the frame set tag or not if it not supports then we can use the body tag itself and the way for that is simply in the frame set tag ok after once you have created the layout you can use a tag called as no frames and then you put closing no frames that is a pit tag used for checking whether the frame set is supported or not on the specific browser then inside that you can mention body tag you can use the body tag so that body can be rendered Bo dy body and there you can say this browser don't support frameset quite simple right file save now if I right-click on default dot HTML page open with the Firefox we can see the frame sets properly there is no problem I close this right click default dot HTML open with Google Chrome here also we can see the frame set that means google chrome also supports the frame set tag right click open with the Internet Explorer you can see that Internet Explorer also supports the frame set tag but as I told now frame set tag is a outdated tag and it is recommended that never use frame set tag while creating websites or web page layouts hope you guys have understood what are the limitations or disadvantages of frame set tank the main purpose of using frame set tag was to utilize the bandwidth in an efficient manner that is we can divide the variable and a constant contents we can divide dynamic content and the constant contained separate separate and we can put the constant contents in some frames so that they need not be rendered again and again only dynamic content can be rendered as and when required but frame sets are not good as I told for this
