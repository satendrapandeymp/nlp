hello guys welcome to my channel this is the fourth seed oil in this course in this tutorial we are gonna talk about the paragraph tags and also the break tag or the line break tag in HTML right so I've saved this file already it has the name tutorial - 4 dot HTML and the on line 1 I have the doctype declaration on line 2 I have the opening HTML tag and on line 11 I have the closing HTML tag in between these two tags I have the head section in the body section and the title of this web page is paragraph and line breaks and in the body section I have two paragraphs and of course I've used the P tag and this is something that I discussed in the first hole in this course so to have a paragraph in HTML you know you need to use the P type within the body section and you write text between the opening P tag which is just the alphabet P and the closing P tag which is the alphabet P you know proceeded with a forward slash right so this is how the web page would look you know if you would open it in a web browser so you have first paragraph and then you know some break and then you have the second paragraph now let's say you know you do not have a separate paragraph for the second paragraph right so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to get rid of this paragraph opening paragraph tag here and also the closing paragraph tag here so I'll save this file now and I just have one paragraph and as I said hTML is case sorry is whitespace insensitive so you know all this white space between the first paragraph and the second paragraph is not going to show up in the browser and I just refresh my page here and there you go you see that you have first paragraph and then second paragraph displayed on the same line now let's say you want these to appear on different lines but you also do not want to have a separate paragraph so the way you do that is by using the line break tag or the br tag and it's one of the most popular tags in HTML and it's the cutest tattoo if you ask me so you know all you have to do is have the lesson in the greater than symbols and type in BR between these a space and a forward slash right it's as simple as that save my document i mean i refresh it in my browser i see that second paragraph is displayed on the next line and it doesn't have as much spaces that had earlier when i use different paragraphs for the two statements right so these are you know two of the most used tags elements in HTML and we'll be using them extensively in this course and i'm sure you know if you make a career in web development you would use them lord you know in the webpages that you make so anyway i'm going to see you in the next tutorial now in which we will discuss you know some more features of HTML and i hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you have already seen the next video till then take care
