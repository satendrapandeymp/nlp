one last thing I'd like to talk about with B R and P I'll show you right now let's uh let's make this all be one line again okay so I update this and we have one line if we can put a br tag in the middle of this we don't actually have to have the line breaks in our HTML so when I click update we get our line break no matter how the HTML is formatted so we can format this however we want put all of these spaces in here and when we update this it'll always come out the same there's an example all this white space turns into turns into one single space all of these new lines here turn into one single space you know this text space is really you know you get the idea okay why do we have two different ways of making new lines why do we have a br tag and a P tag the answer is because the br tag is what we call in line and the P tag is what we call block now so what the br tag was actually doing was just ending a line so when we have some text and we put a br in the middle of it it just basically says the line ends here and this guy wraps to the next line the P tag works differently the P tag actually makes an invisible box so when we have HTML looks like this this creates an actual box so instead of this rendering text blank line what this is actually rendering is something sort of like this you've got two lines of text and there's actually this invisible box around text and that's what the P tag does is it makes this invisible box and this invisible box can actually have height and it can have with where inline elements are just text so it the example over here would be more like this so it's just two lines of text and there's really just a little new line here there's nothing nothing fancy going on and the difference between inline and block elements will come up a fair amount later in this course and it's just it's important to know that there's a distinction and they have kind of a different behavior so far all of the elements we've learned other than P or inline elements so inline elements are B even image is an inline element and we saw how before our little Hipmunk image appeared right in the middle of the text that's because it's inline and so far the only black element we've learned is the P element
