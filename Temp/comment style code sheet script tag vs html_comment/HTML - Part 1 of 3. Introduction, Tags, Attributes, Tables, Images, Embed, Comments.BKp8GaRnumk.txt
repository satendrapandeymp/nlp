HTML stands for Hyper documents it was created from the sgml or standard generalized markup language used at CERN the European Organization for Nuclear Research numerous individuals contributed to its development but specifically Tim berners-lee accumulated and published the first collection of HTML elements and a document called HTML tags in 1991 it was later officially adopted by the internet Engineering Task Force or IETF in 1993 and in 1995 they ratified HTML 2.0 the first internet document standard HTML 2.0 has continued since as a standard against which all future versions of HTML such as HTML 5.0 have been based HTML is Austin dynamically written with PHP or active server pages the language consists of elements that are designated by opening and closing tags and angle brackets the greater than and less than symbols in addition to HTML being embedded in PHP ASP code it will itself embed other languages within HTML documents like JavaScript and cascading style sheets or CSS false a note for beginning PHP perl or active server pages while HTML is used on its own by millions for building web pages every day there is a fundamental necessity that PHP perl an active server pages per grammars have a foundation in HTML before getting into the PHP Perl or ASP languages themselves why you will be constantly switching back and forth between these languages in HTML as you use them to dynamically create and write HTML into your projects as your server responds to each client request graphics for months before we go over HTML basics let's examine three graphic formats commonly used in HTML documents and accentuate the differences between them jpg gif and PNG first let's take a look at JPEG false JPEG or a joint photographic experts group or jpg false support a 24-bit color palette and use a lossy compression technique this means that the quality decreases the more you compress it JPEGs do not support transparent backgrounds however they can display many more colors at greater bit depth than other image formats and they can do this using very efficient compression techniques JPEG image files do not support being linked together into animated sequences like gif image Falls do second our gift Falls gif or graphics interchange format Falls use a lossless compression technique that implements a klett or color lookup table to remap an images original colors into a 256 color pallet gift support transparent backgrounds and linking multiple images together into a single gift that's providing the animation capability in the form of animated gif files the downside of using gif images is that they do not support high bit depth color and Donette compresses efficiently as JPEG images third are PNG files are portable network graphics PNG images support transparent backgrounds like gif images unlike gifts they provide alpha channel support gamma correction improve compression and improve interlacing PNG images cannot be linked together and two animated sequences like gifts since PNG files use alpha channels instead of a clot the transparent color is stored as a 4-bit RGB a value instead of a 3 bit RGB value this means that where edges of a gif image may appear jagged on a transparent background the edges of a PNG image will not for this reason PNG image files are used frequently on the Internet there are many scripting languages that can be embedded in and are often used with HTML we will cover these in more detail in other videos but here is a brief summary of the most common ones they are JavaScript cascading style sheets and sequel we will go into more detail about these later here some basic tags needed in every HTML document first and foremost that I've been in closing HTML tags these denote that all in between the open and closing tags is HTML then there's two opening closing head tags which is where the title JavaScript and CSS or cascading style sheet could often go then they are open and closing title tags and this contains the title of the page it's not displayed on the page but in the browsers tab or status bar and finally the body tags and within the open and closing body tags is the visible part of the page that actually displays and the web browser HTML tags often have attributes or properties that are displayed within the tag and these set different properties and values for the HTML document for example in the body tag you have BG color and text BG color sets the background color and text sets the text color you can also specify a background with the attribute key name background and then a gif or jpg file you can specify the link and the visited link colors with link and V link and you can load JavaScript functions and applications with the onload method placed inside the body tag in addition there's left margin and top margin margin high margin width all of these to set the margin properties on a web page here I'm just using netbeans which is a free source code editor does Java C++ PHP and HTML and you could see my HTML tags I don't actually do some highlighting so you can kind of see the open and closing tags so notice that with HTML everything that I wanted to splay on the page is sandwiched between the opening and closing HTML tag notice what the head tags that my title tags are sandwiched between them and this title would not appear on the page itself but on the tab or the status bar depending on the web browser being used the texts and items would actually appear on the page for the user to see and their web browser appear between open and closing body tags so I want to put all that text here then here's in this case a line or carriage return which we'll talk about in a moment and you would actually see this on the page and then you would actually see this on the page because it's in the body tags you just want to be careful for every opening tag in HTML that you also have a corresponding closing HTML tag if it requires it otherwise things won't display properly to see what this page looks like I'm just going to right click and select view and then we'll look at it in Firefox and so it's just a simple white background in this case a basic HTML tag is what it says link earlier they captured Princess Zelda here's some basic HTML tags and this time I included two attributes and the body tag to set the background color to black I used BG color equals black and I set the text to white with text and here's what that would look like here's the HTML embed tag the embed tag can be used to add sound and video media in the form of mp3 wav MIDI mp4 avi and MPEG files to an HTML document here are three examples and the first example we're loading an mp3 we're going to play it automatically with the attribute auto start and we're setting the width to five and the height to two in the next example we're going to play an mp4 video and again the attribute auto start is set to true so it will start automatically and the third one the source attribute is set to skyward sword avi so it will load and play that video automatically because again auto start is set to true here's an example of using the embed tag to play an mp3 file from a subdirectory called media sounds on the name of the follow Lincoln Zelda Skyward Sword mp3 it'll start playing as soon as the page loads since auto started set to true and here we have the hidden attribute set to true so this will hide the control from the page that would allow you to start or stop the sound file now this would work with Internet Explorer which can play you know embedded files with the hidden attribute set to true but it would not work with Firefox Firefox has to be able to display something in order to be able to play it in a webpage and so to show you what I'm talking about if I preview this with Firefox you notice it displays the texts and everything and the HTML source is still there but it doesn't play anything now on the other hand if I open the very same web page and Internet Explorer it will play the embedded file even though the hidden attribute is set to true so a workaround for this is you can basically make the you know here since I'm loading locally I need to click on allow blocked content it's a lot of media player to play there excuse me QuickTime and now you can hear it even though you can't see it you can hear it okay so that's one way of using the embed tag now in order to use the embed tag so that it will work with Firefox we need to make it visible so in this case we're not gonna set the hidden attribute we're going to actually give it width and height you're gonna play the same fall on this time if I load it up in Firefox you can see here's the control over here where you can you know control this own closet play it alright so notice you know the attributes I'm including in the embed tech you're the source which is the directory and name of the mp3 follow that with the Hyatt ought to start being set to true the alignment which is I'm pushing it to the right and repeat which means it'll just keep repeating okay here is another example of using the embed tag and in this example I'm going to include a video an mp4 from a sub-directory setting width and height in current position okay and in addition there's two here so you'll see both of these videos here and let me go ahead and preview that in Firefox again you can see both of those in addition to embedding content that way you can also use the embed tag and place it within object tags and that way you can set an ID and parameters and this is useful for lots of other things like flash videos or real videos or you know lots of other content that you might want to embed inside of a web page so here's an example of just taking that embed tag for in this case an mp4 video and placing that inside open and closing object tags and this way we can actually specify parameters and things this is a technique you use a few embed a YouTube video or real video something like that and basically with my mp4 is it just looks the same it's just another quick way to do that in this case instead of using the embed tag or the embed tag with the object tag you could generate an iframe and load a video into an iframe and we'll go over that later when we're talking about frames and iframes here our HTML comment tags comet tags were used to add comments to an HTML document that will not be displayed or processed when viewing a webpage but are visible in viewing the HTML source of a webpage these comment tags are useful to developers and programmers because they can put notes in their code but they won't be available or visible to the user when viewing the HTML document itself for example if I use two less than sign and then the exclamation point in a dash and then a dash on the greater than symbol any text I write inside of it is an HTML comment and you'll see it in the HTML source but you won't see it on the HTML page here are several examples and here are some HTML comment tags as an example and you can see by the way that NetBeans color codes it that this text here and this text will not actually display on the webpage it's here on the HTML source but not on the webpage so if we were to view it that won't show up and to illustrate that point all you see is HTML comment tags comment tags link Harry they captured Princess Zelda but if I look at the source here you can actually see the hidden comment tags that are only available in source view next we have the BR tag the BR tag instructs the carriage return our line feed into an HTML document each time you add the BR tag to your HTML service it causes text images and tables to drop down a line for example if we wrote line 1 and then the BR tag line 2 and then the BR tag and line 3 then line 1 and line 2 and line 3 would all be on separate lines see here in this HTML first that lines 1 2 3 4 & 5 will all be on separate lines however you can see that line 6 & 7 without BR tags will not and to illustrate that well 1 2 3 4 and then 5 and then without any more BR tags line 6 & 7 are on the same line as line 5 the next item we'll look at is the HTML Center tag the center tag Center is everything between its open and closing tags for example if I read the words Center me in between the open and closing Center tags then they would be centered in the middle of the page here's an example of text in between open and closing Center tags so all of this text would be centered on the page and to illustrate that as you can see this is n side of Center tags and this was outside of Center tags next is the HTML image tag used to image tag to load and display images on a web page some of the image tags attributes are source which specifies the location URL of the image alt which specifies alternate text and this shows up if the image doesn't or it can also be used as a pop-up or mouse over and some browsers border specifies the width of the image border so therefore zero would be no border name which sets the image name often used with JavaScript and cascading style sheets ID which sets the image ID heights and width used map which specifies the location URL of an image map which will map out certain areas of the image that you can click on as a hyperlink and then the align attribute which specifies the image alignment in relation to surrounding text and examples would be bottom top middle left and right in this example we're using several image tags and we're loading from a subdirectory called media underscore images zeldo one two and three jpg link one and two jpg and together jpg notice the width and the height have been set to the same and we also have alt tags so depend on the browser that you're using if you were to hold the mouse over the image this would be a mouse over or pop-up which would say Skyward Sword or if there's some reason people had images turned off when they were text only browsing then they would simply see Skyward Sword in this example here were placing a border around the image by setting border equals five let's see how that looks you another cool thing you can do with image tags is to use to use map attribute and so in this second example I have an image tag and the source is loading this image together dot jpg and I've doubled the width and Heights to 400 by 400 small border of two and it's gonna have an alt tag which if you look at an Internet Explorer would pop up as a little pop-up text now this attribute here used map is actually loading the image map okay so a little pound symbol and mads alt a fan map well here is mad Zelda fan map and it's notice an open and closing map tags we need to find an image map you can do it in one of three ways you can do it as a rectangle in which case you simply supply for arguments the starting X and starting y-coordinates and the ending X and ending y-coordinates you can do it as a circle in which case you supply two arguments the center coordinate and the radius size or you can do it as a polygon in which case you're going to supply a series of x and y coordinate pairs however many you need to complete and close the polygon well in this image map I'm just using rectangles and I threw a circle and a polygon in here just so you could see an example of how the argument lists would go feed it you know fed into the attribute Co RDS or chords for coordinates but here's the one I use most frequently which is rectangle and you can see that start out at X which moves this way 0 and y which moves down this way 0 so that's the top left-hand corner of the image and then go X 100 which is over this way where I'm moving the mouse cursor and go down 100 Y okay and then here I just start with a previous image finished and then I start again with the previous image finished now just to show you how these message map tags behave for image tag I'm going to load this in Firefox and if I load it in Firefox the image is there but the alt tags don't pop up but you'll notice if you look down here where I'm moving the mouse and the screen you'll notice how the URL changes let me get this stupid pop-up let's disappear all right there we go so you can see how the URL will change as I move them across the x-axis all right that's Firefox now I'm gonna load an internet explorer and actually Internet Explorer will show the alt tags so watch this as I move it across the x-axis it'll pop up and say save Princess Zelda and want you to URL down at the bottom there f1 underscore image tag of HTML well again look at the alt tag save Princess Zelda okay and then as I continue to move it it'll change to help link and then notice that the URL changes in the bottom left corner over here alright and then as I continue to move it it'll say rescue Midna and again notice help link was the alt tag and rescue Midna was to alt tag so there's two pop-up there or the alternate text and then finally when I leave the image map area it'll just show you the alt tag for the image tag the original image tag which was up here member this is the original image tag and it just said true love alright so let's test the hyperlink functionality of that and again a trough is in each of these three tags here inside of the map tags so if we test that out I click here notice it takes me to this page okay I'm gonna go back notice now there's like a little mask drawn around where the image map square was so I'm going to move over here and I'll click the second part of the image map then if it takes me here and now notice again a little mask is drawn around there and then I'm going to move over here and click on the third part of the image map okay next our HTML font tags the font tag sets the font face color and size of the text being displayed at an HTML document here are some examples and the first example we're setting the face to be comic sans ms the size to be four and the color to be red therefore the words hello nurse will be displayed in that font and that size and that color the next example we're using a font face of Arial a size of two and the color blue and therefore Animaniacs and between the font acts will be displayed with those attributes this is just an example of the same HTML document in this case utilizing font tags to change or modify the font so you can see here's my image tags and those are the same JPEGs that we showed in the previous example but here we're changing the font face to brush script a standard the size to six the color to paint for the princess allah we're changing the font face to bradley hand ITC size six color aqua for the hero link and then to bank gothic MD bt size five color gold for star-crossed lovers so again to see what that looks like in the web browser we'll load it up in Firefox and you can see here's what it looks like the next item will cover our HTML hyperlinks an AHF tag is used to create hyperlinks that take the user to another URL or location when the link is clicked for example if I put HTTP colon forward slash forward slash WWE network in programming comm and double quotes and place this inside of an a href statement inside of an opening anchor tag then add a closing anchor tag and then between the open and closing anchor tags type the word net proc when the user clicks the word net proc they'll be taken to the website or URL WWE network in programming comm in a second example if I were to do the same and say take WWE an of god place it in double quotes within an a HR F statement and an opening anchor tag then add a closing anchor tag and add the words rain of God in between the open and closing tags when they click on rain of God they'll be taken to the URL or web site WWE and com note the text between the AHS and a tags is what the user actually sees on the web page the URL in quotations after a href equals is where the user is sent to when the link is clicked so in other words they won't actually see the code AHS or anything concerning the URL just the word net Prague or rain of God okay this brings us to the hyperlink tag and it's a combination of an opening anchor tag and a closing anchor tag you can see how the NetBeans highlights that open and close an anchor tag sir and you use the attribute href in this case to specify the URL of a web site networking programming comm now all of this is invisible to the user so they're not going to see that part on the web page the only part they're gonna see is this you know this text right here networking programming and it'll be underlined but the code behind the page tells it that when they click on it the hyperlink is to take them to this URL this location this website okay and that's the way hyperlinks work so I can open and closing anchor tags the href attribute and here's an example of them you know taking them to a website that's a complete different URL or different website here's an example of just taking them to a single webpage that's on the same website you can do either way here is an example here of using a hyperlink or creating a hyperlink that uses the target attribute as well as HF and what that does is later when we cover frames we'll talk about how to use target but target new means to open it up and a brand new webpage and a new window sort of like when you right-click and you know Internet Explorer and you say open in a new window instead of open opening the page and the same window so that's the target attribute that that'll just give you kind of three different examples there of how to create a hyperlink or you know use the a href tag now again we're just using you know the same basic HTML tags HTML head body that we've already talked about font embeds or some music so let's see how that looks all right and so here if I click on this tag here takes us to the URL networking programming okay and if I click on this tag it takes us to a local web page you can see up here in the address bar and then if I click on this tag notice it opens up a new window so it's a new taggers the old page there's the new page that it loaded okay so you can see three different uses of the hyperlink next let's talk more specifically about HTML anchor tags now we've used anchor tags to create a hyperlink with the href attribute however the a name anchor tag is somewhat like the hyperlink tag the difference is that instead of taking the user to another URL locational and clicked anchor tags can take the user to a different place on the same web page designated by a name to do this first we would designate the section of the HTML document with an anchor name so in other words I'd have an opening anchor tag the attribute name and let's say that I specify the term Mountain then I'd put text and between the open and closing anchor tags in this example mountain poem next I create a hyperlink to the anchor that I just designated to do this I use another set of open and closing anchor tags and this time I used two href attribute and I was just specifying Mountain and then I'd put some text in between it say click here to read the mountain poem well when the user clicks that it will go and take them to the section of the HTML document that has been designated with the name Mountain you can also create a hyperlink to an anchor name located on a different page to do this just use the pound symbol in other words if I add an open and closing anchor tag and a href and I were to say poems that HTML the pound symbol Mountain then it would go to another page poems dot HTML and go down and find the designated name in an anchor tag of mountain when they click the link that said click here to read the mountain poem here's some HTML code that similar to our previous examples the same image tags but if you'll notice down here towards the bottom of the document I've added lots of BR techs and that'll add lots of line feeds or carriage returns to get on the page and then here I've created an anchor tag it's not a hyperlink because it's not a truss but it's just a name it says Twilight Princess so that's sort of the label and then right here after that I've embedded a video file in mp4 TP under squared minus-- story mp4 okay here's a bunch more BR tags so that'll drop it down you know quite a few more lines or carriage returns again not a hyperlink HF but just an anchor tag with name and a label and I've embedded another mp4 in this case Skyward underscore ending mp4 okay so that here I've set up the anchor tags with the name so to navigate to jump to a spot on the same page instead of going to another page like you would with a hyperlink in in this case all I have to do is use the href tag and then reference that was a pound symbol so a pound symbol Twilight Princess a pound symbol Skyward Sword and in this case it's going to go reference this name here on this link and this anchor tag here and this name here in this anchor tag here okay so just showing you how to use anchor tags to navigate on the same page whereas in the previous example you saw how to use hyperlink you know the href attribute an anchor tags to navigate to another page so let's see how that works we'll learn it up in Firefox okay and here's our page and if you see if you scroll down there's two videos way down here all right so they're towards the bottom of the page where they're playing so I'm gonna click the first one notice it takes me to this video on the same page still on the same page I haven't changed pages but look at the pound symbol there and the adjust bar I'm gonna go back now it takes me here to Skyrim swert again notice the pound symbol and the adjust part and as you can see these are on the same page now we have come to an HTML element known as the table HTML table tags provide a powerful and versatile means of formatting organizing and presenting information within an HTML document there are three sets of table text button closing table tags designate an HTML table open and closing TR tags designate a table row and open and closing TD tags designate a result or column let's delve into HTML table tags a bit further and look at the attributes that go with each tag set first look at attributes of the table tag the open and closing table tags are simply table and a forward slash and table some table tag attributes are border which sets the border width of the table BG color which sets the tables background color cell spacing which sets the spacing between the table cells cell padding which sets spacing between the cells border and its contents widths and Heights and then a line to set the tables horizontal alignment to left center or right here's an example of a table tag being used with some attributes there are attributes of the rio tag the open and closing red tags are TR and then /t are some red tag attributes are BG color which sets the rows background color width and height a line to set the rows horizontal alignment to left center or right and V align was just a vertical alignment of the table row possible values are top middle bottom and baseline here's an example of a table row tag with attributes finally our attributes of the salt tag the open and closing cell tags RTD and /td some cell tag attributes are bgcolor which sets the cells background color width and height a line which sets the cells horizontal alignment to left center or right vo line was just a vertical alignment of the table cell possible values are top middle bottom and B slang no rap which turns the word rapping on or off and the cell cost ban was that's the number of columns to sell will span and Rose Pham which sets the number of rows to sell will span here's an example of a cell tagged with attributes here is an example of a simple HTML table so first we have our opening table tag notice down here is our closing table tag so all the table code goes in between these tags and again as with any HTML tag you want to be very careful that you sandwich everything between the open and closing tags if you forget to close the tag you know or you get things out of sequence then you're gonna have all kinds of problems with the web page displaying properly are being interpreted properly by the web browser so let's look at the table tag here in this case it's gonna have a border and this gap of width 2 it's gonna have cell spacing - cell padding - it's gonna be aligned towards the center the background color will be purple and the width will be 600 okay and then let's count the rows and I've put comment tags in here so you can see but there's one row and there's another row there's the third row there's the fourth row there's the fifth row and here is the six six have a hard time saying that was th with sixth row okay so six rows and you can see the code and then let's go back and look at the cells so the rows are nested inside the table tags well just in the same way that the salt eggs are nested inside the red tags and so I've indented here so you can kind of see you know how they work together and how they fit together but in this case here's a single cell one salt and I've used to call span attribute to make it span three columns and if I didn't do that then when I wanted you know here I'm trying to create a row where there's just one cell but the text is centered and then beneath it will be another row that has three cells so if I didn't use cost around three then it wouldn't look right it would just put the text and you know the equivalent of the width of one cell so I have to use that here but down here I don't have to use it because I'm you know I'm adding three cells are three columns cells sort of synonymous with column Sam in this case first row is just one column but it takes two width of three columns hence the cost of an equals three the second row has three columns in it all right three cells the third row again just has one cell one column but it's you know it's three wide we're gonna make that one column three columns wide and that way it'll match up against the row four and row 2 which do have three cells are three columns and then again when they go down here's my next all inside of row five and once again you know I'm spanning it out to be the width of three columns even though it's only one column because there's only one set of salt acts TD tags and the row there and then I'm doing the same thing here so hopefully that will give you a good illustration of the usage of table tags and table row tags and cell tags TV tags and also of the usage of call span to cause a cell to you know to even out or to span out for multiple columns so you can make it look right and a table well that's the first table then I add a line and here's the second table and then this is just sort of a simple table but again I'm setting the border to cell spacing itself padding - and that's the width between the cells and between the text or the content that you put into cells aligning it to Center the background color is set the purple the width of 600 so it's the same what does the previous one but this one only has two rows and you can see the first row is once again just one cell or one column but it's going to span the width of three columns because I'm using the call span attribute there I'm gonna Center it and the font tag we're just modifying the font there then in the second row notice I have two cells alright so here's a cell and here's a soul and I'm just basically splitting that second row in half so let's see how that looks we'll see how it looks so clicking if I view the page just create two very simple tables and here's how they would look with everything displayed okay now let's take a look at another example real quick here and our second example we're doing something very similar but this time we're following the same pattern with the table tags and the table row tags and the table salt acts but this time instead of just plain text we're going to use our image tags we're going to put some JPEG files some graphics we're going to embed you know images and we're also going to end the second table were going to embed to mp4 so our videos and you can set border equals zero and make a table invisible and I'm setting to two here so you can see the table but a lot of webpages do that though you know here here in this example the first table I set the border to be zero so you can't see the table but still it gives you a great way to position and align things on a page so you could create a table with lots of cells you could make the border 0 and therefore make it invisible but then that gives you really good control over where you position things like graphics and texts because you can put that you know put it into different cells and it helps you line things up so just to show you what that looks like I'm going to display it here all right and so you know here's the first table and there's three columns or three cells and there's the first row their second row in this case you know I have to sell tags or two sets of cell types two columns third alright and then the text you know this is an you know it it's not separate row as well so I'll just count them all right so this is Row 1 this is Row 2 this is Row 3 the he relief Row 4 will be the two images currently the 5 would be the text are cross livers and their six and I'm gonna go ahead and stop that mp3 for now and then here's the second table and in this case we've embedded a couple of videos and there's the first song and the second song you can do this with YouTube videos all kinds of things whatever you want it to bit
