welcome to the 25th tutorial on beginning CSS today we're going to look at curving your borders and you do that with a radius property and so let's look at our web page and so what we'll do is we'll put this against our generic paragraph class that we create so we want to curve each one of these corners and so let's go ahead and do that and we'll open up our style sheet and here's our generic paragraph class that we created so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this in here and again it'll curve it by ten pixels so let's save this now I want you to open this up with Google Chrome if you have Google Chrome installed and you'll see here we've got these nice curved borders now now if we close this out and open this up in Internet Explorer you'll notice they're not curved and the reason is I wanted to point this out some of these rules don't work with the older versions of ie so I have ie eight now if you have a later version of Internet Explorer it might be fine but I eight didn't support this rule so just be aware that some of the older releases do not support some of the CSS properties so again if we open this back up in chrome we can see it works fine because I have the latest version of Chrome installed on this computer and now of course we see the property is applied so we'll use Chrome throughout the rest of this video and if you have a later version of ie Explorer you can certainly go ahead and open it up with IE 9 or 10 and this property should work just fine now what I want to also show you now is that you can also add curvature just select corners so for instance we can do border bottom left this won't be curved but if we do the border top left side and put 10 pixels in here it will be curved so this is a way for you to specifically specify which corners you want curved so let's go ahead and copy and paste all these rules in here and I'll show you how this works so let's save this let's open it up in Google Chrome and there you can see we've only got the two top corners curved if we wanted to curved the bottom corners we could just add ten pixels so you see how that works now let's go ahead and actually curve all the corners so we'll put this property back in there and save it and we'll open it back up with chrome and there you can see we're back to normal okay let's close that out these only work against the corners these properties if you want to work against a specific side you can also do that and you can do that against the style the width and the color so let's pick a style for instance let's say let's put in here border bottom - style and we'll do dotted so now we're just going to say we only want the bottom dotted and so let's go to our style sheet and you can see here the style we were applying was solid so it's a planet of course - all the sides but here we'll just say we want the bottom dotted so if we save this and go down here you can see now just the bottom is dotted so that's how that works and actually open that up and Internet Explorer let's actually open that up in chrome so we can see the curvature and there you can see we've got the bottom dotted so that's how that worked and again like I said you can also do that with width and color so let's actually change this to red and we'll put in color and now the bottom should be painted in red so we'll open this up again in Google Chrome and you can see we've got a red bottom so feel free to play around with these and I will see you guys in the next video
