we need to create hyperlinks there are some situations where you need to navigate from one section to the another section in the same page then also we need to create hyperlinks so there are two situations where you need to create hyperlinks either to navigate from one page to another page our navigate from one section to another section in the same page a hyperlink can be a text or image or any section in your web page to create hyperlinks in HTML we use anchor tag that is a tag a tag is a paid tag and it is an inline tag it has one of the important attribute that is called as hyperlink reference hyperlink reference accepts a value that is page to which you want to navigate so let's get started I have here first page dot HTML page to navigate from one page to another page of course I need one more page so I go to start run I open notepad in this notepad I am going to create the HTML structure closing HTML we know that HTML is divided into two section one is head and another one is body in this head section I am going to put the title TI tle title closing TI tle title file save as I save this a desktop with the name as s-e-c Bo and the second page dot HTML I put both side double quotations so that it should get save as webpage so here we have first page dot HTML here we have second page dot HTML right click open with the notepad here I give the title as f irst first page here I say f irst first page or I can simply say here welcome to first page file save similarly I am going to create the second page I open the second page with notepad here I say s-e-c bow and the second page then in the body section I say welcome to se C bow and the second page file save now we have two pages one has the content welcome to first page you can see that and another one we have is second
