alright guys welcome to your 29th html5 tutorial and in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is we're going to be styling through CSS the look of the video player so we're not going to be making it work or anything like that but we're going to be making it look awfully pretty so the very first thing we need to do is since we said okay we're linking to a CSS file we probably should go ahead and make that file right now so go ahead and hit file new and save this as main I think I called it main dot CSS oh where are your buddy cascading style sheet and save that baby so now the very first thing we want to do is we need to use those skills this dumb stupid cord for my headphones keeps getting in the way so go ahead and hit body and we want to Center this bad boy so text align center and that's just going to center our video player now I know that I don't have you know a header a footer article or any of that crap but what I like to do whenever I'm working with anything html5 tags like section or nav I like to go ahead and just include everything because then if I add anything later on then I'll be good to go so header let's see if I can remember them all section footer aside oh that's he is in F what are they article and H group I got a feeling I'm forgetting like two of them but that'll be good for now so what I want to do is I want to take all of these in this flame is a block because remember some things are not blocked by default so I just want to get everything on the same page um I've got an itch on my head embarrassing so now what do we have next now that we got all our housekeeping stuff done we can go ahead and start styling this baby now remember our video in our nav player pretty much make up our entire movie player and that's why I surrounded everything in something called a skin now if you've ever downloaded like a bunch of a legal arm you know like Kaza Napster they have these a lot different skins are like different fields or like different layouts you can like a forest theme or like a Barbie theme which I tend to prefer but a skin is pretty much the overall look of your video player so remember this entire thing was surrounded in a section called skin an idee skin so let's go ahead and style that baby now so skin anytime we have something in the skin let's go ahead and first thing we need to do is set the width of the layout so remember our video is 640 pixels wide so of course our skin it needs to be a little bit wider than that since our video is going to fit inside it so I'm just going to go ahead and hit 700 pixels whatever your video is make it like 50 pixels wider or somewhere around then it doesn't it can be like 50-100 whatever you want just make sure it's wider than your video next I'm going to give it a margin because by default this is pressed right up against the top of the screen and I want to but it down about 10 pixels just so you know it looks a little prettier so 10 pixels Auto is going to move it down 10 pixels from the top of our website and after this I want to give it a padding now if you put your video right in your skin then there's going to be no space between your video in the background so what we want is a padding so you know we want a little bit of separation or else oh it's going to look funny so padding of about 5 pixels is going to give us a nice border around our video and we also want the background to be red now I typically don't like your red because it's a really weird color but whenever you're teaching these things on YouTube it's going to be really easy to see a nice bright red background so after this we need a border and this is going to be the border around the skin or around the video player and I'm just going to put my like 4 pics solid black and you typically only want it one or two pixels bug in for demonstration purposes I want a nice thick black border so the very next thing I want to add is I want to give this thing rounded corners now actually I'm not sure if you need the WebKit for this if I just put border-radius I think that that is standard right now so this should go ahead and give it rounded corners without adding WebKit actually let me go ahead and refresh this and see yup there you go so by the way there's a little tip anytime you use border-radius you can just use that you don't need WebKit or anything and like I said we have a width of 700 pixels a margin of 10 what that does is it just moves it 10 pixels from this line to this line and let's see what else the padding is pretty much the space between the video in the border this nice little red line because I didn't want it to butt up right against there on the background of red the border is of course solid black and the border radius just gives it nice round corners so now that are pretty much overall skin is taken care of we can go ahead and move on to the next section now under our skin we have our video which we don't need to take care of because you know that's just their video we can't really change it and lets me film a new video and we have our navigation bar now the navigation bar has our play button in it which is right there and it also has our progress bar which isn't shown up because we didn't make one yet so let's go ahead and the very first thing we need to do is make some overall settings for this navigation so I'm going to go ahead and hit nav and I'm going to give it an overall margin just because I want this nav to kind of separate from the video I don't want to bunched up I'm going to give it a margin of 5 pixels zero pixels and this is just going to you know give it a little bit of spacing on top and bottom so after this what do we have after this the buttons now I have a div tag right here and I called it buttons but the truth is there's only one button inside here I just named it buttons because if I ever decide to make more buttons later on maybe I want stop on or forward rewind button I can add those buttons but now I only have one button so you know I didn't want to mislead you guys so let's go ahead and style those buttons section right now so I'm going to make an ID and I'm going to call it buttons and in here the first rule I want to make is float:left now on all the video players you too boob I'm just going to use YouTube is my standard the play button and pause button they're all on the left hand side and this is how they achieve that float:left now after this I need to give a set width for those buttons or for the buttons section and that's because I'm going to give a set width for the progress bar and you need to define widths because when you're making calculations later on you need to know the width of these things so with I'm just going to make it like 70 pixels anything from like 5200 should be fine and I'm going to go ahead and give it a default height too so I'm going to give it a height of 20 to pixels and that should be pretty good so now let's go ahead and save this in refresh it and see what it looks like we got our play button which has a little bit of spacing on the top and bottom it's floated to the left and even though you can't see it has a width of 70 and the height of 22 and right here on this section right here is where our progress bars are going to go or whenever the video plays you can see a little thing that's going to move as the video starts and stops and you can also are going to be able to click that and move the video around but we have to program all that but before we get to the programming we actually have to make it in CSS and I'm going to be showing you guys how to make that and it's going to be absolutely amazing and then I'm going to show you guys how to program it so anyways enough of me talking about what I'm going to do I'm just going to end the video and then the next video you guys can follow along with me so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
