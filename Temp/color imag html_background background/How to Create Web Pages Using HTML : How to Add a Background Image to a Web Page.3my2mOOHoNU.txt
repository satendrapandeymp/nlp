hello my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a software developer in this video I will show you how to add a background image to a web page let's start with the basic HTML file go to the body tag and specify a new background attribute this attribute specifies a background image for the entire HTML page if the image is smaller than the browser the image will be repeated until it fills the entire browser window the value of this attribute is the location or URL of the image you want to use the URL can be an absolute value which means that it has the entire path or a relative URL which means that it depends on the location of the current page for example let's use an image inside the same directory as the HTML file to fill the background here we have an image called back dot jpg type the name of the image in the source file save the file and see the changes in the browser if you want to use an absolute path you have to write the entire URL in order to get the absolute path of an image on the web you can right click on it then select properties and copy the location of the file paste this location in the source file save it and refresh the page I'm Luis Estrada and I've just shown you how to create web pages using HTML
