you hi guys welcome to nation acknowledges this is Subaru we'll see another video session on HTML table tag generally we are using table tag to display the data in perfect a tabular format table tag is very useful to align the data or to align any kind of image graphics any kind perfect alignment we required means commonly we are using table tag and tables are used to represent our data in tabular format as I said already the best way to split a page into different sections using tables it is a paid tag syntax and just outline I am showing to you they will open table close the paid tag horizontal lines which are present in the table is called table rows generally in table tag we are writing TR using PR tag we are displaying table rows to represent the table rows inside the table tag PR we are using it is a pager tag and outlines uses I provided a very simple table open table clothes inside table row and this table row inside again I want to write that is table data we are calling here specially columns not available and that is table data is nothing but cells these cells are represented by TD TD also a paid tag it is representing table data so table data syntax TD open TD close and when we are observing outlines of that example simply outline a provided table tag information level table TR TD like this hierarchy available the hierarchy one example I will develop and I will show you first so you'll get one perfect ID on that so first I am writing table tag table tag inside body tag inside I am implementing and table open table close TR TR inside TD and TD again the same table row on table that I am going to copy paste here and table data EMP ID EMP name ID I am providing 1 0 0 1 nowadays technologies ID 1 0 0 2 providing my name and I didn't use any kind of attributes here just a plain table I want to show you on the web page refresh employee ID employee name and the related rows available once you are coming back what are the attributes we need to apply TR I said already TD I said but there is no difference between data and heading all are looking like same you want to make sure separate that th table heading we are using th table heading again your also th table heading save it and refresh you can see the difference so that is heading this is data now table heading also completed I require a title we are using title purpose caption I am giving employee details title I am providing caption I am closing and refresh on the webpage perfectly coming on the top of that and eva browser but table is not visible here because you didn't apply any kind of attribute on your table what are attributes available first we'll observe list of attributes related to table type is a big list of attributes existed here one by one all the attributes we can observe these many attributes are waiting to do practically on the webpages border pixels border a color any color name or color code BG color any color or color code background image path height pixels or percentage with the pixels or percentage align left to right the center we align vertical align top middle bottom rules rows columns none and all by default is none cell spacing cell padding rowspan call span so these all attributes we'll cover in this video session every example will understand very clearly on table tag so right now I am implementing border come back to our source code open the border table tag level just right border is equal to 1 pixel thickness come back and refresh perfect observe correctly the table it is not perfect the table in HTML table means not the collection of rows and columns collection of cells now cells available all are those cells perfectly aligned that is a reason these are looks like rows and columns but if you are observing correctly no row no column can we display rows and columns definitely using rules attribute we can display now border 1 pixel completed and you can observe the title also perfectly title center available table Center for example Center perfectly available or not other browser also we can see is his Firefox now I am coming by the same caption caption means writing cut it I'm taking two bottom of the table refresh save it and refresh not changed another browser not changed by default table caption displays on top of the table always you need to remember the point you write inside the source code captured in bottom or top it displays always on top that is caption duty now once the caption we completed now remaining border already read it next one border color border color is equal to hash ff0000 and available now I want to refresh that border color perfectly whatever the color I applied clearly visible to you now next one is BG color is equal to color name also you can write directly yes save it and refresh and I want to display one image background that is background is equal to the image path I am providing any image path you can provide chrome dot PNG I said come back and refresh small images means better if big image you provide it means maybe visibility available completely not visibility while that time you can apply width and height attributes so if you are applying width and height attributes it will be now I am giving width is equal to one five zero pixels right refresh on the web page and again height I want I to is equal to 100 pixels and height I am providing hundred pixels save it so image also now you can change as for example HTML 5.2 pi PNG refresh but a complete image is not visible back said observe maybe that is not transparent that is a reason upper one also disturbing but in the real-time industry those images we are developing as per our compatible no issue first the image coming or not you can check it now this is whatever you provided the path this is the global path as I said in the earlier video session - I made a local path file path web related paths also we can apply so this is completely related to background now background width height next we need to work on align V align align horizontally V align vertically rules I said in HTML table table means not a rows and columns here collection of cells you want to see rows and columns use a rules attribute first we'll finish off then I'll come back to align and V aligned so rules attribute using rules attribute we can able to display perfectly table rules supporting four parameters one rows second calls third all fourth none practically we can observe it remove all attributes write refresh on the webpage that is and whatever border available border also I am removing direct only skelton table Skelton available yes perfect now other browser also readily available is perfect both are perfectly executed now I am coming to source code I said rules equal to rows save it refresh rules equal to rows and refresh here also rules equal to rows now rules equal to calls and refresh again columns refresh rules is equal to calls available as well as rules is equal to rows available only columns visible column type roast him only rows visible now come back to now already caption related information completed and now refresh now refresh perfect visibility is there now rules all means the rows and columns come back to table tag say all now rows visible as well as columns visible now border is not there because water we didn't mention anything now I am writing border attribute border is equal to in the table tag level border is equal to 1 pixel save it and refresh perfect the table visible to you it is a royal table so when you are implementing rules attribute we can apply perfect rows as well as columns now after rules attribute we can observe cell spacing cell padding after that align we align we can see what is cell spacing it always representing distance between cells for example rules I am removing here perfect understanding purpose once again I add just a minute I'm removing coming to browser execute so as our group of cells came now cell to cell between space is very less available I want to increase the space now that time I am writing cell spacing cell spacing is equal to I am saying 10 pixels come and refresh your cellspacing so whenever cellspacing available here 10 pixels by default to 1 to 2 pixels come back and I said 20 pixels now inside the data very close to my margin now I need some more space that is called cell padding cell padding means the distance between existing text and the edge of the cell is called cell padding this is padding whatever the gap you are observing here I need more gap then come back and run that cell padding cell padding is equal to 10 pixels I made save it run it observe now cell padding distance between text and the edge of the cell is called cell padding so cell padding succeded cell spacing also succeeded now I am going to remaining four attributes aligned horizontally V align vertically row span working on columns call span working on rows first we will observe call span because it is working on rows what is call spend definition wise will observe the call span once and call span related information also I am showing call span the row span these two features allows you to extend columns and rows across multiple other columns and rows call span it extends the cells horizontal as I said already rows wise and call span is equal to number we are providing right now the same call span I am implementing on my example try to remove whatever cell spacing cell padding available already we are very clear regarding that I am refreshing my web page clear now concentrate one call span a row span now I am doing here call span come down and nourish technologies only I want to visible completely remove that and I am applying how many available year columns call span equal to two available yes perfect and if you are running how it is merging observe by default alignment is left side for example you need align Center align attribute we are using your Center refresh that is technologies now you added another column for example th I'm going to copy paste Here I am saying salary salary column I said same here also we require another one user having salary TD and nourish technologies having and $10,000 I made feeding data same PD that I required case Raju also for example I am doing here $6,000 now once you refresh that observe only those two whatever one column extracted those two cells available but it is a just earlier on it is not reflected that you need to reflect that one also and you can use here three and remove this then it is adjusting that so this is called span working on rows here align attribute suitable now you want to align Eris technologies right side yes you can go there and say simply right RI ght now refresh so I am coming to now next one a row span rowspan always working on columns same like this come down those paths it extends the cells on your vertical row your via line working it also rowspan is equal to working on number now simply without modifying my previous one this one all I am taking directly I'm going to copy paste because no need to modify whatever available no formalities directly body section body inside I am going to paste that right table tag available here and border I required one pixel enough for me by default pixel if you didn't right also no border nothing nothing vertical or doesn't require for me just a director refresh yes on that one columns now it is a central viable by default align is left available by default vln center available i required for example top so then I am writing V align V align is equal to top save it and refresh so these many attributes I shown to you on your table tag once again what are the list of the attributes we observed from starting onwards let me recall one by one these attributes border pixels border color any color name you can use color code BG color background height width even you can apply it TR level means a table row level also we can apply table deck a level also we can apply but border only table level water color only table level BG color table level as well as cell level background table level as well as cell level height of it the table level cell level table row level also width same online via line just now I shown to you already aligned working with the call span via line working with the row span and rules available rows columns I shown to you already cell spacing spacing between cells cell padding the distance between text and observe the cell row span call span row working based on columns column working based on rows so this is complete to total table tag related attributes here @p header/footer tbody like this other options also available in upcoming videos more in depth we can see
