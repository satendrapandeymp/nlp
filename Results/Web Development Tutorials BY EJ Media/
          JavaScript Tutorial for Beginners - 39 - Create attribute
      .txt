in this video we're going to add an attribute node now in the last two videos we've added HTML element nodes and we've added text nodes of course but there is a third big one and I like to call these the big three element nodes text nodes and attribute notes so again in this video we're going to add an attribute node now if we click on this button here are the two elements we've created along with the text node so what we want to do is add a attribute node to this paragraph that we've added here and so what we want to do is let's just do something simple we'll just change the text to blue we're not really interested in the CSS styling that we're going to be adding we're just interested in the concept of adding an attribute node so let's first just create a little CSS rule for this create an ID selector in our CSS code so that when we do add our attribute no this will be changed automatically so let's go ahead and flip to our stylesheet and we'll just come down here and I've already typed out the code and pretty simple here right you know by now that with an ID selector we use the pound sign and we're just going to call this test and we're just going to change the color of that text dark blue okay so let's head over to our JavaScript code and the good thing is we've already created the element right here right so we don't have to use a get elements by tag because we've already got our paragraph element right so we can just reuse this element object a little bit later so again we've created the element we've created a text node and right down here we're going to add the attribute so I'll just copy and paste the first line here and explain it so we're going to create a variable called P attribute and we're going to use of course the document object and here is the new method create attribute and that will give us our attribute node now right here you can put any type of HTML attribute you want here we could create a source attribute we could create an href attribute we could create a language attribute any HTML attribute we want to create we just call it by its regular name and so if it was a class we would put class here but since we're creating ID all we have to do is put an ID here that's it that's all that gets passed into this method now what we want to do is assign a value to this ID and of course we want to use the value that we placed in our CSS stylesheet which of course was test that's going to be the name of our ID so we do that by using the value property and I'll show you that right now so I'll just copy and paste this in here so we've got our object now and so value is just a property that we can use to set the value pretty simple to test and so again that's fairly easy to understand now what we need to do is reuse our element object right so we're going to type in element and then we use the set attribute node method and we're just going to pass in our P attribute object that holds our ID of test so we'll just put that right in here and there we go so let's go ahead and save everything up and we'll go ahead and run our webpage and let's see what we get here and there you go we created our paragraph element and it now has an attribute node and of course using that ID in CSS we set the text to blue now again if we wanted to grab one of these existing paragraphs we would probably use the method get elements by tag or something like that and then add an ID to that tag but like I said we didn't have to because we already created the paragraph node in the element object so we could just reuse that now one question you might be asking so let's close this out and go back to the JavaScript code you might be asking well wait a minute now you created an element up here and then you appended the child and you created a text node up here and you appended the child we created an attribute node with this method and you you didn't append the child why didn't you do that you set the attribute node and there is a reason for that and I was confused by this for a little while until I was unconfused let's just pull up the document object model representation of this web page and if you take a look at that here's all of our h1 h2 s paragraphs and here's the last one the paragraph node that we created along with the text node and here's the attribute node now the reason we didn't use the appendchild is because the attribute node is technically not a child it's actually part of the element so when you see these document object models you always see the attributes side phase two the HTML element that's because it's part of it an HTML attribute is technically not a child of the paragraph element again it is part of it so that's why we didn't use the append child okay I will see you guys in the next video
