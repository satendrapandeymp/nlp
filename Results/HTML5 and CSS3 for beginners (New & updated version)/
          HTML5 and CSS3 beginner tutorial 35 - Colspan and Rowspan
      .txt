hey YouTube how's it going it's Clinton here and welcome to tutorial number I think this is 35 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit more about tables so we started off in the previous tutorial just creating this really basic table which has three rows and three columns right so that's what the table pretty much looked like in the end and I want to show you guys a few more things that you can do with tables in and then in the next video we'll take a look at styling the table with some CSS so let's go ahead and just modify this table a little bit because I want to show you guys something called colspan and rowspan so colspan means that we can take one column or one cell like this and make it span over two columns or actually you could make it span over many more right so let's jump back over here into our code and i'm going to under person's name or on the p h4 person's name I'm going to add an attribute here called colspan and I'm going to make that span over two so whatever value you put in here is the number of columns that this cell will span over right and then what I'd like to do is maybe take the surname out of this table data and I'm going to place it in a new cell so let's create a new cell or a new table data over here and we'll do the same thing with the next person right oops don't forget to add the table data's right so save this now and if you jump back over to the browser and hit refresh you will see that basically what this does is this colspan attribute makes this cell span over two columns and then what I did was I added an extra column to each one of these table data or to each one of these bottom rows so this one has three columns but these ones have four columns and that way it means that this table data spans over two columns basically so it's fans of a Quinton the first name and what the second name and the same thing for Shaun and Puli first and second names right so if you guys wanted to split data up like that you could do that using colspan you can also use something called row span so let's say for instance Quinton had two nationalities so yet one nationality which is South African but he had another nationality which was German or something right then I don't want to repeat the same data over again I don't want to repeat Quinton what the same name but I do want to have a different nationality over here so let's say German or I don't know just because I'm learning German that was why I popped into my head right and let's get rid of these two cells and now for Quinton and the surname what we can actually go in here and add a row span of two and then another one of row span two and that'll make Quinton wats span over two rows so let's come back here and hit refresh and now you can see that my name Quinton what spanned over two rows instead of just one row like it used to before so you can have basically one row span over multiple rows or one cell in a row span over multiple rows all right and the great thing about this is you can have as many rows spans and Col spans as you like so just go ahead and increase the number you can see I just threw the table off a little bit but yeah if you want to add whatever value you want to put in here that's why many rows is going to span over so now Quinton wants spans over three rows but unfortunately what we did was we threw this information of so to get it looking neat and tidy again we might have to just remove Sean from the database or Sean from the code and now we have it looking a little bit better again so yeah just keep that in mind when using row span and colspan if you span over too many columns or too many rows are you going to throw your table out and it's going to look a little bit weird but yeah otherwise it pretty much that's that's how it works is pretty simple I'm just going back if you think maybe put those rows bands back in right so something else I want to show you guys whoops something else I want to show you guys is something called a table caption so tables have this caption tag which you typically put right here underneath the opening table tag and before your first row you'll add a caption and then this can say pretty much anything you want it to like personal data and this caption basically just explains what's going to be in the table so that users kind of know what what information they're looking at in the table right so let's come back in and hit refresh and you can see that now we have our caption displaying above the table like that and yeah it's it's pretty clear that this table obviously contains information about someone's personal data or personal information right so that's captions there are other elements that tables have such as a table body so you can under your first row or around your first row create a tea head tag and maybe just put that below with the heading ends so now this is our heading and that's why it's surrounded by the tea head tag whoopsie that was a blank CSS file by the way right so that's just this table hitting and the only reason why you would do that is if you want to do specifically style your table hitting different keys so if we save this right now and come back over the browser and refresh nothing actually changes this tag doesn't change the appearance of the table at all in any way until you use CSS to style it so we might look at that in the next tutorial maybe styling the heading a little bit differently to the rest of the table then you also get because you have T head for table head you also have P T body right and obviously you want to maybe move that closing tag to the bottom of the table and then you also have something called the table foot or T foot which at the end of your table you might want to just place one row in there and have it span over over all of the columns so you might take one just have one table data in there and have it span colspan off three columns and you just say and the table whatever don't even worry about spelling it right now okay okay that's four columns now so just make sure you adjust that to fit the rest of the table and there we go right so that's that's our table looking a little more like a table just kind of doesn't look very nice right so in the next video we're going to take a look at actually styling this table may be making alternate rows change color or something like that and I'll see you guys in that video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that thank you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute $5 or more on patreon and I really appreciate that what you still hear there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
