[Music] hi guys welcome to narrator technologies this is abrazo in this video session we can view math ml mathematical markup language HTML 5 math ml it is exclusively developed on XML namespaces it is not related to any Java scripting it is a pure saggital kind of things now math ml markup language the markup language specially designed for mathematics in XML already doesn't for describing mathematical notations the main aim of math ml is display mathematical formulas equations and the solutions effectively on webpages it was implemented in the era of 1998 it is not a direct html5 feature it is one of the organizations which is joined in html5 group so XML syntax a means of your math ml XML syntax also differently available how means XML namespace HTTP route website w3c dot o-r-g and 1998 year whatever the group implemented math group and a matter malai Barry that I will show you practically but before that some versions are viola billion one two three latest version is a 3.0 it is released 2010 that is a last now once we are entering into namespace information I provided here and what is the syntax let me write physically that now I am implementing for example math it is a page attack open available closed also is there now once namespace you are going to be name space equal to http ww.topdentistsonline.com RG 1998 math group implemented math ml concept that is even Kappa letters even small letters also no issue just you can try to copy this complete namespace come to your browser just a replace that means of paste in your address bar try to check it directly it is going to the related math ml namespace perfectly split math ml namespace and different different URLs available washings available whichever the version you required just click on that it is going to the next page of that version related components once it is going there and it has number of elements inside that and it is giving table of contents also they will display and if you come down all the way table of contents available so these topics mail I am going to discuss with you guys in this video session we can view all these all these shapes and formulas also but before that one what are the features of math ml linking directionality line breaking including images also different formulas routes square roots and it is a part of now HTML file like this a number of features are there and how to present they were math ml presentation of math ml completely related to 30 plus tags available these are 30 plus attacks every tag starting with M M represents a maths so you need to remember that whatever the tags existed here yeah my mathematical identifies mo mathematical operators MN mathematical numbers M takes mathematical takes non zero and mathematical horizontal rows and M superscript and M subscript also available M fractions like this every tag starting with M so M represents mathematics now we can view some examples here first initially I am showing to you some examples like same doctype we need to use commonly doctype HTML and body section inside body opened body close then inside existed methanol methanol inside am writing M sub means mathematical superscript now once you are going to close it inside a my mathematical identifier now if you are going to close this mathematical number and MN I am saying now once you are going to mathematical number M sub inside now you can refresh the browser excellent it is an X cube so displayed of M sub now again the same M sub I'm taking for example I want to implement mathematical operator plus I want to implement that inside for example I want to write another M sub then if I am going to run this it is giving invalid markup whatever the hierarchy you followed that is not correct because every operator you need to write out of the subscript or superscript now whatever operator we implemented that you can take now close this this is one m sub completed now plus now why we want write y cube we are going to be and once we are going to why that now M sub I required once again here keep once again M sub two times close one time n of Y cube right perfect example are not we can see perfect like this simple implementation we need to do and a browser providing concerned related info mission if you are writing any mistake in the hierarchy now come down I want to see this total hierarchy in a row format and commonly we are using mathematical row this is only we are calling horizontal rows we are calling commonly what is the horizontal row we can write as if / now is equal to means mo chedda cube so I think you people got an idea already how to implement M sub same we can go to subscript superscript of time giving subscript M sub now I am giving X to the base 10 minus y to the base 10 and I am giving again subscript again subscript now I am going to refresh that perfect so these are called subscript the base superscript power level displayed now here M sub sub calls available means together we can work subscript as well as superscript also we can able to work now after this some square root kind of mathematical equations existence so what are the square root of mathematical equations we can see see root and these root what exactly the meaning of M root ok practically we can see them root element is used to display roots with an explicit index two arguments are accepted okay we'll see that M root M root close now if I am going to take this M root right completely you can remove whatever we implemented in the previous example M are double Votey root and close em root once we close that now I am giving inside M i mathematical identifier again am I closed now if I am going to implement mathematical numbers and I am saying is MN MN ok mathematical number representing now you are coming and executing you cube root X another perfect on like this for example you want to display cube root Y again you are taking this and less fo operator and already previous example to mention to you right M root for example you are giving here cube root X and the cube root Y is of it like this simply perfectly we can able to implement these are the mathematical equations implementing by using mathematical markup language it is exclusively for the mathematical equations now if you are coming to the other one so now we can see so M square roots available okay now for example I am removing this whatever extra things available now I am coming to square root now you are removing this MN and you are thinking now only root X will be displayed in valid markup why means synthetically we made mistake already here come back and we'll observe that what mistake we did M root is not good for this one that time we are using M square root M square root there is a tag existed and M square root tag existed now now once M square root you modified come and run that effect simply you are changing the hierarchy problem already made that very clearly static example time only so this is another simple right come back to another example we can see M enclose a beautiful tag is there element renders its content inside an enclosing notation specified by the notation attribute so M enclose supporting one notation attribute by using notation attribute we can perform these many values we can perform at least a few we can tie it right come back to that notation attribute and first M and close only M enclose mn close and Emin close again we need to close that inside we can implement some numbers mathematical numbers we can see our mathematical identifies also no problem mn close em i mathematical identifier again mi mathematical identifier closed now same thing why I am giving that right so these are the two things available here in between I am using one Operator also mo plus M mathematical operator so now if you are going to use notation there is a notation attribute available notation is the equal to what are the values existed we can say notation attribute having box first we can see what is that box right and refresh the browser right and refresh the browser and we can see that things whatever existed here come back and refresh so once we are going to write flash box displayed X plus y plus y displayed again next available rounded box come back and execute like this at different different parameters available why don't you try you people circle and other things also available this is box okay now for example you can go back to circle now I am providing that circle now come back to you world now it is displaying circuit like this is different different mathematical notations we can able to display guys right and we can see some more tags here and available fractions M frac it is going to display the fractions how simply we can able to develop that right M fractions M frac flag and close em frac opened one once you are going to close that inside we can open mathematical identifier a my ex again you can close mathematical identifier copy that paste here and I said why I hope you understood what exactly output is now it is coming X by Y now for example I want to display X by Y by a by B definitely we can so now I am taking this a and by B definitely comes but the meaning may be differently available yes now I want X by Y whole by a by B that time there is an attribute available the attributed name is nothing but B but you need to write hole by means another m fact inside you need to develop B weld is equal to true and the M fact you need to close ending and it is providing information here just and refresh hole by like this mathematical M fractions we can able to develop so all these are basic levels just mathematical formulas I shown to you for example you want to go to develop a square plus B square is equal to C square otherwise minus B plus or minus root of B Square minus 4 AC by 2 a like this a big big equations also we can able to implement for example purpose just a small example I am showing to you recently which ever I implemented a square so recently developed one I am showing to you these are a very simple one and only the information purpose I am passing in the next video session in detail we can observe only what satisfaction purpose yes I implemented like this so like this equations also possible all these are nothing but math ml kind of power so this is a best feature thank you for watching my videos for more videos please log on youtube.com slash narration T [Music]
