hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 39 and in this tutorial we're gonna take a look at a few other input elements that you can use in the browser or in HTML and yeah to get started with this tutorial I've gone ahead and cleared out all the other code that was in our form so now we have just a form and an input element of type submit' so that's our input submit button and if you look at that in the browser so let's look at Firefox this is pretty much what it looks like in fact of course you guys will see it like this when it's zoomed out so that buttons all small and stuff but I'm just zooming in a little bit so that you guys can see very clearly what's going on here and for the purpose of this tutorial I'm also going to be using Google Chrome because I just want to show you guys where certain input elements might look a little bit different and also yeah basically there's some input elements that were going to look at that is supported by Chrome but are not really supported by Firefox and yeah that's the reason why I'm using two browsers in this video so let's go ahead and start by looking at the input element of type submit' or type file sorry so let's get a little type in input and I'm gonna give it a type of file and I'm gonna give it a name of file upload or something right so whatever you're expecting the user to upload with this input element you can go ahead and just put that as the name and then I want to put in a double break tag just to space everything out a little bit better right so let's save come back over to the browser and refresh and now you can see in Firefox we have our submit or not our submit button bar file upload button over here and the great thing about this is you can click on it and it's gonna open a little window where you can then select a file that you want to upload to the server or to the website hit open and yeah the name is gonna appear there right but this doesn't automatically upload a file to the server when I click Submit you can see it goes through to login dot PHP which is our action over here on the form right so whatever action you put in there that's where it's going to take you and hopefully this file whatever this file is has some smart PHP code that allows the user to upload and save the file if not yeah then that data is kind of lost right and yeah we haven't learned about PHP just yet so we'll learn about that in future okay anyway so now we've taken a look at the file submit there are a few other options that we can look at one of those input one of the other types of inputs that we can take a look at is something called an email input and this is new to html5 so some of the elements that I have most of the elements that I've shown you have been around in HTML for a really long time but some of the elements that I'm going to be talking about now have only been around since html5 so they're fairly new and some browsers support them other browsers don't support them it just depends on what browser you're using most of the good browsers do but yeah you'll see in certain cases oh why I have chrome open here as well all right so let's go over to the input type of the second input and change that to email and then for the name we can also just set that to email right and if we save this and jump back over to the browser you can see what we have what looks like an empty text box it's probably better if I place a placeholder in here just to make that tell us what we're needing to put in there right and now you'll see if I type in James just a name James or whatever you want it to type in you'll see that when I click out of that text box or that email box we now have a red line around the element and if I hit submit the browser won't let this form submit without a valid email address so right now this is just a person's name it's not an email address the browser automatically knows that because of this type being set to email and so this is something that like like I said it's new to html5 if these elements were not around before but basically it automatically validates an email so you don't have to use PHP or JavaScript to do it for yourself although it's still recommended that you check on the server with PHP if it is an actual valid email but let's type in a valid email here so James ATS email comm right now if we go out of this box you can see that we don't have an error and I can actually submit this form because this is a valid email address the email address might not actually exist but we do have a name we do have an @ symbol and we do have a domain at something.com or add something dot c @ @ za or whatever it is so the browser knows that this looks like an or like a valid email so we'll go ahead and let the user submit the form right so now we've gone ahead and looked at email let's look at the next one I want to show you guys which is telephone number and so this is not going to look very different in the browser at all if we refresh you can see that this just looks like a normal text box and even if we type letters in here it lets us type the letters and it's not automatically validating anything but the nice thing about this one is it will if you open it on your phone give you a keyboard that has numbers only so instead of popping up with the entire QWERTY keyboard it just pops up with the numbers 0 to 9 a hash symbol and a star symbol or whatever and basically that the same keyboard that you have when you're phoning somebody is the same keyboard it gives you when you want to fill in a telephone number so basically users who are on their phone will find it a lot easier to place a telephone number in this input element because they can only select numbers right so that is telephone by the way I should have changed that name to telephone not that it matters now anyway right the next element I want to show you guys is going to be the month element so let's go ahead and change the type here to month and the name to month and the placeholder to month right so save that come back over the browser hit refresh and in Firefox this looks like a normal text box and the users actually going to have to type like January or whatever month they want to work with right whereas if you look at it in Google Chrome so let's come back here and refresh all these other elements look pretty much the same but you'll see that this month element looks very different to the way it looked in firefox and if you click on this you can actually use these little arrows to select a month and it'll only give you the option of January through to December and the nice thing about this one as well is if you look at it on your phone it'll also give you just a little drop-down list so you can pick a month easier on your phone rather than having to type out the entire month name you can just select it in a drop-down list and you'll see also it gives us another second option here which allows us to select the year right and so that's the difference between Firefox and Chrome is that chrome actually supports this date element or the state input type whereas Firefox doesn't actually support that a month input type and therefore it just shows as a normal text box right then there are a few others that we can work with so let's take a look at what time does or let's go time time time time I don't think I've even actually used time ever but again in Firefox it just looks like a normal text box but in Google Chrome and also if you look at this on your phone it'll give you a little bit of a better elements to work with so now you can actually pick a time down to the hours minutes and I think this will be a.m. and p.m. yeah okay so there we go these are some of the input elements I'm not going to run through all of them but if you go over to w3 schools I'll leave this link in the video description you can go ahead and check out some of these elements in fact you will have to scroll down the page somewhat but all of these types are listed down here one of the ones that might be worth looking at is range because this one works in Firefox and Chrome so let's just take a look at range as well let's go down here range range and range sort save this jump back and go to Chrome and let's take a look and you can see that you can now select a range of basically a number but we don't actually have a number count over here so there's still some missing kind of info that we definitely need a place in this element and you might want to just read about that somewhere and then the same thing in Firefox you've got this little range selector but again you don't know actually how much you're selecting so yeah you definitely want to use JavaScript or something to to put a little number next to here so you can see ok that's 100 and this is zero right and yeah now that we've taken a look at the different types of inputs and you guys know what they look like in different browsers and you know that it also works differently on a phone you can go ahead and play around with those I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev
