in this tutorial we are going to go over global objects now we've been talking about objects in general and we created this work object which of course is a custom object this is one that we created for ourselves but there are also global objects that Java Script provides that we can use now that we know what an object is and you will remember an object basically contains properties and methods and we call them of course using the object name and using the period to access whatever it is we want to access now as I said Java Script also provides global objects and these are basically objects that we can use anywhere in our JavaScript code and the nice thing about these objects is they are already are written for us and they give us certain types of functionality that we may want to use in our JavaScript program so again we can call them anywhere we want inside our JavaScript program and so as I said we can use the properties and methods and now that we know how an object is constructed we know exactly what that means now the first global object that we're going to look at in this lecture is the string object now we've been talking about standalone or primitive variables and these are variables basically that contain one value they can contain a string an integer or a boolean which of course is a true or false now what happens is JavaScript provides some objects based off the type of data type that we're using so for instance this of course is a string variable and since we're using a string variable javascript provides a string object that we can call that gives us all this functionality in relation to strings and so that's again what we're going to go over in this video now in the next video we'll talk about math and number objects and we can use those to do all sorts of things as well so let's pull up a little JavaScript program here and I've created a string variable and it just contains the sentence hello how are you doing so a nice string that we have now what happens like I said there is a string object that JavaScript provides and so what happens here is once JavaScript determines that this is a string variable it basically takes this string object and wraps it around our variable and basically it enables us to you all of the methods and properties in the string object in our string variable and so now like I said we can use the methods and properties in the string object to do all these neat little things against our string and what's also interesting is we don't have to write out string dot since it's wrapped around our string variable we could just call it using our string variable name like I said we don't actually have to use the string name here it's already there because javascript has wrapped it around our string variable for us okay so now let's take a look at some of the more popular properties and methods that we can call to do all sorts of things against our string so let's first call a method and this is a very common method that's used in JavaScript and it's the to uppercase method and you guessed it it will take all of these characters and convert them to uppercase now there's another method called lowercase and I think you get an idea what that does and actually since we're changing the value here we need to use the equals operator so let's go ahead and run this and there you can see now our string is converted to uppercase now of course we have to use the parentheses to call this method but there are also properties within the string object as well and one of those is the length property and you can see right here the intellisense that we get from notepad plus plus gives us the length property by the way you can see all these different properties that you can call there's quite a few of them so you can look through those and read up on some of them but anyways we're going to call the length property and we'll go ahead and run this and we get 23 now what that means is there are 23 characters within this string and they're actually called units now like an array it'll actually start out counting the first character with a 0 so this would be an index of 0 this would be 1 2 3 4 it would actually count the empty space so that's five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty see two on the last character now you might be asking wait a minute we just got 23 well it throws an extra unit after the last character so that's why we get 23 so just remember again that when you use this property the index always starts out at a zero kind of like an array index does now let's take a look at another useful method and this is called the car at or care at method and again we need open parenthesis now we're going to actually pass a value into this and we're going to pass let's pass four and what this will do is give us the character that's at the fourth index so 0 1 2 3 4 so we should get an O because that's at the fourth index spot so let's go ahead and run this and we get an O which is what we wanted now let's take a look at another useful method which is the replace method okay now what this does is it basically will replace the word doing and the word that you want to replace has to go in this first position and then there's a comma so we'll replace the word doing with the word today and the new word that we're going to use has to go in the second position so that's how that works so now this strings just say hello how are you today so let's go ahead and run this and you can see now we get the 2-day word which is what we wanted in this phrase so it reads hello how are you today so that's exactly what we wanted now we can also make the text in this string bold by using the bold method so let's go ahead and do that and there you can see there's the bold method and we'll go ahead and run this and now you can see our text is bold and we can even italicize our text using the italics method and there you can see we got the expected result ok that's going to do it for the string object in the next video we will discuss the math and number object
