hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the past video tutorial we have seen html5 forms new controls right in this tutorial I am going to discuss new html5 form attributes how they are helpful to control our forms utilize our forms in an efficient way so let's get started this is a form that we created and this is a source code for it so here first attribute we are going to discuss is disabled attribute if you want to disable any control then you can use a disabled attribute it's very simple to use Here I am writing disabled if I make it disabled then user cannot interact with that control file save go to browser and refresh you can see that this textbox got little bit greyed out and now it is not enabled I cannot enter the text that means user can't interact it is disabled you can disable any control by using disabled attribute for example I want to disable this color picker by adding here an attribute disabled file save go to browser and refresh you can see if I click on this button I am not getting the color picker that is about disabled attribute hope you guys have understood next is hidden attribute hidden attribute is used to hide a control or a HTML element for example I want to hide this text box then I am going to use attribute called as hidden file save go to browser if I say refresh this text box will get hide you can see that it got hidden similarly if you want to hide a complete HTML element for example control X control V I am putting the hidden attribute in a development the complete division itself is going to hide file save your browser and refresh you can see that the complete div dot hidden so remember that you want to hide a HTML element or hide in a form control use the hidden attribute control X file save good browser and refresh I got the element back next attribute I am going to discuss is auto focus you can see here I have a page and if i refresh no element is automatically getting focus you can set auto focus to an element by using auto focus attribute so here I am using auto focus file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that automatically the first text box has a blue border set and a blinking cursor this form element is now automatically got focus when I reload the page if you want some other element to get auto focus you can use that auto focus in some other element for example I want the auto focus to be email-id control V file saved go to browser and refresh now email id is automatically focused do not use auto focus in more than one element because the browser might get confused to which element it should focus or actually what it does is from the top to down when it parses whichever the first element it has attribute auto focus that will get out of focus so better not to use auto focus more than one time okay next attribute I am going to discuss is placeholder attribute placeholder attribute is used to give some information to the user it just a placeholder for in some information okay I am good right here place holder equal to you can see file save go to browser and refresh at present I have a text box here there user has to enter his name I want to tell him that he need to enter his name as well as the last name how do I tell him normally user enters his name but I want to tell him he has to enter the name as well as last name to do that we use placeholder and here I say first name and last name if I write like that file save go to browser and refresh you can see that I get a text in a grey color inside the text box and now by seeing this text user can understand that he has to enter the first name as well as the last name so he enters the name Ravi meta like that I hope you guys are understanding what is the meaning of placeholder it is used to give information to the user placeholder and value are completely different okay value is the actual value of the control whereas placeholder is just an information to the user next attribute I am going to discuss is the required attribute required attribute is for form validation purpose we know that here I go back and refresh if I try to enter some text and try to submit automatically the browser is doing validation it is telling that it is not a proper email ID you have to enter the proper email ID for example I enter the proper email id and submit then the form is getting submitted one more thing is I want to add one more validation that user must sign should give the his name he has to give an email id he has to give a URL then only the form should get submit otherwise it should not get submit even though I don't give any information if I click on the submit button the form is getting submitted to control that we are going to use an attribute called as required so here I am writing required file save go to browser and refresh this time if I try to submit you can see that browser is telling please fill out this field then only I submit this form so I must and should have to give a value to this textbox otherwise the form will not get submit let me enter here our avi Ravi I am selecting and click on submit now the form is getting submitted I can use the required attribute any number of times copy this and I can paste it somewhere else also may be user must and should enter his name as well as email id save go to browser and refresh this time if I try to submit it is telling please enter the name I enter the name Ravi and I again click on submit it is telling please fill out this field also and then I select the email id I click on submit it is getting submitted that is how you can use the required attribute required attribute is used to validate a control that user must and should enter a value for that control at any time for example you do not want the form validation should happen then you can use an attribute called as no validate in the form tag if you write no validate you are telling to the browser that do not validate is form element file save even though you have this required attributes used they don't work let's go back and refresh this time if I click on submit you can see that the form is getting submitted because we told to the browser that you need not to validate this form if I remove that and save file save go to browser and refresh and click on submit now it is again validating this is how you can control the validation of the form so I'm going to remove these required attributes next attribute I am going to talk about ease tab index you can give gap index to each form control for example here I am going to give auto focus and I give a tab index to it tab index equal to I give a value here one let's see what happens and I give tab index to email id here tab index equal to two and I save file save go to browser and refresh you can see auto focus happen and now the blinking cursor is inside the txt username text box if I press the tab key what happens we see you can see that it has moved to the email id text box the reason is this has a tab index too normally if you do not give tab indexes lets me show that I am going to remove this tab index - Here I am going to remove this tab index 1 and I save file save go to browser and refresh and you can see this is got out of focus and if I press the tab key it goes to the next control you can see it has moved to the password control next is the mail control then the check box next check box next check box then text area then like that it goes from top to down one after the another if you want to change the tab indexes if I press the tab key it should go according to order I that I decide for example I want tab index for this is one that means first the form control should be here when I press the tab it should directly go to the email ID so I am going to say here tab index equal to two then it should go to blog URL so I say here tab index equal to three do not give equal numbers then it should go to the password field for example here I say index equal to four let's see how it works file save go to browser and refresh if I say tab you can see that it has moved to email ID I press the tab it has moved to the blog URL I press the tab it has moved to the password and then again it follows the normal flow that is how it works I hope you guys are understanding that is how the tab index is used that is all about tabindex attribute it is very very useful attribute guys I am going to remove these tab indexes now so these are the few new html5 form attributes guys I suggest you people to try to use these things in your forms they are very very useful attributes to control the forms I hope you guys have understood also how these attributes behave and how to use them we discussed about all these elements so type text creates a text box type equal to password creates a password box type equal to radio creates a radio control type equal to check box creates the check box control then text area is used to create a text area select tag is used to create a selection list it may be a single selection list or it may be a multiple selection list then we have understood type equal to email creates an email control type equals to URL creates URL control type equal to date helps us to create a date picker type equal to color helps us to create a color picker type equal to file helps us to create upload file facility for this tutorial this much is enough friends and in the next tutorial we get more information for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with
