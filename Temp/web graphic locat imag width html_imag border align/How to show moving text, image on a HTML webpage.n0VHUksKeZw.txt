in this video I am going to show you how to move text or image on HTML web page in order to do that you have to write HTML tag called mark we and when the tag you have to write slash mark we and now if you write anything inside this mark we tag your text or image will move on your HTML web page so just try with some text my text is moving save the file go to your browser refresh it now you can see your text is moving from right to left so let's discuss some features of this marquee tag okay you can see once your text finished is movement then it starts again from the right and it's going to the left but if you want your text to bounce back from the left side then you have to write mark we behavior and give it a value called alternate save the file refresh the page now wait and see what happens your text started moving from right to left and once it comes to the left portion then it bounces back to the right again so you can see that in order to bounce back your text you have to use behavior alternate if you don't like it then just use behavior scroll okay another thing I want to show you about moving text is you can see in our example or what we did just before some time our text is moving from right to left but if we want to move our text from left to right then we have to write direction and we have to write write save the document pan our browser and we fish again now you can see our text clip moving from left to right that this is about Dillon tag and now use some image to move delete the text write code for image image Sarge I've already put an image in the same folder login underscore image dot PNG okay I put an image here so save the document open your browser and you can see our image file source code is moving from left to right and once it touches the right panel I mean that is the right age then it bounces back to the lift again so now we can move text and image on our HTML web page and before I am going to finish my tutorial I want to discuss about another thing I mean about the moving speed actually you can control the moving speed by writing a scroll amount and give it a value okay let's give it a value of 20 let's see what happens save the file refresh the browser and now you can see your image is started moving very very fast and let's decrease it to scroll amount to let's see what happens refresh the browser now you can see your image is moving a little bit slowly so in this way you can move text or images on your website by using a simple tag called mark we and you can use behavior direction scroll amount and if you want to use animals things I think you can do whatever you want with your image or your text for moving text or image on HTML web page video thank you
