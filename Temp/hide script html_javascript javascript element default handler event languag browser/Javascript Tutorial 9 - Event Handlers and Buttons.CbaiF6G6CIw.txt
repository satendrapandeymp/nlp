hello and welcome to your next tutorial on JavaScript and today we're going to be talking about event handlers and buttons now an event handler basically what that is is another way for you to control when a piece of code executes and the most common event handler and most widely used is the on click the best way for me to explain what these are is to just show you so basically all these different event handlers do not need to be inside JavaScript code instead they're they are an attribute of HTML tags so for an example in my body I can add in an on click and this end the words are um each word in these event handlers are always capitalized except for the on so I'll just have been on and then capital c li ck and notice how the text turns red and basically i make an equal sign with a pair of quotes and your javascript the JavaScript code that you want to execute goes in between these quotes now the reason why I'm teaching you this after teaching right after teaching you functions is because you never never want to just write out all the JavaScript information that you want to have execute yeah in HTML tags you want to just type out the function name and then refer to that function so I'm going to create a pair of script tags up here you know what I'll just use the you know I know I say I shouldn't do this but I'll just create the script I'll just use the script tags down here so I'll create a function called example and basically I'll have it create an alert box and where should we have it say don't touch me bunch of exclamation points now what this onclick handler does is whenever you click this element right here so this is the body it will execute whatever is inside these quotes so I can put the function name in here so I will type in example and that is it notice how this is not within the script tags don't worry it does not need to be so you can just click Save and then when i refresh the page and then click the body of this file I say don't touch me all right yes sir mr. president no no okay um and yeah that's the on click event handler I should probably show you a better example outside of script tags let's create an image and what should source be I'll use my haven't you guys have not seen this guy in a while well you will again today give it an alternate name of smiley and I'll just end it there you can also give an unclick to the images as well to image tags so I could say on click as soon as I click the image again I could have the example function execute so I'll click Save and you know what just to show you that because it's still within the body so this would still execute so I'll get rid of this and then I'll refresh the page and now we've our smiley and when I click it don't touch me but when I click anywhere else oh see I got highlighted um yeah it's only when you click the smiley but the alert box pops out on and yeah that's about it for the on click event handler and you can just use it within any set of HTML tags and then refer to the function of which the information you want to execute now the next one is the onload so the unload will most likely always be put in either your header tags your body tags I'll just put in put them in my body tags and this all other words after on or capitalized so the load will be capitalized and let's create another function so I'll just copy this and create another function and I'll call it I'll just call it load why not and I'll just create an alert that says welcome to this site whoa miss about it I'll click Save and the onload as you could have guessed as soon as it loads this function that didn't write yet this message will pop up so I'll click Save and when i refresh the page and I'll take my mouse off so you know I'm not doing anything that says welcome to this site and when I click the image I still get the don't touch me the next one the next event handler and there's actually a few others that I won't be showing you they're not used as much but there's only two more that I'll show you in this tutorial and that's the on mouse over the on Mouse out and I actually forgot one on unload I'll show you I shoot the on unload as well anyways let's do the mouse over so what this does is it executes a piece of code when your mouse goes over some elements some HTML element and you don't want it to be the body because every time you move around every time you go back onto the body that it's going to happen again and again so let's mess with the image instead so let's make it instead of on click on mouse over so when I click Save and then refresh the page iTunes I go over it oh it's check out the welcome to the site and then go over it just went right over mmm still sighs the same piece of code there's also the next one to teach is the end remember you can use these for any kind of tags paragraph tags the h1 to h6 your tables forms whatever you can use them for all of them the next one is the on Mouse out and this is pretty much the opposite you can put your cursor over the picture but then when you leave it then that message will pop up so I'll refresh the page again and I'll go on the image and when I leave it there it is now the last one I'm going to show you is the on unload so basically it's just on unload flash primate that lowercase there you go and what this does is when basically when you're leaving the site it will execute a piece of code so I would actually you know what I'll create a confirm box instead whoops and I say now this this wouldn't really work anyways because it's not it's not an official pop-up it's just a confirm box so where do you click okay a cancel it won't matter but I'll just say just for fun are you sure you want to leave not that it's going to make a difference so on unload of the body it'll execute wrong one I'll make this one called I'll just call it unload and I'll call this function unload so first of all I'm gonna create another tab now I'm going to refresh this one and then right close it now we're not on that page anymore so that special little box doesn't pop up anymore this is the kind of window that you would normally see in Internet Explorer I believe it is but it's still says are you sure you want to leave but because this wasn't an official you know like a pop-up or whatever it didn't matter we already left so it so it doesn't matter what you click as I said before now I just close this whole thing and reopen now I won't reopen it yet I want to get rid of the on unload but anyways that's about it for that now the last thing I like to show you is creating a generic button now we've created different buttons before I'm going to remember I'm staying within my HTML tags but outside my script tags we've made different types of buttons before and basically it was the submit and reset we did these with forms there's actually another type of button that you can create and that's just a generic button so you just call it button instead of reset or submit you just call it button and the value what that is is whatever text will appear on the button so I'll just have it say click here then you can put add an event handler to these any button any button on any website the only reason why they work is because they have an event handler so I'll throw in an on click and I'll create I'll change the example I'll change it to thank you for listening to me because they know because the button is saying click here so it will say thank you for listening me makes sense right and I'll have it load and I don't think that was a whoops equals and then I'll have it go through the example function so I'll click Save and we're now going to see our button so here it is no HTML tags to you know Center it or anything it just says click here so that's the value not the name the value and unclick Oh make sure you guys can see it and it says thank you for listening to me and that's about it that's about it for five different event handlers I believe I showed right yeah five of them and you the generic button in which you can then execute whatever code you want whenever you want and that's about it for this tutorial I'll see you next time
