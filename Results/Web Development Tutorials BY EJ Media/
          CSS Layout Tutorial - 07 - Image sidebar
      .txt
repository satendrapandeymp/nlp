welcome to the seventh video on CSS layouts in this video we're going to add another sidebar but this time we're going to use an image and that image will cover the entire area of the sidebar now I got an image of a flower off of Wikimedia Commons and I will paste the link into the message board of this video where you can get that image if you want to follow along but you can use any image you want now if we open this up in Microsoft Paint you can see here I added some text down here and we're going to put in sort of a fake advertisement for buying flowers and if you want to add this text you just hit the text button here and then you can go ahead and draw a rectangle and you can type in your text there if you want to do that okay so let's close out of this now the first thing we need to do of course is create some HTML so let's go ahead and do that and as we know now we have to put that after our second sidebar but before our main content panel so let's go ahead and do that I already typed it out so I'll copy and paste it into here and actually let's rename this class and we'll call this image sidebar a very relevant name now of course we're going to use divs again you'll notice that we're going to put the class this time inside the IMG tag not with the div now we'll put a class here layer but for now we're going to create a class for the IMG HTML tag now the key here is we want the same attributes as our sidebar so we want to be the same width have the same margin so we can use some of this code over again so let's just go ahead and copy and paste this and we're going to of course call this image sidebar now we do not want a background color because we want the image to take up all the space so we don't need that so we can get rid of that we don't need to worry about the font size we can get rid of that and we don't want any padding because if we put padding in that will reduce the size of the image we want that to expand completely out but we still need to count the padding because we want it to equal our other sidebars so this is 40 pixels so we need to add that to the width because that gets counted so we'll make this 300 pixels and now we can get rid of the padding we're obviously going to continue floating this right and we will continue to use a border radius and we will use the same margins and we will also use the clear right parameter so let's go ahead and save everything up and let's see what we get oh but before we do that make sure that you put the image inside the website folder whatever image you decide to go with and of course make sure the name of that image matches what we have here the source parameter and then everything should be just fine okay so let's go ahead and open up our web page and there you can see we've got our nice image now it expands all the way out in terms of the surface area of the element and we've got our nice advertisement here and that looks pretty good now in the next video we're going to actually add some effects to this sidebar see you guys then
