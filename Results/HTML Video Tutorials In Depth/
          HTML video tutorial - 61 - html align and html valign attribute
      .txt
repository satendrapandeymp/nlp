hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss a line and V align attributes with respect to table row with respect to table cell let's begin first I am going to use here a line attribute a lig and a line in double quotation I can give left right center le ft left if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that table is already aligned to the left let me give here c e and ter center file save go to browser refresh you can see that the table is aligned to the center of the browser window if I increase the browser width you can see that table still stays at the center so that is the work of align Center similarly if I say here right righ T right align right file save go to browser refresh table will get aligned to the left of the browser window actually it floats the table to the right you can think like that so hope you guys have understood how align attribute works with respect to table let's go to table row and understand how it effects to the table row I add an attribute to the first table row here we have a first table row there I say a lig in a line in double quotation I say C en de our Center file save go to browser refresh let me copy this align Center from here and I paste here for the first row control V file save go to browser refresh you can see that the text in the table row is aligned the center complete all text in all cells are going to be aligned to the center I can copy this align and paste it to the next which is this I say instead of align Center I say align left' file save go to browser refresh you can see that even to expand to the left all content in all cells of that row are aligned to the left hope you guys are understanding how a line works in the table row control V align I say ri ght right file save go to browser refresh content in that complete row aligned to the right so you can use left right and center for aligning the text let me talk about V align how it works va Li G and V align is actually used for aligning vertically vertical alignment is by default you can see set to Center I can say here top file save go to browser refresh you can see that text moved to top in that room if I say bottom Bo ttom bottom file save go to browser refresh text is now aligned vertically bottom to the cell if I say here mi double D le middle file save go to browser refresh text is in the middle vertically it is aligned middle hope you guys are understanding how the align attribute and V align attribute works on a room similarly you can use the align and via line in the table cells also take an example I have here Renauld of text and I want to align it bottom then I can say here V a lig and align in double quotation I can say Bo TT om bottom file save go to browser refresh you can see that the Renault text is aligned to the bottom you can use align and be aligned in table data table row hope you guys have understood how align attribute works with respect to the table with respect to the row with respect to the table cell and I hope you guys have understood how we align attribute works with respect to the table row and table cells so remember that align attribute if you are using with respect to the table it takes values left right center if it is left the table will be aligned to the left if it is Center table will be aligned to the center of the browser window if it is right then the table is aligned to the right of the browser window the same align attribute if you are using with the table row or a table data it affects to the text not to the table or a table cell it aligns the text in the table cell or a table row to the left right or a center similarly V align stands for vertical align it takes three values top middle and bottom via line effects to the text that means it puts the text either at the top or at the middle or at the bottom of the cell for this tutorial this much is enough friends experiment yourself more for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
