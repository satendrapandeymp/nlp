hey guys welcome to another JavaScript lesson last lesson what you guys did was you learned how to create some variables and store some information in the variables so we had a variable called name and we stored the string John into that variable and we output that variable to the screen in combination with some other strings and we also learned how to add numerical variables together so now in this third lesson what we're going to do is accept input from the user to put inside our variables and there are several ways that you can accept input you can either ask the user to type in something through a message box or you can have a form on the screen where the user types in are the numbers in the form and then click a button to submit that information so we're going to show you both ways today so the first way was we're going to ask the user what their name is and then output their name onto the screen so let's try that so instead of the name John what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a function called prompt now a function is like this document dot right so instead of writing a function writing a message to the screen I'm now using a function to accept input from the user so the function is prompt and the argument of the function is the message that you want to show on the screen so please enter your name okay so what's going to happen is if I save this and i refresh the page the first thing that shows up on the screen is the message box saying please enter your name and if I press add and I click OK then what happens is it has accepted my input into the variable called name and then it outputs onto the screen using the input that I have provided the next thing I want to do is show you guys how to accept input from a form a HTML form on the screen so the first thing you need is an HTML form so if you don't remember how to do that have a look at our previous HTML or PHP tutorials but basically on our page after our script I'm going to actually before our script I'm going to have a HTML form and the ID of the form is form 1 so every form needs an ID which is what we're going to use later to refer to this and I'm going to have name which is what appears on the screen and then I'm going to have an input box and name of the input box is name and the type of the input box is it's going to accept texts and the size of it is going to be 20 ok and then if I finish off the form tag and i refresh the page and I'm getting I'm gonna get rid of this prompt for now and change your back to John okay so what happens on the screen when i refresh is that it says it's got a name um text and it has a message box and I can type in there and nothing nothing happens okay and the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a button so that when I click the button it is going to run the rest of the code and accepts my input from the text box into the variable name so what I'm going to do underneath the form is I'm going to program a button so bracket button on click which specifies what you want the button to do when it's clicked and when it's clicked I'm going to run a function and I'm just going to call this function output name okay and the function has a pair of bracket after it and the name of the button is gonna say submit and you will see that if i refresh this page now oops I should have slash button not /a here okay it's got a submit button but when I click it nothing happens and that is because I haven't defined this function yet so to define a function all you have to do is you put the code function output name okay and then you put in braces and then I'm gonna put the rest of the code and I don't need the numbers anymore inside braces okay so all of this code is only going to run when I click the button okay so if I save it refresh all of that stuff's disappeared and I click Submit it runs the code however there's a couple of problems okay number one all of our old staff have disappeared number two are it didn't accept our input as the name so let's fix those problems one by one so the first thing I want to fix is rather than saying John every time it's going to accept whatever I have written in the form as the input to the variable so I'm going to define another variable called X and what this variable is going to do is it is going to X is going to be used to store the information that I'm going to retrieve from the document objects which I'll explain later on what this function does but basically this function will retrieve all of the information that I'm entering into form one and put it inside the X variable okay so the next thing I want to do is um I have the whole form stored in X and now I want to retrieve this field which is called name within that form okay so this text field the name of it is called name and I want to retrieve that in my form so I'm going to allocate um that text field to another variable cord let's call it Y okay so I'm going to declare another variable called Y and I'm going to store the information from that text field which is going to be accessed by X dot elements and bracket quotation mark name and I'm going to store this information in Y okay so what this does is it goes into my X variable and it gets the element name which is whatever I'm writing in this form and it's going to put in this variable Y so later on when I want to write the name onto the screen I'm just going to use the letter Y to represent that so if I save this and I've I'm going to refresh the page so if I type something here let's say add I click Submit um it still didn't work because I want the value of this element okay so I forgot the dot value basically it means I want the value of this object not the object itself so if i refresh that submit again it has worked okay so it's obtained the value from my text field and output it to the screen but the problem is I want my form to still be there so what I'm going to do is on my HTML page outside the script I'm going to declare a section a paragraph and I'm going to call the paragraph ID give it an ID equals I'm going to call it demo okay and you'll see why I'm doing that in a second but basically instead of writing this to the screen I'm going to use dot get element by ID bracket quotation mark demo so what it's doing is I'm going to the my HTML document so this document object represents my whole page and I'm going to the demo part of my page and I'm going to change the HTML inside my element to this okay so inside this section it's now going to say hello ed ed okay and I'm going to similarly change that to here so and get rid of the brackets here so now this says we drag this over a bit so you can see the whole line now this says I'm going to change the demo section of my page to say Edie is a very good tutor however if I just do that it's going to replace the line from before okay so I'll show you what I mean so if I save this and i refresh this page press ctrl R to refresh if you didn't know that already and I click Submit what happened is it's come up with Idi is a very good tutor but the previous line doesn't show up so I'm going to put a plus sign before the equal sign and what this does is it adds this line to the line before instead of replacing it so if I save that if I save that and i refresh my page click submit again it has hello ed it is a very good tutor so I've managed to make my form stay on the page and output some texts using the input from my form okay I hope you guys have learned something today we'll explain everything in more detail later on see you guys next time you
