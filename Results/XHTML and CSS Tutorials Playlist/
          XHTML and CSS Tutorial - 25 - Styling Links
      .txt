what is going on guys is Bucky and welcome to your 25th XHTML and CSS story and in this tutorial we're going to be going over how to style the links and if your eyes are like alright I know that a link is a so if I just go ahead and type a and write how I want to link to appear it's good no need to watch this tutorial well not so fast because a link is actually a lot more complicated than you might think a link is actually composed of something called States and a state is basically when and how you press the link so I'm just going to go through different states and then you guys are going to understand what I'm talking about there's one link for when the page is first visited there's another state for when the link has been clicked there's another state for as you're mousing over them link and there's the last state is as your mouse button is down and as you are clicking the link so one link can have four different styles and they typically do have four different styles believe it or not so let's go ahead and let me show you how to not only change the styling on the link but change is styling on each different state so let's go ahead and just add um well first of all we know that element four link is a so let's go ahead and add a link on our screen so a href hello a href equals of course is going to go to the new boston calm and just type the new Boston and check it out and we'll just actually add some this is just normal text so now we have a link and when we refresh it we have a link in some normal text but as you can see whenever we are hovering over it or remember we are clicking it it changes the read so we can begin to see the different kind of states right now but maybe we don't want it to be you know purple by default or when we click it to turn red those are the things we're going to adjust so by default before you even click Oh link it's gonna be at its default state in that is a semicolon link the a stands for the anchor of course which is the element in the semicolon and the name after it this is the state so now this is basically the default link now we can style it what it is by default and let's just go ahead and add color red and text decoration let's set this to none now the text decoration you can either have this like underlined or I think um there's something called like strikethrough or line three or something no never use it it's basically underlined or none so first let me point this out before I confuse you guys when i refresh this you says by default it doesn't turn red that's because I already went to this site before plenty of times the New Boston com so actually what state we're looking at right now is visited so let's go ahead and edit that right now a visited is when you already clicked a link and you know it's like links visiting you know what it means why might explain this to you so we want the links that we already visited let's go ahead and just turn them green something real simple so now when we go ahead and save and refresh this since this link has already been visited that's why it's going to appear green just like that so now we know how to adjust the style for default links that we haven't been to and links that we have been to now I told you guys that there are other states other than this and that is one their state is when you are hovering over the link now this doesn't matter if you already been to it or you have um not been to it when you're hovering over it you're hovering over it so let's go ahead and make this one a lot different so background color let's just change this to blue change the background to blue and what else can we do change the color of the text to white that might make it a little little easier to read put text decoration underlined I always like hovering over to be underlined so in order to get you need to change the property called text decoration and let's just go ahead font-weight:bold make sure I spelled that right good enough so now whenever you hover over it let me just go ahead and do this whenever you hover over it um you get a blue background you can see the text changes from green to white you get an underline and your font turns from regular to bold pretty cool huh so that's like how to make your website kind of dynamic and changing using just basic CSS so you know just thought I throw that out there so now the one last day I want to cover is called the active state now the active state is as you are pressing down and your finger is holding down that button this is the active state so a active what do we want to do when our mouse button is active let's just go ahead and do something simple change your background color to orange simple enough so let's go ahead and save this and let me explain you guys what my finger is doing all right right now I'm just moving my mouse now I'm hovering over it so that's where that a:hover comes into play and now I'm clicking down maybe you can hear me here let me let me you can hear my mouse see now I'm holding it down now it's active and of course if I let go it's going to go ahead and take me to the greatest website ever the new boston.com there we go welcome to the new Boston have to check this out later bye anyways that is the basics of the different states I mean before you might be thinking alright a links a link a link a link but no it's actually composed of four different states and that's what get a lot of people hung up and confused what now you guys have edge on them because you understand those different states and how you can alter them so that's all I got for you guys for this tutorial thank you guys for watching to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
