hey YouTube how's it going into Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number five and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about bold and italics and comments actually so I've got a paragraph that I prepared before this tutorial just kind of like save time so you wouldn't have to watch me type all of this out and I'd like to bold this sentence and then I'd like to put this sentence and I tallix now there are a couple different ways to bold text in HTML but using just pure HTML know CSS I'm going to show you guys two different ways now the first way I'm going to show you guys is semantic markup now semantic means that the HTML actually means something you want most of your text or most of the markup on your page to be semantic because well semantic is read out in screen readers differently so let me go ahead and just type all this stuff out then I'll come back to talking about semantics semantics so let's say I want to bold this text well the semantic way to bold this text would be to use a strong tag and then to go back over to the end of that sentence and just close off my strong tag if you forget to close this off then it will bold the entire paragraph so let me go ahead and save this now and come back over to the browser refresh the text that you saw displaying here was from the previous tutorial let me go ahead and maybe just zoom in on this a little bit so you can see it more clearly but you can see that all of this is normal text or all of the rest of this is normal text but over here we have some bolded text so that is how you bold text semantically and then to do it the non semantic way you could just bold it using a be tagged now this is the non preferred way you shouldn't actually be simply using the B tag you should use the strong tag whenever possible so let me go ahead and hit refresh in the browser and as you can see there is no visual difference between using the B tag and the strong tag so if you're simply just trying to bold text for visual purposes then you know the B tag and the strong tag no visual difference but to Google search robots or to screen readers for blind people or to other user agents that use HTML whenever you use the strong tag like I said this is semantic markup now semantic markup you can go ahead and google the definition but basically this is HTML that means something a screen reader would read this out in a different voice so if this was this is normal text then this would be strong text you know it would it would carry more weight behind it I hope that was not too loud in the microphone and yeah let's take a look at the italics so I want to italicize this sentence so I'm just going to go ahead and surround that in an e/m tag now eeehm stands for emphasis and this is the semantic way of creating italics so let me come back here and hit refresh and now you can see this sentence has been italicized so again semantic markup would just mean that a browser a screen reader may read this out differently or a search robot like google may read this up differently so we'd have normal text again and now we'd have some italics I don't know how you'd put emphasis on that in your voice but yeah basically emphasis is the semantic way of marking this up and you could also do with the non-semantic way using an eye tag but this again is non semantics so it's not the preferred way of italicizing text but you know go ahead and create the eye tag and come back here and refresh and you'll see there is no visual difference between the eye tag and the emphasis tag it's just that people prefer to use e/m over the eye tag so now that we've taken a look at how to bold and italicize text I want to talk to you guys about HTML comments because this is something that we're probably going to be using in the next couple of videos and it's just nice to know right know here at the beginning so an HTML comment is created using the smaller than sign and exclamation mark and then two hyphens or two minus signs whatever you want to call those and then you end off your comments by creating two hyphens and the greater than sign you'll notice anything in between those two symbols turns gray so it's commented out this basically means that text within these comments does not display in the front end it does not display in the browser but it does display in the text editor so that we as the programmers can read this and it's it's great for leaving notes to yourself explaining code to yourself or maybe like you have a paragraph like this that you're not quite sure if you want to display on the website right now so you can just comment that out and you know when you refresh it it's not going to display on the webpage so right now I'm not quite sure about this text I don't want it on the side so I'll comment it out but then when I do want to display it I'll just take my comments away and it will now display on the site but like I said it's also good for leaving notes to yourself so we learned bold and italics with this tutorial hopefully you spell your notes correctly that's kind of important to yourself you want to be able to reuse so yeah like I said anything within these comments is not going to show up in the browser and that is all I have for you in this tutorial so I will see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards
