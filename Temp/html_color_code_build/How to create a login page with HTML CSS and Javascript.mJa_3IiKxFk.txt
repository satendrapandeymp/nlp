hey guys in this tutorial I will be showing you how to create a login form with HTML CSS and JavaScript so note this is just a simple login screen so if you're going to use this on your website or whatever you're going to use it for please don't because you can actually just find the password by going in to inspect element being the source and getting the username and the password so let's get started first what we'll need is a text editor and I usually use notepad plus plus and I use brackets so you can actually download this the links will be in the description but you can just use your notepad on your computer it will work exactly the same way so our login will look like this so let's get started first I'm just going to open up brackets and you can just open up your you know your notepad go to file go to new and now we're going to save it as an HTML so I'm just going to name it login dot HTML and save as type what you want to do is just click all files and click Save and now we can get started so I'm using brackets right now bracket is pretty good because you can actually when you're typing the code as you can see it automatically closes the HTML file for you so we're going to start off with that and now what we're going to do is we're going to type in head and I'm not really going to explain what this all does so just follow along and the end product should look very similar and for our title the title is right here as you can see it's a simple login so you can actually name it whatever and I'm just going to put in login and now we're going to do our CSS so the CSS is what the page will look like the layouts and the graphics and stuff like that so let's get started so for the font we're going to be using this font right here if you just want to copy and paste the code you can actually do that or you can just you know follow along and type it because the code will be in the description so you can just download it so this is just the font that we're going to be using and now for the body what we need to type is we're going to make the body background make it all printing stuff so the what we're going to do so we're not going to make the background move so we're just going to make the background stay where it is without the scrolling and all that okay and for our background image what we need is a background image so I picked this image all you need to do is just go on to Google and search up an image so I'm just going to search up New York City and we're going to get an image from here and now what we need to do is view image and we need to copy the URL and what we need to do is we just got to paste it right in between these brackets right here and we want the image to cover the whole background and this right here this is our font color so our font color for our first half of the font will be white but you can pick any color and if you want to pick a color what you need to do is just go in the description there will be a link so if you got to copy this code right here into the color right here so it's telling the computer that this color is white so FFF is white and for the font family what we picked right here we're going to use that font and for our second half of the color what we're going to do is you know to go pick out your color and the second half of the color will be orange so we have white and orange so as you can see this is white and this is orange and now we're going to make the login so the login we need the login to be in the middle of the page so this is what we're doing right now okay and now we're going to make the look for our username right here so we need it to be transparent and with a white border so we're going to do it right here and now we're going to do the same thing into the password field so we need it to be in the middle of the page with the transparent background and with a white border so that's what we're going to do here - and now we're going to do the same thing for the button we need the button to be under username and password with a white background and when you hover over it it should be transparent as you can see here so when we hover over the login button it's going to have an opacity so it's going to be transparent okay so we are done creating the CSS style for our page so as you can see here this is all the code for the page so all the code will be in the description so if you just want to download it and you can change and you know create something different you can so all the source code will be in the description you don't have to type all this but you know if you have time you can type it but you know I'm not going to explain all this so you know this is where our login is the color of the text of the login the name the text color the background right here and you know what we need to do is we want to save this so I'm just going to click ctrl us now what we need to do is we want to create the body so the body is where our username the password login text will be below head and we want to create the body so we're just going to create body so what this is saying is when you right click it's going to not let you right click on the page so now as you can see what we created up here is going to be linking to the actual page so we need to link it so we're going to create a class and we're going to create a body class so up here as you can see it says body right here the page will go to this code right here and it's going to display the background image and whatever we have up here so the header will be this this is the header so the text that's right here we're going to put in the header and I'm just going to put in please subscribe so whatever you put in right here this is the first half of the text right here and this is the second half of the text and now we're going to create the login form so now we're done creating the form so we're done creating this now what we need to do is we need to implement the JavaScript so when you type in your password a message would pop up saying this is the right password you can go in or this is a wrong password access denied or something like that so now we're going to create the JavaScript okay so now we are done creating the form so let me explain what this is so our form is checking if the password you entered and the username is correct so now we're done click Save so now what we're going to do is we're going to open up the page and see what it looks like and as you can see here we have please subscribe and the username and password and this is actually a bit too big so I'm just going to change that into something else so let's just change it into this my channel save refresh and there you go so now our password we typed in do for the username and one two three as a password so if we just type in a random stuff and we try to click login as you can see this message will pop up so now if we type in the actual username password was one two three when we click login a new tab opens up and whatever website you've linked it up to will open up so that's it guys all the source code from this is in the description you can go download it so if you go right here that's how you change the background you want to copy the URL and just change this part and for the name on the side right here you can change it by going down online 145 you can change whatever name you want it to be and to change the username in the password go to line 162 and this is the username right here this it's password this is your username now when we refresh the page the user name is hello and for the password is abc' when you click login another website will pop up and to change the website online 164 and you can just change the website right here so that's it guys thanks for watching please don't forget to rate comment and like and if you like more of these videos share this video check out my channel and for our next tutorial I might be showing you guys maybe if you guys like this I'll be showing you how to create something like this and when you type in whatever information you can do this with any login and I will be showing you how to do that so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
