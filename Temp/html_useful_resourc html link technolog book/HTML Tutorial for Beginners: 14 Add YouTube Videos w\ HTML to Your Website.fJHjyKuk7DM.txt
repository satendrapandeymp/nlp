hey this is Sasha and thanks for joining me here for another training lesson on HTML and in this video what I want to do is share with you how to incorporate or embed a video with in your HTML so hopefully this will give you some more insights to building your business website or working with editing your business pages as you continue to evolve your business online so let's take a look at the code and show you how it works alright so the video element is it starts off with a couple of things so you first start out with video and if you hit the tab you'll notice we start with the video and then we end with the video now most of the time you'll be using again dot mp4 video formats that's just the standard format for video so again you'll go ahead and type in source right here I'll go ahead hit tab and you can see it already puts in the SRC code in there now i'm going to paste a link right from my hard drive so this is in my f drive right there i'm going to remove some additional quotes right there that got added and there you go so i have the SRC in quotes right there i'll hit save and as I go into refreshing the page you can see the video is quite huge and large it is is there but you can't really see see it too much so what I need to do is make some modifications to this so the better approach to do this is to just go directly into this top video element and do a width attribute and we could say 720 this is the pixels by hice and will do 480 ok so here if I go ahead and hit refresh you can see that video is showing up right there now if I click it nothing really happens right because we don't have video controls so again I need to add controls so if I go ahead add the controls right there hit refresh you can see now I have video controls on the bottom now they are a little bit hidden but I'm going to go ahead and drink this browser windows so that way you can see but there are the controls right there you can see me in one of the previous lessons that we did and that's kind of the video you could directly linked this in there or link this through an HTTP somewhere on the website if you like I just did it right from my hard drive but that's another way that you could do it's very similar to the audio controls but that's how you altima tlie do the video in order to add it to your pages now if you're looking to add a certain video on to let's just say from YouTube the best way and to show you a quick example here is if you go to the video right here and I already have this video pulled up and I go hit the embed area let's just go back to share normally you'll see things like this and that usually doesn't work for sharing purposes on your own website that's great for facebook twitter because they take that code and reprocess it but if you're looking to add it to your website you'll take this embed code which you'll notice is an iframe and we'll just go ahead and copy this code ok so again another reason why I frames are used and once you take this iframe code you copy it all you need to do is just go ahead and paste this in now this width and height that you can see is 640 and 360 frameborder 0 if I hit refresh you'll see that the video is right under there it gives me the youtube controls because the SRC is right there it works directly from YouTube it gathers all that data and so on if I want to take our frame border I could go ahead and do too and if i refresh you might not be able to see it but it should technically be there so anyways that's kind of the way that it works as far as embedding things from YouTube because you do with a nice ring you could modify and manipulate these if I wanted 720 x 480 and i'll go ahead hit save and then if we hit refresh you can see it's a little bit bigger but ultimately you need to play with the code to get it to process correctly so because I messed with the with the code the way that it's done it's not outputting it properly so let's take a quick peek here and see if we can modify this video size custom size so I'll do 720 x 480 and there's it's going to give me that code so you can see the wit a came 8 53 x 480 over here so i'll just copy this and then what I'll do is I'll paste that back in his face and now if I hit refresh you can see there we go that's the code that I was looking for and that's ultimately right there the size or width of that that screenshot for that video so that's how you incorporate video elements again you could include multiple sources if you are locating them directly on your hard drive or directly from another website if you'd like to do that you can add in multiple sources but if you're getting it from YouTube you could just go ahead and use something like the iframe right there and make things much easier for yourself all right so thanks for joining me in this video I hope you found it helpful don't forget to hit the subscribe button over here if you want to continue learning more in the future and if you
