hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series let me double click on the first page dot HTML I right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad we don't have any content fresh HTML page in this tutorial I am going to discuss how we can draw horizontal lines in a web page in HTML we have HR tag it is used to draw horizontal lines there is a tag called as HR this HR tag is unpaid tag that means there is only one tag which is going to contain both opening and closing there is no separate opening HR and closing HR tag okay it is an unpaid tag second thing is HR tag is a block level tag it takes the entire width of its parent that is a browser window here to create a horizontal line I am going to write less than HR name up the tag as it is a unpaid tag I have to close here only so I am going to use the forward slash then I use greater than symbol file save go to browser refresh you can see that the horizontal line is added to the web page this is how you can add a horizontal line if I write some text maybe hello file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello is moved to the next line as HR tag is a block level tag it takes the entire width of its parent and moves the remaining content whatever is there after that HR it is going to move to the next line so I am going to remove this content at present file save go to browser refresh HR tag has so many attributes which we are going to understand now less than HR space see Bo elbow or color there is a attribute with respect to HR tag called as color using that we can create colored horizontal lines so equal to in double quotation I am going to give color name so I give red at the end forward slash greater than file go to browser refresh you can see that it has added a horizontal line with color red this is how you are going to add attributes to an unpaid tag and use we know that we can also give the color in a hexadecimal value so I use hash ff0000 double quotation forward slash greater than symbol file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has added one more horizontal line with the red color next I am going to discuss the property called as size HR I am going to create color equals to maybe green ok so I am creating green color horizontal line for a slash greater than symbol file save go to browser refresh you can see that horizontal line is added with the green color here I am going to add one more attribute to HR tag I give a space I'm going to give here width so there is an attribute called as a width with respect to the horizontal line then you can mention what should be the width of horizontal line to apply the width of the horizontal line let's take I am going to give here 100 file save go to browser refresh you can see that the horizontal line is displayed with the width of 100 pixels and automatically the horizontal line will get online into the center of the browser window now I can create one more horizontal line so I am going to write here a char color is going to be I'm going to use a hexadecimal value hash 0 0 FF 0 0 double quotation for a slash greater than symbol file save go to browser refresh we have a horizontal line with the green color pure green color then I am going to add a width property width equal to maybe 100 pixels instead of 100 pixels I am going to say maybe 20% you can also mention the width of the horizontal line in percentage here if you write just a number it will take in pixels whereas if you give percentage sign then the horizontal line is drawn with a percentage if you consider this width is a hundred percent then maybe this much is the twenty percent so twenty percent of the browser window it acquires browser width it acquires and get displayed in the center we know that by default horizontal line will get a line in the center so file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has displayed in 20 percent and the color is set to green now the use of setting the percentage is let me show you if I minimize the browser window slowly you can see that automatically the horizontal line is getting smaller right based on the width of the browser window automatically it will calculate what how much the 20 percent is and it will change itself you can see that right I hope you guys are understanding so if I increase more you can see that this is now 20 percent very flexible okay next I proceed further HR see vuelvo are color equal to b lue blue color horizontal line I am adding file save go to browser refresh ok then width I am going to mention WI D th width is equal to 20 percent and if I say file save go to browser refresh it has God displayed 20 percent there is one more attribute I am going to add to the HR tag and that is size attribute size equal to now size indicates the thickness of the horizontal line if I give here 3 then this horizontal line is displayed three pixels file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has not increased the reason is maybe this is a three pixels let me try for five file save go to browser refresh you can see that now it is increasing let me give 50 file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed height is increased or thickness of the horizontal line is increased to 50 pixels let me try whether it works on 10% file save go to browser refresh you can see that this is not working 10 percent is not working 10 percent it is only taking 10 pixels let me remove this one file save go to browser and refresh you can see that there is no change so percentage won't work for the thickness of the horizontal line you have to write pixels only see 1 2 3 4 5 like that you can give the size of the horizontal line here in pixels whereas width you can mention in pixels as well as percentage of the browser available similarly I am going to explain one more attribute HR color equal to maybe I use blue itself so hash 0 0 0 0 FF that is a hexadecimal value width is equals to 20 percent and size is either the size equal to 10 pixels or a thickness right file save go to browser refresh we have one more view line with 20 percent here I am going to add an attribute called as a line a lign a line equal to already we have learned a line attribute with respect to the heading there we used to give values to align attribute left right and center we have seen align attribute with respect to paragraph also there we used to give 4 values left right center and justify with respect to horizontal line we can give left right and center three values we can give so let me give here left by default it is Center file save go to browser refresh you can see that horizontal line got displayed on the left hand side of the browser window similarly if I want to display it on the right hand side of the browser window file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed on the right side if I want it at the center I need not to mention the align attribute itself hope you guys have understood how we can draw horizontal lines with different attributes how attributes affects the horizontal lines so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share thank you guys thank you very much keep learning keep coding keep sharing
