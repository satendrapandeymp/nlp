what is going on guys welcome to your 40 second html5 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about how to work with images on the canvas because we learned how to do a lot of things with the canvas you can draw shapes we can put text on there we can rotate it grow it shrink it what else can we do add colors but there's going to come a point whenever you're making websites where you're going to need throw some images on your canvas so that's what I'm going to show you guys how to do now it's a little bit different than you know just it's a little bit more complicated I'm going to omit that then you might think what you need to do first is you need to make an image object and I'm just going to name mine pick now I'm going to set this equal to new image in this image class right here is already built into JavaScript we don't need to make our own classes or anything like that however whenever you make an image object it has a property called source now the source of this is basically where on your computer is the image located in mine is located in the folder called images and the file is called t-shirt dot ping now if you don't have any images on your computer for some reason earth they're really weird and dirty and you don't want to use them then what you can do is you can just go ahead and copy a URL from you know somewhere online and use it and it should work just fine so now that we said okay JavaScript that's where my image is now can we use it it's going to be like dude not yet because html5 is a little bit weird now listen this because you need to listen this or else what I'm going to do isn't going to make sense you can't just say okay my image is ready now I want to throw it on the canvas your image needs to load before you can put it on the canvas so we can't just put on right now because technically it doesn't know if it's loaded or not so what we want to do is we want to add an event listener in that event listener just like this one down here is going to wait for something to load we want to wait for the picture to load instead of the window so let me go ahead and just show you by example instead of waiting for the window to load which is like our website we want the picture to load now instead of calling this function we want to do something else so we're basically going to say okay as soon as our picture is loaded then we can draw onto the canvas so remember I said the second parameter of this add eventlistener as a function we could technically make another function and you know build it down here or something or here's another way you can do this you can just add the body of the function right in here and whenever you do is just going to run this bit of code right there so basically whenever our picture loads this bit of code inside this function is going to run so like I said you can only draw stuff on the canvas as soon as it loads so let's go ahead and draw it right now canvas draw image now the draw image function takes three parameters the first parameter is we're basically saying this ok canvas draw an image on yourself and it's going to say okay what the heck's the image well for that we need to give an image object which is this pick why did I copy that it's three letters I could literally type that in like half a second but anyways we're saying okay canvas drop pick and it's going to say okay but wait where the heck do you want me to draw it we say oh okay zero zero and I hate when my stupid freaking thing does that it goes to the next line makes it really difficult to read but anyways I believe that's it can't really tell because everything is on two fricken lines but let's go ahead and save this and see what we got as we can see what we did is we created a new image object that images slash t-shirt ping that's the image and it waited for it to load and then it drill on the canvas is zero zero and by the way did I mention this that this is my design for the t-shirts I'm making I give them away for free on my other YouTube channel if you're interested go check it out it's pretty awesome I'm actually giving some away for free today ten of them but anyways enough of me rambling on so that is that so what it does is it finds the size of your image and it basically draws whatever size it is so I think this one was I don't know looks like 150 by 150 or something but what if we wanted to draw this you know what if we want to stretch this out a little bit make it bigger or smaller what in order to do that in CREP I think I'm going to need stretch this out a little bit in order to do that what we can do is we can add two additional parameters to the end of this dry image it takes two more optional parameters a width and a height now we can explicitly give a value like 200 400 or another cool thing we can do is this we can take what is called the width in the height of the canvas and it's automatically going to stretch it to the width and height of canvas so what we could do is hit 600 400 or the canvas is stored in the variable X C document canvas it's stored in the variable X so all we need to do is hit X dot and remember the width is first so x width x height remember not to do like why I tore anything like that because my variables named X I'm not talking about the X and the y value so let me go ahead and save this and refresh it and see what we got now as you can see this picture is stretched to the width in the height of my canvas which is 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall so again like I said the only three parameters you absolutely need whenever you're using the draw image is what image do you want to draw and where do you want to draw it however you can have two more optional parameters after that of how why do you want to draw the picture and how tall do you want to draw it if you don't include those parameters then it's just going to take the default width and height of your image and draw it to those specs but if you want to customize things and then that's how you do it so anyways there you go there's the Storrow of how to work with images on the canvas so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next store bro
