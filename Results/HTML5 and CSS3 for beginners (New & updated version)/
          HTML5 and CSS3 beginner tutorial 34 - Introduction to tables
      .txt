hey youtuber how's it going is Clinton here and welcome to tutorial number 34 in the HTML and CSS series and in this video seeing as we've finally taken care of our layout I want to talk about tables so now that we have this this is actually done on purpose by the way now that we've taken a look at how to make a website layout I'm going to show you guys how to use table and the reason why I am showing you tables afterwards is because there was a time with web development especially like in the early 2000s and you know even up until five six years ago people were using tables to lay out their website and it is a practice that you still see happening today there are still people doing it today not good practice but it's just how they were taught how to do it so they carry on doing it this way but the problem is using a table to layout a website in other words to make like columns to make things appear next to each other is absolutely absolutely incorrect and you should never do it but yeah there were people who just when they were learning web development that's the way people decided to do things at the time because floating and clearing stuff in CSS was maybe just a little bit tricky or didn't really work when it came to cross browser compatibility and stuff like that so yeah so let's take a look at how to create a table and I've gone ahead and clear everything out of my index file I've also kid all of my CSS away and in fact we're not even to be doing CSS in this tutorial so probably not going to use this all right and then in my browser you can see I've got nothing here right so let's go ahead and add in a table to our website and you do that by opening up a table tag right so that tells HTML told the browser okay we want to make a table the next thing you need to do is Table tables consist of rows which go across and columns which go down right so we need to make a table row which is the TR tag so TR sense the table row go ahead and add one of those and then inside of the row you can go ahead and start adding columns so to make a column you add TD which I think stands for table data or yeah I don't know maybe there might be another word for it but table data is how I remember it right so this means that will now have one row with one column inside of it and I think that's going to be a pretty boring table so let's go ahead and copy the table data and I just add a few more make sure you add the table data is all inside of a table row so that we have basically now three columns in one row right and then you can go ahead and actually copy these down as well so now you can have three rows with three columns and let's let's make it a table with some information about people so the first column could be the person's name the second column could be their citizenship so where they come from and the third column could be I don't know how much money they have I guess right so yeah that would be three columns in a table let's go ahead and add in two people underneath this so I'm going to go ahead and add someone's name so basically what happens here is this table data is going to be aligned underneath this table data and this table data is going to be under underneath this one so all the first ones kind of line up then all the second ones kind of line up and then all the third ones kind of so let's go ahead and add Quinton what Citizenship South African money zero right and then we can go ahead and add a next person so let's go Sean coolly citizenship Namibian actually he isn't but anyway for the sake of this tutorial money let's go twenty South African Rand right so that saves us now take a look at what this looks like in the browser and you can see we've got a table showing up here it's just kind of maybe a little bit small and usually when you have a table you'd expect there to be some kind of a border or something but yeah this table doesn't have any of that so if you want to create a border on a table you need to add an extra attribute here so you can say a border equals one and that's just going to make a border of one pixel all right so let's come back here and refresh and now you can see that everything is actually laid out with the table cells is what the main you might know them as right so we've got these these two people but now the problem is these are our headings and this is just normal data and now we can't tell the difference between the heading of our table and the actual data of our table so we might want to make our headings displayed differently and actually HTML has taken care of that for us so they've given us something called a th tag which stands for table header and basically that can just replace all the table data's in the first row and that way we have our headings so that's come or did I say that just make sure I save come back here and hit refresh and now you can see that our headings display in a little bit more of a bold fashion so yeah basically we have the headings displaying a lot more clearly right there are better ways to style tables and we'll definitely be taking a look at that in the next video but for now just make sure that you know how to display tables with HTML right and another comment that I got on some of the older tutorials was somebody was confusing HTML tables with CSS are not CSS SQL tables sequel tables and HTML tables and sequel tables are totally totally different things so SQL we haven't learned about that on my channel yet I don't have any tutorials on that but sequel tables or SQL tables however you want to pronounce that word basically store data on a server in a database somewhere whereas HTML tables are used for displaying data and you don't have to be pulling data from an SQL table to display it with an HTML table but yeah you can just simply hard code the data in like we did with HTML or statically code the data and that's probably a better word and yeah have the data show up in a table just like this and so I'm going to end the tutorial up there but if you guys want to come back and check out the next tutorial we'll take a look at how to style a table and make this look a little bit more pretty because right now it's kind of like nasty looking and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses
