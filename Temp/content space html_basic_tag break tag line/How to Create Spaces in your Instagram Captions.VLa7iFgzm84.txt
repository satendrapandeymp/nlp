in this video I'm going to be showing you how to create spaces in your Instagram captions as you can see it is much easier on the eyes and I highly recommend this for longer captions so how do you do this you're going to open your Notes app click new note and start writing your caption now you're going to make sure that you do not leave any spaces after your last character like this you do not want that that is not going to work so go back and start writing one now this is what I used to do I used to space it how I wanted it to look but this wasn't working either so you're going to want to press return only once and then start writing so Instagram itself will add another space to it so it will end up looking the way you want and so just make sure you do that and when you add an emoji be careful a lot of people have problems with emojis but you just need to do the same thing and make sure that there's no space right after it so next you're going to copy it and open Instagram again now you're going to choose a photo and paste it in and press share so you get this cute turtle um and as you can see there we go it's perfect and spaced out how we want and that's it so super quick video today give me a follow at solopreneur sidekick and i'll talk to you guys soon
