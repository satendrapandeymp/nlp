hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 36 and in this tutorial we are continuing our mini-series on how to create a basic web sites or website layout and this is part 3 so I'm going to scroll down here to my side section because this is where we left off in the previous video and this is where we're going to start working now so if you guys watch the previous video then you will remember that we created an article or we learned about this article tag and created an article inside of our main section of our website okay then we went ahead and gave that article a heading or a header you know some content and an actual footer and explained how we can use all of this stuff so we can do the same thing in the aside section as well but this would be somewhat less important content in fact something that you might see in the aside section a lot on quite a few websites is social links so you might have an article tag like this and ending article or even a div tag so maybe let's just use a div and ending div and in here the user much or you as a designer mark putting a heading two and an ending heading two and in here type in something like social links and actually leave your Facebook and Twitter links below so to do that let's actually create an unordered list and ending an ordered list and again Li and ending Li and in here e to a to X okay so let's just give that an edge riff of nothing at the moment so it's blank and in here a type in facebook and compared to just duplicate this line and type in Twitter and we might also have other than the social links we might also have like another article or just related articles to this article where you have like a heading just to explain okay this is the other article you know just so the user can get interested and then a paragraph just for the user to read to see what that article is about and then maybe a see more button you know to click and actually read that story so let's create an article tag here and ending article and you know what I'm actually going to wrap all of these up in a div tag so let's just do that opening the knock that in one and ending div and in this article or in the still rather at the top here we could create a heading two again so ending heading two and here's where you would say like related articles or related stories or something okay and then you can have an article that was somewhat related to this main article so the user could come read this article and then go hey you know there's another story over here let me click on that and see what that's all about so let's go ahead now and just add in maybe a heading three and as the side headings here okay and you know this can be a heading for another story and below that just a paragraph to get the user interested so not the entire story but just a paragraph to get the user interested so get interested and click below to the more and beneath that we might have a footer that will just contain a link that says c-more so let's end that off like that as a and you know href and we won't take that anywhere but we might say c-more and the user can click here to read the full article and we can actually divide this up even further because like I said an article can have a header and this is indeed our header then we've got our paragraph which is just to get the user interested in the actual article and this is our footer which contains a the c-more link so we could go ahead and do something like this create a footer there and end it off there and again over here we could do the same thing with the header okay whoopsie-daisy there we go and ending hitter and now if I save this hand we go take a look at this in Firefox let's see what we've got okay so we have our logo our navigation which you know doesn't really look like navigation at the moment and we've got our main section over here but underneath that what the heck we've got our aside section underneath the main section so it's not actually appearing on the side just yet and then we've also got our footer at the bottom of the page okay so this doesn't exactly look like a website just yet but we do have all the content for the makings of a good or a decent website layout okay so in the next video we are going to start using CSS to actually get this logo appearing in the right place get this navigation you know maybe floated to the side here and appearing next to the logo this article can be centered and the side side news or aside tag should be appearing on the right-hand side of the the browser sorry I got a little bit confused a but yeah we'll get that floating to the right-hand side of the browser and we'll have our footer you know just expand the entire browser or something so I will see you guys in the next video and until then do not forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys next time
