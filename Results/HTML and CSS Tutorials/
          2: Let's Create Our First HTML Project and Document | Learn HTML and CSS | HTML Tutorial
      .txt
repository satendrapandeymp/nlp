today we're going to learn how to set up a new project when we want to create a website and we're also going to learn how to set up our first page inside the website so before we get started on the actual tutorial because of feedback from the last video I decided that we're going to use a different editor called Adam for these tutorials now I decided on this to avoid dipping any kind of misunderstanding so confusion from any of you in terms of the colors of features in the editor that I personally use sublime text which was mentioned in the previous episode cost about $70 and since not everyone has that to spare I will be using Adam because it's free and nearly identical to sublime text but without the annoying pop-ups that you get if you do not have the full version it is important to me that you guys have to follow my lessons in the best way possible so that you can get the most out of your lessons and that includes in my mind that we use an editor that everyone can afford so if you download sublime text or bought it in the previous episode just going to stick with it like I said in the previous episode the editors don't really matter when it comes to creating websites you can create websites inside any kind of editor so just to make sure everyone can follow these lessons I'm going to be using Adam for these tutorials okay so let's actually go and get started on creating a new web project so as you guys can see I'm inside Adam which is the text editor and when I want to create a new website like I mentioned in a previous episode we need to create a new folder inside our computer somewhere now my case I'm just going to go to my desktop I'm going to right click and then I'm going to go ahead and go to new and then new folder now this folder we can call any kind of name I want to call my root folder since that's the technical term when it comes to a website folder we're going to say root folder again you can call it the website name if you want to like in my case have a website called mmm toots so I could call it mmm toots if I wanted to so inside this folder is what we're going to insert all the different documents and images and videos or any kind of media we might want to insert inside our website so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and open up my text editor which is Adam and as you guys can see with Adam when we open up the first time we will get a bunch of windows that we don't actually need so I'm going to go and close some of them so I'm going to go in close to welcome tack over here I'm going to close the telemetric on since which is over here I'm going to close the welcome guide so we only have the untitled page inside the editor now if you accidentally closed untitled page I'm going to create a new one by going to file and then say new file so inside this file we're going to insert the code which will end up being inside our front page of our website so this file here is going to be the actual page that we see inside the browser when you enter the website for the first time now the first thing we want to do is actually save the file so I'm going to click ctrl s or go to file and then save as and I'm going to save it inside my desktop folder called root folder so we need to make sure we insert all documents inside this folder called root folder now inside this folder I'm going to name this file index dot HTML and it's very important that you call it index.html if you were to go ahead and call it something like page dot HTML or front-page that HTML or home but HTML then it's not going to work you need to call it index dot HTML because that's the way the server when we do actually upload the website online can actually figure out which file is your front page so we need to call it index.html I'm going to save it and then as you guys can see we now get a project window on the left side and we still have the file over here on the right side now inside the project window can actually see on the document you have inside the root folder and this is one of the features that Adam provides as well as sublime text where you can actually see the documents inside the root folder so you can just open them up directly inside the side window here now if you want to close the side window you can click the arrow here and it doesn't that close now if you want to open it again you just click the arrow once more so the first thing you need to do inside the index file is actually tell the browser that this is in fact a HTML document now you might be thinking that because wrote HTML inside the name that the process should know that this is a HTML file but we do need to include some HTML tags inside the document in order for the browser to know that this is a HTML file now just to serve us a couple of examples of HTML tags this right here is a No opening tag and a closing tag inside HTML and again the name inside the actual tags will tell the browser what kind of content we'd write inside in between the tags so if you were to create something like a nav tag then we tell the browser that inside these nav tags we have a navigation okay so we use HTML tags in order to define what kind of content goes in between the tags and this is just a way for the browser to know what kind of content we have inside the website so the first thing we need to do like I said is actually tell the browser that were inside an HTML file and the way to do that is by creating a tag that looks like this lesser than exclamation mark duck type space HTML lesser than so this right here is a sort of special tag because like you guys can see we're not including any kind of closing tag afterwards we're just defining at the very top of the document that this is a HTML file and not just any kind of HTML file but the way we wrote if you actually tells the browser that this is a html5 document which is the latest version of HTML so after telling the browser that we're using html5 inside this document we're going to tell the browser when the HTML needs to start and when it needs to stop so we're going to create a pair of HTML tags that will have all the content of the page inside of it so we're going to say lesser than HTML greater than then we're going to go to the next line a couple of lines down I'm going to say lesser then forward slash HTML greater than so now as you guys can see when we want to close off the HTML tag we just include a forward slash in front of the actual name of the tag so any kind of content we put inside these tags will actually be content inside this HTML file so inside an HTML document we have two typical tags that all the content needs to be inside of inside the actual HTML tags created now these tags are called a head and a body tag now inside the head tag we're going to include stuff that we don't actually visibly see inside the browser such as we want to link to another document or we want to define something called meta tags which is just information about the website we don't access inside the website then we insert them inside the head tag now inside the body tag we insert content that we do actually see inside the website such as images text headers navigations that sort of thing all those things we put inside the body tag now just to serve as a shortcut inside atom and sublime text if you were to write head and then click tap then you guys can see we create the tags fast and we don't actually need to write the opening and a closing tag manually which is quite nice inside these programs here so I'm going to go underneath the head tags and I'm going to write body tap and then we have these tags as well so like I mentioned inside the body tags we can include content that we do actually see inside the website so in our example here we're going to write hello world which is sort of a tradition when it comes to writing code inside any kind of occasion so when you create your first application we can write hello world now inside the head tags like I said we don't actually see the content but we do need to have some information in here which is necessary in order for the website to have the program for mation that it needs in order to run inside the browser so the first thing we need to include is something called a meta tag now a meta tag like I explained is a tag that has some information in it and in this case we're going to include some information about what type of characters we want to use inside the website and the way we do that is for writing lesser than meta and then the closing tag now this is a meta tag but right now we have an X included any kind of information inside this meta tag so I'm going to go right after the name of the tag say space and then I'm going to write chart set is equal to double quotes then I'm going to say UTF dash 8 which basically covers all the characters we want to use inside any kind of typical web site so what we just did here is we included a name for the tag then included something called an attribute which gives them information about the tag which in this case is the character said we want to use inside the website which is equal to some kind of value okay so this is all we need in order to tell the browser that we want to use a specific set of characters inside the website now the next thing we're going to include the hit text which I'm going to include right above the meta tag is going to be a title tag now at the title tag will in fact have an opening and closing tag and just so you guys don't get confused the meta tag did not include a closing tag for and if you were to ask me about which tags do we or do we not include a closing tag for then I can just tell you that is something you have to learn along the way because not all tanks like the table up here what a meta tag will need a closing tag so it's just one of those things that you will learn along the way as you start programming okay so on top of the meta tag I'm going to include a title tag so I'm going to say title and then click tap and then as you guys can see we get a pair tags with some text inside of it now right now it says home as a default women did actually click tap so I'm just going to delete it and instead write the name of my website so in this case I could actually say something like hello world just to have it save it and all these tags would just include is you are going to be the default ones that we need to have every time you start a new page inside our website now just to kind of test it out because you haven't actually seen the page inside the browser if I were to go to my root folder then right click my index file go to open with and then open it with any kind of browser might have inside our computer and I'm just going to use Google Chrome here because that's the one I prefer to use so once I open it you guys will notice that we will have a piece of text that says hello world and inside the tab option in the top part we also have hello world now the hello world include up in the tab is going to be what we wrote inside the title here and the text of this inside active website right here is going to be the text we have down here inside the body tag okay so this is basically how to get started on creating the website in next episode we're going to talk about some different tags we have inside HTML so right now we learned about some couple of default ones that we needed to have in every single project or inside every single document so we're going to talk about some tags that we will be using along the way as we start creating a website so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time
