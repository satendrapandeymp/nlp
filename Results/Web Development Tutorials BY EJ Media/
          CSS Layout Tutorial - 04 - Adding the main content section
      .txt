welcome to the fourth video on CSS layouts in this video we're going to add the main section so let's get going so let's just go ahead and copy and paste here like we always do and now what we're going to do here is we're going to use a class instead of IDs and we're going to name this main and of course you'll remember in the previous series IDs are for specific elements that are unique but we're going to reuse this main content pane again so I want to use a class for this so let's go ahead and create some rules for our main class and we'll just do another copy and paste and we will rename this to dot main and you will remember that the dot signifies class so we are not going to use a hash tag here we're going to use a dot and we will keep the margins at ten pixels and we're going to get rid of the height property so we're going to have no height and no width and I'll explain that in a minute and we'll keep the border radius at five pixels and we're going to change the background color to a lighter color so it's going to be e 5e 4d 7 that's what we're going to use so let's go ahead and save this and let's add some padding here and remember that is the space between the border and the text and we'll make that 20 pixels now you can play around with this you can set this to 10 or 15 pixels you can test out which one you like the best but I'm going to use 20 pixels and then we're going to increase the font size up 10% so this is at 14 pixels so we're going to increase this by about 10% and remember this is an inheritance thing so this was set at 14 pixels and then we could increase that size based off what we set here so it allows us to easily change the size up here if we want so again we'll be at 110% so let's save everything we've got here and we'll save our index.html and let's open up our web page and you can see now we've got our nice section here now in the header and in the navigation section I didn't add any content but let's add some content here because we want some semblance of the layout so we'll do that right now so let's close this out now of course you will see that with no height and no with this is the default that we get here right this is what we get there's nothing in here but we're about to put some content so let's close this out and I've already typed this out so I'm just going to do a copy and paste here and I'll explain it so here we've got a heading that I created which is h1 we of course we talked about that in the last series and this is going to be a history site so I've decided to go ahead and talk about Hannibal and you can probably tell that I like history a lot so I type this all in and this is going to be our paragraph so we have our h1 heading and our paragraph that's going to go under it so let's save this and now let's open this up and you can see how this sized according to the content we have so that's why it's useful that in your main content section not to put a width or a height because it will always size appropriately to the content that you put in and that's kind of nice now here we set a fixed height because we don't want these to expand out but for the content because this area will be dynamic we'll be adding more and more content here we want this to size appropriately every time we put new content here and if I set a fixed height we'd have to reset the height every time so this makes it easier to maintain the site so one thing we want to do here is we want to go ahead and style that heading we've already expanded the size of the text and set that at 110% but now let's go ahead and style the heading so let's close this out and I already typed this out so we can just copy and paste in here and here's our h1 of course so we'll be styling the h1 element right here I'm going to increase the font size by 120 percent because we want the heading a little bit larger than the text in our paragraph so we'll put that at 120 now you can play around these percentages and get the percentage that you like and then I put in a color as kind of a red color so the heading really stands out so let's go ahead and save everything and we'll take a look at our new look and feel so let's go ahead and open this up and you can see now we've got this nice heading here now eventually what we're going to do is we're going to create a link for this for the main article so this is kind of like the the tidbit and then people will be able to drill into here and we'll expand out to a full page but this is our main page and we just want to give you a taste of what this article is about and actually we'll put some thumbnails in here later but you can see how this expands out nice so let's add some more content let's add like another article that we created so let's close this out and then let's go ahead and paste I already have this typed out again so we'll just copy and paste this in here and here you see now that I'm reusing the h1 now you can actually make this an h2 and then this would be a little bit smaller but I actually like to use that reuse the h1 because I like the titles to be the same size but you don't have to do that you can make this smaller if you want to so let's go ahead and save this and let's reopen this up and you can see that this sized again we've just added the content and it resized it and fit everything nice and neat right into here I don't have to adjust the height I don't have to adjust the width it does it nice and neat for us so that is going to be our main section now in the next video we're going to add a sidebar over here so this is going to be what's called the two column layouts kind of a classic layout so we're going to have a sidebar over here and in order to do that we're going to have to float our sidebar element now I will copy and paste this entire div into the message board so that you don't have to type all this out okay I will see you guys in the next video
