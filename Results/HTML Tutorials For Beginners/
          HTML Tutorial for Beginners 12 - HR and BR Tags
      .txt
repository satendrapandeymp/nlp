ah no people I am Sean from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 12 line breaks and horizontal rules now this is going to be a really really really quick lesson than just a couple of things I want to talk about before we go any further because I think they're quite nifty tags to know so we're just going to jump straight into the code editor and Here I am back in the index file and I've not changed anything since last time and the first thing I want to talk about are line breaks and line breaks are just a way of controlling whitespace on a web page so we can force some text onto a new line using a line break and the tag we use is a br but before I show you the br tag I'm going to save this and show you in a browser what it looks like currently and I'm going to scroll down to this little bit of text here under about us and you can see it's all on one line and that's because it's all in one Pete AGG if we go to the code you can see in this about Us section here that it's all within this P tag so there's nothing kind of controlling the whitespace within that P tag now if we go halfway to where this full stop is and I add a br tag that's saying put a break here put a line break at this by at this point so I'll save this and we'll open it up again in a browser scroll down and now you can see under this about or section after the full stop here we go on to a new line so that's what the br tag does the second thing I want to show you is the HR tag now the HR tag stands for horizontal rule and basically it's another way of kind of segmenting parts of a website so if you have a section at the top and then a section at the bottom and you want something kind of distinct between them to kind of separate those two parts we can use a char tag or a horizontal rule tag and I'm going to do this underneath first of all the kind of intro line here we sell the smelliest on the fish on the planet I'm going to put them our tag and then once again I'm going to put that under the navigation so we've got three distinct parts now we've got this top part here which is the banner and the intro text then we've got the navigation in the middle part then the bottom part is all this extra text here at the bottom so I'm going to save this out and view it once more in a browser and we can see now we've got these horizontal lines across the whole webpage here and again we can style these in CSS so you can make them look however you want and so there we go that's all there is to it we've got BR tags to control whitespace and go on to a new line within text and we've got a chart ax which stands for horizontal rules and we can use these to segment content so that's all there is to it in this lesson I told you it's going to be quick and in the next lesson we're going to be talking about the elusive div tag so I'll see you guys there and don't forget to comment if you have any questions like the video and subscribe I'll see you guys in the next lesson
