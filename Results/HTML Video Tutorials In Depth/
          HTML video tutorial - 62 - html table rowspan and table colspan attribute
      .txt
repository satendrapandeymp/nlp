hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss two important attributes of table cells those are row span and call span let's discuss before that I want to create a table something like this to create a 4 by 4 table in Microsoft Office we go to insert we go to table we select 4 by 4 and we click you can see that we got 4 by 4 table and I increase the height by dragging it down you can see that I got a 4 by 4 table to create same 4 by 4 table we are going to use table tag here I put some values like 0 0 0 0 0 just to show that there is an information in these cells I put zeros in all cells to create the same table what I do in notepad I use the table tag ta b le table opening tag then I say closing table tag in the table tag I need a TR tag then I say closing table row tag in the table row I am going to create a TD every TD has 0 as a information closing TD copy that and paste it down paste it down paste it down now we have a table one row has 4 cells if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have 0 0 0 4 columns are there but we cannot see any border and all let me set the border bibo rder border equal to 1 file save go to browser refresh and also I do not want any cell spacing so here I say see II ll s paci ng cell spacing equal to 0 file save go to browser refresh ok next thing is I want to increase the width W ID th width is equal to 640 pixels file save go to browser refresh you can see that 640 pixel width set to the table similarly I want to add three more rows so I need to copy this table row from here to here one file save go to browser refresh I got one more row control-v file save go to browser refresh they got one more row control-v file save go to browser refresh I got one more row that is good also I want to increase the height to increase the height I need to use the height attribute right I use height attribute I hit enter here I say heig HD height is equal to 480 pixels eyes use file save go to browser refresh you can see that height is increased it looks similar to this right now what I want I want to merge these four cells to merge these four cells in Microsoft Word what we do we right we select first four cells then we right-click and say merge cells you can see that it has merged the cells and it has put 0 0 0 hereby enter I don't need that I put only 1 0 you can see that it has merged all the 4 cells what happened here actually means it has took the first cell ok it stretched it to 4 columns and it has removed 2nd 3rd and 4th cells try to understand we are going to perform the same operation to do same thing in HTML what we do we go to first row we go to first cell we are going to stretch it to how many cells 4 cells how do we stretch we use call span option call span in double quotation you should give how many columns it should span one two three four columns so I give here for then I must turn should remove these T DS otherwise what happens I will show you file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the below rows are squeezed and this first cell of the first row is stretch to four columns and we have all these three cells available if we don't remove this behavior we see so what I do I remove this these three I say file save go to browser and refresh now we have the desired output whatever we expect we are getting so first thing what you need tell how many columns it should span then total call span - one cells you need to remove let's go further I want to merge these four cells so I select right click merge cells you can see that we merged and I put it here just 1 0 to perform this operation we have to follow the same thing right I think you people know now what to do for this to do I need to locate the 4th row go to the first cell say call span how many columns I should span I should mention 4 then I have to delete these three cells file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have call spanned now what I want I want merge these two cells I select these two cells right click and say merge cells you can see that these two cells got merged and we we want same behavior now what actually happened here means here browser went to the second row this is the second row it went to the second row it took the first cell of the second row and it stretched down by one cell and what it has done it has went to the third row and deleted one cell that is first cell of the third row we are going to perform the same operation let's go here to perform the same operation I have to go to the second row first cell to stretch it down or row wise we are going to use rowspan and we should mention how many rows it should span it should span two rows then I have to go to the third row I have to delete the first cell file save go to browser and refresh check that out I got to perform the same operation maybe over here what I have to do take an example I select this right click and say merge cells what I have to do now I have to go to the second rows last cell which is available I have two row span by two and delete last cell from the third row so I go to the second rows last cell I say here row span ro WSPA and row span how many cells two cells then I have to delete the last cell third rows last cell I have to delete I deleted that one file save go to browser and say refresh you can see that I got the desired output and also you can see all cells text aligned to middle vertical alignment is set to middle if I want I can set the vertical alignment to top by adding the V align attribute here I can go and say V a lig and align equal to top I can copy this V align top and paste for all cells give a space here also control V control V control V file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we got exact output as we have in the Microsoft Office hope you guys have understood how you can work with the rowspan and call span how you can get the desired and layout for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
