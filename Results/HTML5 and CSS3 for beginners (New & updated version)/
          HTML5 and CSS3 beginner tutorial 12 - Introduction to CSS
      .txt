hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 12 and in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to style your website using CSS so we're finally taking a look at CSS and if you guys can remember from the first video in the series I told you that CSS is how we style our website CSS gets to determine things like what font family were using what color text is going to be if we're gonna have background images or not all of that kind of stuff can be added with CSS and well now that I've given you a quick reminder let's take a look at my document here so right now it is a blank document I was just a blank template there's nothing in the body take a look at that in the browser it's just a blank file and if we look in my htdocs folder I just have one index file so there's nothing else so let me start showing you guys how to use CSS but before we do that we need to actually have some text or something to manipulate so I'm just gonna add a paragraph here and let's make it say something like style me right so let me save this come back over to the browser hit refresh and you can see it's showing nice and big because I'm zoomed in at 300% so that's what it would normally look like but let's just zoom in so I can show you guys just how to style this paragraph and also so that you guys can see a little bit more clearly right so there are three ways we can style elements on our page the first way is inline CSS the second way is an a style sheet that is embedded within our documents and then the second or the third way is an external style sheet so I'm going to show you the first two inline CSS and I'll show you style tags on our documents and then when that is in the next video I'm going to show you guys how do you use an external style sheet so taking a look at this element inline CSS is when you add an attribute to a specific element so let's add a style attribute and this will only style one element at a time it'll only style the element that you have made a style rule for so in this case it's gonna style this paragraph and I want to change the color of this text to blue right so within your style attribute there are a number of values that you can set there are really a large number of values but what I want to do is I want to grab a property the name for this thing is called a property called color and then I'm going to separate my property with a colon so its property : and then another value for whatever this this property should be equal to so those are big terms that you kind of need to get used to but don't be confused all were doing is changing the color to blue right now because I only have one style rule here I'm only changing the color it should work fine if I just save everything like this and come back over to the browser and hit refresh now you can see my paragraph has gone from black to blue I can also add a different style rule in here but I need to separate every single one of my style rules with a semicolon so I've put in a semicolon now let me add a second property over here that bird is really annoying okay let me add a second property here font size now let's go font family I'll change the font family and I'm going to change that to hell ticker I hope I spelled that right it turned blue I think I did so that's save and come back over the browser and hit refresh and now you can see the font has changed as well so that is how you use inline CSS if you ever want to style just one element at a time but this could be really annoying right because what happens if I've got a second paragraph that doesn't have these style rules and I also want this one to be styled well if it doesn't have the style rules it's gonna appear blank and unstyled right so I can apply I can write these style rules once and apply them to every single paragraph on my page by simply adding a style tag to the head so let's add a style tag over here and we'll have that of type is equal to text slash CSS that's just telling the browser that we're using CSS within the style tag I'm gonna go ahead and break that down a line and I want to place all my style rules over here so let's get rid of this style or styling and let's go ahead and place the exact same styling up here within the style tags so this is going to work slightly differently because now instead of of just adding a style attribute to a tag we've got to select the tag we want to style so in this case I want to style all paragraphs so I need to use a paragraph selector so that would in this case just be a simple P basically what what you do is you take the letter or the word that is in the tag that you want to style place that over here and then add in these two curly braces and you can break that down a line and this is now going to select all paragraphs on our website and it's going to style them with whatever style rule I place in here so let's grab a property of color and let's set that equal to red let me come back let me save this and I'll go back over to the browser and hit refresh and now you can see that with one style rule we've styled all of the paragraphs on our webpage so we only needed to type this in once I can also change the font family over here as well to help Vertica again let's go ahead and save come back over to the browser and hit refresh and there we go we now have all our fonts all our paragraphs on our website red and they have changed to Helvetica right now if I go ahead and add some normal text on a page like let's just add something outside of a PD tag right and I save this and hit refresh you can see that this text is not being styled because it is not part of a paragraph if I were to add a paragraph tag around this it would whoops it would suddenly get the styling as well so that is just pretty much how CSS works and the last thing I want to show you guys is styling weight because you have our styling sheet or our style tags up at the top of our page in the head but we can also add our inline CSS again if a pace that where is it there okay if I paste this back into my tag you can see that I I now have my inline CSS and I've also got my style - of stock style tags open so which one of the Styles do you think is going to apply well there's this thing called weight CSS weight and what happens is certain CSS can be heavier than other CSS that's how you got to think about it and in this case our style tags at the top of our head and it's applying to all paragraphs so it has a weight but it's not as heavy as an inline style styling rule like this so inline styling rules a lot lot heavier and in that case because we've got an inline styling rule to change the font the color of this text to blue this is going to override this because this is heavier so let's save come back over to the browser and hit refresh and you can now see that we have a red paragraph which was styled by the text up here and in fact this paragraph was also styled by the text up yet but then it was overwritten because an inline style sheet or an inline style tag has more weight and so it was overwritten therefore turning this tag blue and then we have unstyled text that's just nothing applied to because we didn't use inline styling and we didn't use a selector to select this text and I hope that was clear we are going to be taking a look at CSS more in the future so hopefully you can just practice and play around with this try and understand it and in the next video we are going to be doing this again actually so until then I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now why you're still here there are a few things that you can do
