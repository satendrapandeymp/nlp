alright guys in the last tutorial what I did is I basically told you guys that what we can do with html5 is taking website and basically treat it like a desktop application where we can take images icons drag them over and actually pop them down in other places and make stuff happen so I guess I might as well put my money where my mouth is in this tutorial and actually show you guys how to do it so what I want to do first is I want to build a function like we did last time that occurs right when the window or in other words the web page is done loading so what I'm going to do is pull window add event listener and the one thing I don't like about notepad plus plus is whenever you like type something wrong it should put a little underline under it but anyways it's cool program nonetheless so basically as soon as our window loads what I want to do is I want to call a function called do first and this function is a function that we didn't make it and just go ahead and put false there because remember the rule just about false all the time unless I tell you differently so now what I want to do is since we call this do first function we actually have to build it so function do first and it's not going to take any parameters is just going to do something and all this function is going to do again this is basically going to fire off as soon as our web page is done loading so what we want to do is we want to set all of our initial variables and by that I mean we want to reference everything for example on this picture right here I'm just going to go ahead and grab the ID copy and basically whenever we reference it through JavaScript it's going to know we're talking about that picture so let's go ahead back into JavaScript and first thing we need to do is give it a variable name my pick and let's just go ahead and set this equal to document and remember since this is in this file right here we're talking about this document so document get element by ID and the ID of that was face pick just like that so now what we want to do is on this picture right here remember this variable my pic references this thing right here right now so what I want to do is I actually want to add in event listener for my pick so my pick go ahead and copy that just going to go ahead and copy this or mine as well you see how lazy I am and now I'm going to add some event listeners so you say okay Bucky you're probably going to add an event listener for low do you want something to happen as soon as that picture is done loading no no no what I want to do is I want to add an event listener called drag start now this event listener kicks off whenever you start to drag your image so as soon as I start to drag this that's when a function is going to be fired so again drag start is a special keyword that's spilling the JavaScript so you you like can't change this or anything you need to use the keyword drag start and it's basically event that happens whenever you start to drag something so it's saying okay whenever you start to drag my pick what do you want to happen well we want to call a function called start drag now this function isn't built-in already this is what we're going to customize so we're going to need to build that one later on and of course the third parameter is false remember the rule always put false unless I tell you otherwise so now what we need to do is we actually need to reference something else so we already have a reference to my pick which is this right here now we need a reference to this left box this blue box right here so in order to do that just like before we're just going to go ahead and I'm just going to cheat a little bit here copy this and instead of my pick just go ahead and put left box and what was the ID for the left box oh that's convenient that's why you name things what they are so they aren't confusing at all so now in JavaScript we have a reference to left box through the variable left box so now I never use this variable remember we're talking about this blue box aka I named it the left box you can name it the blue box but maybe we're changing the color or later on so anyways enough of me rambling on so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be adding three event listeners for the left box so let's just go ahead and copy that in hit left box add event listener and I actually could have copied this thing in I get so mad whenever I could have done something the lazy way and actually did it the hard way so like I said we're going to be adding three event listeners the first one is something called drag enter and let me just go ahead and set the rest my parameters now since I'm going to be doing something soon so drag enter is basically when something enters the area so basically when something enters here that's what's going to happen whenever we use this one and what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be copying this and showing you guys two other events that we're going to listen for so we want to call a function whenever something enters the area we want to call a function whenever we drag something over the area so this basically is called one time well I'm don't worry about this for now and the last one is drop in I'm just going to do this so drag enter and drag over you're saying well we're going to have to write a bunch of customized functions but the only thing we're worried about is we don't care what happens when we drag over this or enter the area because that isn't you know what we're worried about for this tutorial maybe when you're building a program on your own you want it to highlight or something whenever you're dragging over but the only two events I care about is whenever we start dragging I want something to happen and whenever we drop it in here I want something to happen so saying okay then why don't you just get rid of these completely drag enter and drag over if you don't even want anything to happen well because of this and listen very carefully because this is actually kind of important by default you know how they're a bunch of different browsers like Google Chrome Safari Opera Internet Explorer they each have a default action that occurs whenever you drag over something Google Chrome might do nothing like it is right now Internet Explorer might highlight this div opera might turn it purple or something to know that you're hovering over it well what we want to do is say okay since we're building this website and we want to make it the same through all user experiences we want to have the same action so we're going to override this by making a function inside here then you put a in there because this means whenever you have a always means event so the event is basically that eve area Belen firm ation on that event so for the code that we write in here those are going to be curly braces actually we want for the event prevent default and remember what this means is basically if you have any default action that occurs for instance making it you know highlight it or anything like that just prevent it just don't do anything instead in through this we're basically saying okay whenever we explicitly write this we overwrite it and therefore it's the same across all browsers so remember like I said instead of calling a function that we can write later on just go ahead and copy this code and now nothing can happen and that just makes it compatible across all browsers gives the users the same experience no matter what they're using so basically the only thing we're doing is we want to call the start drag function whenever they start to drag the image and whenever they drop the image into this box we're going to be calling a function called dropped so those functions are not built into JavaScript we actually need to build them explicitly so that is where we're going to be doing in the next tutorial so to recap one last time if you got everything then go ahead and move on to the next story but I know this is kind of confusing so I'm going to recap it one more time what we did is we referenced this picture through a variable called my pick now with my pick we can add an event listener on it so basically our website is going to be waiting until we start to drag that and whenever we start to drag it it's going to call a function called start drag that we're going to be making in the next tutorial after that we referenced left box which is this blue box right here through JavaScript variable and then we said okay browser if you have any default thing that you do whenever they enter or drag over this area like right here do it just go ahead and you know prevent default and this is actually a built-in function that we got with html5 it pretty much means don't do anything at all so it's like okay if you highlighted it by default don't even worry about doing that at all the only thing that we need to do is whenever we drop it into that box we're going to call a function that is called dropped and that's where we're going to be building in the next tutorial so again in the next story we're going to work on start drag and drop and then our application is complete so for now thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys in the next video
