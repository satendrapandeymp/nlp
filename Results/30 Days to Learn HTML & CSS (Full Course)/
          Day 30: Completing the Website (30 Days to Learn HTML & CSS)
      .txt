in the previous lesson we covered quite a bit we built the layout so today we just need to finish up by tweaking our site and adding the layout for one of the other pages which is going to be much easier to do so let's start with some tweaks the first thing I see here is I would like the footer to have some more breathing room right here just so it's not right underneath so we could apply some margin top to the footer but you might find that that doesn't work but still we'll try it margin top and we'll do a hundred pixels just to demonstrate when I'm referring to refresh and it's not working so this may happen to you you'll wreck your Brian trying to figure out why and if you hover over it look how footer seems to be coming all the way up well that's odd you might be thinking well we need to clear it but it's already being cleared so what you need to do is see if anything above it is being pushed to the bottom hover over main and notice that main if you look at the tooltip has a height of 0% and remember Maine's children are all floated so that means we need to use the clear fix class to make sure it clears or contains all of its children when a refresh and now if I hover over it can you see that has been cleared and now if we scroll down we are recognizing that huge margin that we applied good so that was an easy fix let's bring this down to around 30 pixels of margin and the next thing I notice is that we went through creating the buttons quite quickly why don't we spend a little more time the first thing I notice is they're all caps they're white this appears to be bold and it seems that he might have just a little bit of shadow so let's revise our button I'm going to search for button and now I'm going to set the color to white make it bold and then text transform to uppercase reload and that's really large so I see two options one will be to reduce the font size or remove that entirely and maybe he didn't use font weight and yeah maybe he didn't use bold but I am going to add the font size and bring that down to 12 pixels or possibly even 11 there we go and I think that looks good the last thing is now when we hover over it because we were turning the color white we don't have any transition at all so why don't we make the background color slightly different but remember when we hover over an anchor the colors black so that won't display at all as you can see right there so let's keep color white on because it seems we need it and now we have a subtle transition if you want to make it more you can always do that as well but I think that's fine for what we have so this is all we're going to do for this homepage what I would recommend you do if you had a real client project is you would want to make sure that your fonts line up here he's using special fonts notice that this looks better than what we have here and the only difference is he is using all lowercase and we are not and second he's using a much cleaner and a thinner font so you would then want to go to either font squirrel or google fonts or use a background image with this exact font embedded it's up to you but we're not going to get into it today now I'm going to close this out and we're going to load the other page PSD s and I'm going to open up work dot PSD and this one's a little bit different but it's more or less the same structure so let's create our new file first things first close that CSS and add a new file called work HTML next I need to make sure I linked to work right here so I will go to work HTML and next I'm going to copy all of this over if you're working with a server-side language which you presumably will in the future you wouldn't do this you would abstain to a file and your header into a file but in this case we don't have that option now I'm going to update the title to work and let's see if we are linking to it correctly click on work and now we are on this new file now we need to update it for this PSD so we can see right off the bat we have these two big images and the grid is much wider because it's divided into two we know that it should be grid twelve so that's the first step I'll come in here into this new file and we don't have a banner so we can get rid of all of that and now within the main section we're going to have a grid of 1/2 of 24 is 12 I will get rid of the read more button and then I'm going to take all of this and duplicate it because we do have to then I don't need anything else that follows after here X for the footer there we are that looks pretty good so let's view this in the browser reload and already we have the basic structure in place now we just need to slice out any assets that we require and in this case all we have are two images I'll select it make sure that auto-select layer is on click the image and now once again I'm going to click the mask that way I can copy the image and now you should know this process if you've been working along save it as a JPEG and here I'm going to call it work one and I'm going to do the exact same thing once again with this second photo and what I see here is when I select it it seems that I'm also picking up something else so we can reduce from a selection by choosing the marquee tool and coming right up here and this is reduce or subtract and now I'll just select anything I want to subtract wherever that's coming from there we go save it and that will be saved this work too now I can add those into my project so let's see where to place it it should be at the top of each grid as you can see right here so for now I'm going to do image and we're going to go to IMG work one and I'll duplicate this and do the same thing for the next one but work too this time let's see that there's our two images good now we're going to come back and add some of this extra text and it looks like he has a heading two of work example one so I'm going to save myself some time below the image I'm going to use double cursors by selecting command and click but this is only available in sublime so if you're working along you'll have to do this manually work example one and then I'll just update this one to two and then we have the same thing here just a little bit of text so I will copy that and we'll place that maybe within a paragraph tag wherever you want and it looks like I accidentally put that on top so I'll fix that place it below and if we come back to the PSD I'm thinking that could probably be a subheading so why don't we come back I don't like to use paragraphs unless I have to so let's select each of these peas and change it to perhaps an h3 or maybe even an h4 refresh and now we have work example one and a brief description so all we have to do to finish up the Paige is do a little bit of styling also we want to adjust the selected page from home to work examples we'll do that first because it's easy come to the top and remove a class of selected to home and we're going to place it with work examples reload now that's been updated next that is to do the font styling for what we have right here so let's find out what the sizes he's got 26 pixels and what do we have if we inspect our element we have our set to 23 so we would want to make that bigger so how do you adjust an h2 for one page but have it be different on another page and a common way to do this is to apply a special class to the body element in this case we'll do work and that way if there are any discrepancies we can adjust those another way to do this would be to wrap each section so you have main but then each of these are stored within grid 12 and that's it why don't you give it a class of work and then we can use this work namespace of sorts to target these specifically and that's what I'm going to do here at the bottom create a new divider called work and now I can say work h2 font size is twenty six pixels and I don't have to worry about affecting anything else good now I want to adjust the spacing below the images above if we come back to our code we can see that right after here we have our image so we will place it right here work image margin bottom and I'm just going to estimate at this point 20 pixels and that pushes it down good next we have this subheading so I'll select it and get this color 78 78 and we're going to attach that so if you wanted to make that all h4 tags you could do that it just depends on your website if that's always going to be the color for h4 keep it generic if it's special to this work section limit it to just that class refresh and now we have that lowered also there's no spacing at all here but there is right here and that's because of those margins that we have set if we set margin bottom to zero watch what happens it jumps up next I don't think there's any bold here so we're going to reduce that font-weight:normal and we're going to apply that to the h4 as well so why don't we do this H 2 and H 4 like so reload and there we go that looks a lot better let's next figure out is the font size the same and it appears to be 26 pixels and the same with the heading so we can take this out and we can put this like so refresh and that's looking better but still I think there's too much spacing compared to what they have so what I'll do to fix that since we already zeroed out our margins is perhaps we'll go to the h4 and just push it up a touch by doing negative margin this is always option if you need to and that pushes it up and it looks like I didn't get this full text so I'm going to copy that one more time and paste that in for each one there we are and reload the page okay so now let's make sure everything is right and I'm thinking that the line height right here is going to be less than what we have and you see here Auto that's essentially one and we probably have it set to higher so what if we set line height to 1m to see what auto or regular would be and you see that pushes up and that also shows that the line height was set or inherited from another element which is what was creating that extra spacing now that I know that I can remove this margin top which is always nice there we go that looks good and then at this point you can modify the line height however you need and here it does seem to be a little bit higher and there is a border below it so let's fix that line height maybe one point two four door bottom is going to be that same divider color you can even if you find yourself using this divider often abstracting that away to its own class next I'm going to set up what the spacing is below this and it should be the same as what we've done before and it appears we have 33 pixels right here so we'll say padding-bottom 33 pixels and then what about the margin after that that seems to be a little higher as well 30 pixels so that will be represented by margin refresh and there you go and we're more or less done with this page so again if you were doing this for a real-world and a client you need to make sure that those fonts will be the same because he is using nice font here and you can see it really does make a good bit of difference when you have it thin and crisp font as opposed to our default Helvetica or Arial so now if we want to get back to the home page we haven't set that link up yet that's our last step home is going to go to index.html and now we have created a two page website there's home have your nice layout you would adjust the fonts for your projects and then you can link to work examples and it looks great and we were able to do this in just a couple hours and I hope you are working along with me now that we've built your first website we need to deploy this and the first step you need to do is figure out what is your domain there are lots of ways to purchase a domain name you can google it one of the most popular of course is GoDaddy a lot of people hate it but tons more use it I've used it myself it's fine for what I need but if you'd rather use something else feel free right here you can search for the domain name that you want once you find it go ahead and purchase it next that is you need hosting and there's lots of providers hundreds upon hundreds the one I use and I like a lot is called media temple so you can contact them or research it on your own time you could sign up and it's generally going to be around 15 to 20 dollars a month for the grid hosting which is all you need so once you have created a domain gotten your hosting you would want to log in and in this case I will use my own credentials you'll get to see my personal info and then we would add a new domain add a new domain or service and in this case we don't want to add a new grid service we simply want to add a zone because we already have hosting and we just purchased a domain name so we'll add this domain and this is where you would place the URL to the domain that you purchased it would select I already own this click the next step follow the instructions and then you're all set up and once you've done that and gotten all set up the next step is to FTP your files up there are lots of different ways you can do this you can search for free FTP clients and you'll find FileZilla is very popular you can use that there are browser FTPS there are programs one that I like to use on the Mac is called transmit and this allows me to save common places that I go to I think it works really well but it's not free again you can get a free trial by visiting panakam slash transmit all right so with that out of the way let's connect to my web host next you can see I have various folders in here I'm going to create a new folder and we'll call this my website and login so you would do the same thing but accessing your FTP account using the credentials that you can get from your web host they will usually email you and what you log in to your root folder or any folder you want you're going to drag in everything we worked on so I'll select everything except for the PS DS because those are large files and they're not necessary and pull them over now I simply browse to this URL so in my case I stored it on prefix er com slash my website and that our website is now on the web you can give this to anyone it's going to work anywhere and it really wasn't that hard to get on the web if we decide to make a change you simply edit the file here when you're finished you drag that change to file over and it will instantly be updated on your web host we can go to our pages make sure everything works there's work and there's home last step is now that we know that we can upload our files and it will work you want to do your final bit of testing and this is where you're going to view this website and all of the modern browsers and this is going to include firefox chrome Chrome and Safari are generally going to be the same but still check them and Firefox you can see it's more or less the same and this is an advantage that you have being new back in the day it really wasn't always this way you could view something in Firefox and it wasn't quite the same in chrome and you had to figure out what the differences were and how to fix that these days the browsers are quite modern and they are following best practices so you would continue to view this in Firefox Chrome Safari Opera if you like though usage and Opera is only about 2% it's pretty small and then you'd want to check this in Internet Explorer 9 8 and potentially 7 if you want to support a browser that's two versions back that one's up to you if you have access to Windows that's the easiest way open your windows computer access the URL that you've uploaded by FTP and see if there are any issues now if you are on a Mac you can use a virtual computer now there's also a website called browser stack that's relatively new this will allow you to run cross-browser testing right now it's in private beta but probably by the time you watch it you'll be able to use it and it gives you access to all of the various Internet Explorer's and lastly make sure that you validate your code to see if you missed any HTML closing elements so we'll do that right now before we finish up I will visit validator w3.org and I will select more options and make sure we're using an html5 doctype and specify the address and see if there are any errors and we passed perfect the last thing is let's validate our CSS as well so I will click it right here and now we're going to pass a path to not index.html but CSS style that CSS is where that's stored as you can see check it and this will let us know if there are any errors and you can see right here there are two too many values recognized on the line 138 so let's view it line 138 and what's happening right here is it's not an error but this validator does not understand RGB a so we know that is correct we can ignore that one and it's because we're testing with CSS level 2 instead of level 3 and the same thing right here unknown pseudo element or pseudo class last child we know we can do that the validator just does not understand it so don't simply change your code for the sake of passing it we're using this as a test and our tests show that we've done everything right so we are finished with our first simple website
