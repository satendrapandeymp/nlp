already in HTML videos please refer the videos which are there in HTML level before you are entering into today's video session now today I am discussing advanced reforms completely related to web 2.0 so these advanced reforms are completely related to HTML 5 environment so related to that already some definition some kind of nodes if I already displayed on the television set but before that let me define what is the form from popularly known as HTML form or web form form is a container it can hold some other control and it transfer when user click on the submit button the values are transferring to the concerned destination that is only we are calling action attribute now form related information means 1.0 already completely 12.0 in 2.0 web 2.0 suggested a new version of the World Wide Web it does not refer it does not refer to an update so any technical specification it's completely includes social networking websites blogs wiki's sharing video related websites web applications different different things are there but when you are coming to web 2.0 level and what WC organization specified all these things what WG means web hypertext application technology working group already in HTML 5 position I may that very clearly so this organization brought these all these features in the form of web forms 2.0 now I am coming to these input types existed here these all input types related to these characteristics this different variety of input types available sliders number spinners placeholders pop-up calendars auto completing like the different different things available but in a new values means new input types existed these are the total 13 new input types color did daytime daytime local means a date picker is available here general Pickers available together 13 again date pickers we can fill six and seven general Pickers first will complete the date pickers then I will come back to general Pickers but first try to view what are the components presented in front of you all these are built in JavaScript the feature really when the rocking feature one of the rocking features in html5 environment all these input types without writing a single JavaScript statement we can do marvelous outputs and I was simply effectively efficiently we can able to do that kind of information practical I will show you first let me execute date pickers one-by-one so first read that color date daytime daytime local email month the number range such parallel time URL week so two types I said and one note point all say provided for your comfort purpose what that when all the way there web browsers are supporting all input types if any input type not a supporting that behave like a regular text field is there is a perfect not point for you guys try to try to understand once again the note point your mistake is not there if not supporting that is a browser related plugins are not there are rated libraries are not there so that time compulsory please update your browser latest version so that all these examples of Tivoli executed come down to date because so what are the date pickers existed yes six as I said already day to day time day time local then month time week so these date because one-by-one practically in this video session we can try to view first a date so ultimate this input type allows the user to display date in mm DD yyy format means for wife so 2017 or 2016 like their formats it is going to display and once if you are coming to our source code area I am developing directly what is input type is equal to date so before I am going to start my soul sport some standards required come on out standard frequency right yes already structure a type completely so including your header part and close in between title I type and meta care set commonly we are giving for the Unicode content and body available right inside body tag our form yes so commonly existed action need you can't destination from destination just anyone I am giving my local thing generally we are giving in the live environment ASP JSP PHP related faces we are giving server-side and commonly form has a name as per the standard name is equal to my form example purpose ID is equal to form one great now come down label so first and I am giving select valid date and the label close right input type is equal to yes date is our input type actually a required name also Java C purpose I'm not writing anything just standard how to maintain I'm showing in prototype is equal to submit value is equal to next page again reset also I am writing input a type is equal to reset double quotation you can use single quotation you can use no issue already in previous video sessions I made very clearly that select validate so break tag is there let me refresh so you want to apply a little bit color you can apply using style tag mmddyy why why okay good now for example I clicked on that marvelous January 2017 and displayed the current one for example I selected 25 great first month 25th to date 2017 and different different gadgets available symbols here you can observe and if you click on this once again if you click this calendar will see here 999 in years the calendar to 9999 years the calendar without writing a single line JavaScript code how much marvelous feature at least one second you can think that is the reason html5 that much demand right now in the market you did a small thing the small thing is appearing no I want to see that again definitely click on that and pull down this once you are pulling down this this area and automatically you come to know what are the things available here right let me pull that let me pull that right and here existed test I am shopping up to 2,000 90 I scroll down like that if you scroll you can see 9999 otherwise how to display in upcoming examples I will show you that now you want to make little bit colorful style is the equal to color blue great I and you want to add some kind of fun family add that font family home and now once you are entering into that again you can click so this one also you can change ddmm by Y we can change Y by mm DD r YY y by mm DD like that any format we can change by using javascript by default we are following American format mmddyy using javascript customization is possible so right now built-in features I am showing to you this is one of the best features from html5 that is date let me move to date time the second control so date time completely displaying time John including time zone available the time zone commonly we are calling as UTC universal time code sorry incorrect that one coordinated Universal time the perfect aful form and GMT Greenwich Mean Time always we are 5 are 30 minutes forward you want to see that you can go to your windows date and time settings just click on that once if you are going there click on time zone and we are here UTC format and just click on the drop down and you will get every information related to coordinated Universal Time UTC mean now you are going to view more things here where plus available the timezone is forward where - available the time zone is a backward where no plus no - that is equally UTC so just by going to your windows date and time settings you can view that right I am closing the date and time settings and come back how we are implementing this one select date and time date and time simple I provided save it now DTM so date type name anyone named as per your convenience you can change as per your business rules you can change their time so just we are going to take I am NOT disturbing the existing one same I am running on another web browser this is already is there already me develop a date so I want to show you on Mac right so this is another browser from Apple Safari let me serve Apple Corporation suffer so select a valid date and time timezone actually just I am clicking that observe 2017 YY and mmm and DD T for time Jetta for Joan right now as of you are seeing my video so in this in this time in this video recorded time in UK early morning 555 means five hours 55 minutes now in UK so timezone is that now as per is T my timezone is that 1125 you can calculate perfectly five hours of 30 minutes 24 seconds will come so this is called time zone so we can display time zone related calendar controls

spirituality that were also we can see month of spirituality is always displaying a month a year yes that I made very clearly R month and year right we come back here month and year area so remove that whatever existed date time local available write the name MN select a valid month and the year month and year save it refresh yes excellent so this is a month and year to select for different different types of controls existed for a different patterns but previously all these are not possible only html5 doing that wonder know that point I am NOT saying in html5 level simply we can do
