welcome back guys welcome to your 43rd tutorial and in this story I'm going to be talking about another form element and this element is actually called a text area now a text area the most simple way I can put it is you know those single line text fields that we had before it's just a big text field now what is the point of having you know a text area then well certain times when you're making forms you're going to kind of want to push your user in leaving more than a single line of text for example um if they're like on a dating website and they need to leave a biography about themselves or maybe they're posting an ad on eBay and they need to write a description about their item this takes more than a single line of text so whenever you want the user to enter like one word give them a single line of text but whenever you want to have them enter like a couple paragraphs you're going to need to give them a text area so that's where we're going to be doing in this tutorial so the first thing that I want to teach you guys is exactly how to add that text area and you do that by using the tags can you guys guess text area and you also end it with can you guys guess this text area now of course just like every other tag it and I really talked about every other form element it takes the name and let's go ahead and make that dating website we'll have this area be the biography and by the way by default it has you can have text in it like type something here and whenever you save this and refresh it that is the text that appears in the text area but in general you probably want to put something about it like tell me about yourself right there so now woah actually not right there embarrassing so tell me about yourself and then go ahead and add the line break so it doesn't look weird and refresh it and check it out so this would be you know the startup of awesome dating website where you know you I know up and now you got to fill in your biography telling them bragging about yourself and you know how much money you make and how good your eyes look so you know you can go ahead and delete this and start typing but you know you're the designer of this website and you say this is not nearly enough space for me to brag about myself I need this to be wider and taller well thank God you got me because I'm going to show you how to do that unlike height and width this attribute is a little bit different it's actually made up of rows and columns now the exact size of these rows and columns I'm not even sure of myself but I think they differ from browser to browser but anyways for if you want it to be taller you nee need to change the height of the rows I think it must be like 2 by default so let's go ahead and push up to 8 and now let's save this in refresh and check it out our text area now gets why is this little thing right here whoa I didn't even know you could do that that must be something new in Google Chrome that's pretty cool this is my first time figuring this out anyways by default you see that the rows get taller really texting me in the middle of its toriel let's see who it is and Bear Singh I'm not even going to tell you guys who that was because it is too embarrassing actually so anyways rows changes the height of it and change the width of it just go ahead and put C OLS this stands for columns but who the heck wants to type out columns evidently not the people who made this up so let's go ahead and change this to 40 or something and save it and see what we got refresh it and now it's 40 columns however long a column is wide so now you can see that this is probably enough area for me to give them a good biography about myself so what can I say to persuade the ladies to date me um well my name is Bucky and I have an overactive bladder that would probably persuade them and then I'll you know drawn the punch line want to get dinner sometime so this is usually when I go out that's the line I usually use and it works about 100% of the time so you know if you ever get stuck you can use my line so you're welcome for teaching you about text areas and you're also welcome about giving you a good pickup line whenever you go out to clubs and stuff so anyways that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial so I thank you guys for watching now you know about text areas now you can move on you have my blessing so yeah don't forget to check out my website check out my other videos and I'll see you next video
