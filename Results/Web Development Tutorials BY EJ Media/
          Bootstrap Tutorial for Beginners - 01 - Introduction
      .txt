welcome to the very first video on bootstrap I have had a lot of requests to do a series on bootstrap and so I have decided to do just that now what is bootstrap bootstrap is an open source framework that allows you to build websites and the good thing is it's free and open source so you can basically use it to design your websites and your web applications now what is a framework in case you don't know it's a set of tools that allows you to simply do something very complex that's basically what a framework is and usually what it does is it extends the functionality of existing software's so if you take a look at JavaScript and jQuery jQuery is a classic framework it extends the functionality of JavaScript and that's what bootstrap does it extends the functionality of HTML CSS and JavaScript now bootstrap was first developed by Twitter and they were nice enough to make it open source now what does it offer quite a lot and these are just a few of the points that I'm going to make it's the CSS part of bootstrap the CSS framework is very flexible and easy to use and the good thing is it's already been tested out a lot of the code that they provide has already been tested so you don't have to do any testing you can make a reasonable assumption that the code provided in bootstrap is going to work very nicely the major thing that bootstrap provides is a grid system for your website layout and it usually comes in a 12 column grid and it's very very responsive that's the nice part about it but you can also use a fixed grid so you can either use the fixed grid or a responsive grid and we'll talk about that in the coming videos now I want to point out that a lot of people think that bootstrap is just a template or just this grid system but it's not it offers a lot more it has a lot of components that you can use and we'll be covering that it offers labels buttons dropdowns navigation bars all sorts of components that you can use even in an existing website so again there's a little bit of a misconception out there that somehow this is just some sort of grid system it is not it offers lots and lots of components so the prerequisites for this series are HTML and CSS if you do not know anything about HTML or CSS you need to go my channel page and take those beginning tutorials because we are not going to cover the basics of HTML and CSS so once again if you don't know anything about HTML and CSS you need to go take those series first before you start the bootstrap series because this is really an extension off of those series it will also be helpful to know JavaScript now javascript will not be the main focus of this bootstrap series bootstrap provides some nice JavaScript plugins so again javascript is not necessarily a prerequisite but it will be nice if you know that as well okay that's going to do it for this introductory video in the next video we will download and setup bootstrap
