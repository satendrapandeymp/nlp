welcome to HTML tutorials this is lesson number 29 and in this lesson we're gonna talk about what a character set is so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that you want to do is make sure that you have the previous document open from the previous tutorial and once you have that open let's go ahead and get started before we actually do anything in our HTML document I'm first going to explain what a character set is a character set is basically a set of alphanumeric information for helping your web page to display correctly in other words we could have the letters A through Z and any of those letters could be used on our web site we can have the numbers 0 through 9 and any of those numbers can be used on our web site so basically anything that falls within that character set is allowed to be used on the web site so for example if you only had the letters B through Z then you would never be able to use the letter A on your website if we only have the numbers 1 through 9 you would never be able to use the number 0 so that's the importance of a character set it basically has a set of information in terms of alphanumeric information that you'll be able to use within your website and the web browser is going to use that character set to determine what type of information you can display in terms of text on your website so now that you kind of understand what a character set is we're going to go ahead and write the meta tag for a character set so to do that we want to click after one of our meta tags within our HTML document so look for the last meta tag that we wrote and we're going to click right after that so that we keep everything in the proper section in this case you're gonna write your meta tag in the head section so I'm gonna click right after the last meta tag and then I'm going to write angle bracket then the word meta and then we're going to write aah TMO attribute in this case we're going to write char set and that stands for a character set and then we're going to write equals and then in quotes in capital letters UTF - eight and that's one of the names for a character set in this case we're using UTF - 8 because it usually includes most of the characters and symbols in the world and you're gonna get most of your value out of using the UTF - 8 so char set stands for character set equals UTF - 8 and that's just the name of the character set that we're using and this is a HTML attribute in this case the name is char set and the value is UTF - 8 now there are many other character sets that you can use but I recommend you use UTF - 8 if you're dealing with html5 but if for some reason that it's different at the time of recording this video may be things change in the web design sector then you want to research and find out what character set you should be using for the particular time period so once you have that in quotes we're gonna go ahead and write our ending angle bracket hit ctrl s and we're going to save that now for the character set you're not going to see anything on the front end of the website when someone views your site they're not gonna know that you're using a character set for you - f - 8 this is something that shows up on the back end so I'm not gonna actually go to the web browser and preview this so I hope this video was helpful in helping you understand what a character set is and don't forget to embed comment share and subscribe and stay tuned for future videos on HTML have a great day
