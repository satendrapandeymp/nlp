I am going to talk about HTML layout with developments before going to start let's have a look what we are going to make at the end of this video you can see we have a web page which has header left sidebar main content right sidebar and footer portions actually I made this web page completely using deep elements so let's begin my cold our development start with Dave and ends with slash team so inside the div I will write ID and give this division a name main and then I will have some Styles so I'll write style background color and I want to give a fixed width and height to my division so I will give a width of 700 pixels height of 600 pixel save the page or document go to the browser refresh the browser and now you can see you have a rectangular box or division which has nothing so from now onward I will create another five division inside this division which I will call header left sidebar content right sidebar and footer so let's begin with our secondary divisions I'll create another division of the give it an ID header I will style it background color I'll give a width of 700 pixel to my header and height of 100 pixel and inside this division I will write header because usually in the header position you write your website name I'm going to write hitter and I forgot to close the division so I write /t save that document or HTML file go to the browser and refresh it and now you can see we have a header portion in our web page so in this way if I create another division called left sidebar inside this main division then we can get our left sidebar content portion right sidebar and footer portion so let's do it but I'm not going to write the code again so I'm going to copy the header divisions code and paste it here and I am going to change it where it is necessary so left sidebar I'm going to change the ID and the background color too so we have a fixed width in our main division of 700 pixels so now we have to decide that how much we want to give to our sidebars in the content areas I'm going to give my left sidebar 150 pixel and I'm going to do the same thing for my right sidebar so I will give 400 pixel to my content area and as you can see that our main division have a height of 600 pixel and we already gave our header 100 so and I am locating 100 pixel for my footer portion so we have only 400 pixel left for the left sidebar so I'm going to give 400 pixel height to my left sidebar and I will change the header text to left sidebar and another thing I will do here it is float:left okay so so i copy the same code for the content area and the right sidebar area and change where it is necessary content background ol white weight 400 pixel height 400 pixel okay float:left and the text should be main content and the right sidebar area right side bar background color is okay with 150 pixels okay height 400 pixel float:left okay right cycler and now here comes the code for our footer division so change the ID to footer background color what should i do for this one okay six six nine eight FF and the footer with 700 pixels and the height is 100 pixel there is no need of this plot of footer section I'm going to delete it here is the footer text I think this is all about our HTML div elements tutorial I'm going to sift up document HTML page whatever you say refresh the browser and now you can see we have a web page which has a header portion left side the portion main content right sidebar and footer area and I made this website completely using only developments in HTML that's all for this video thank
