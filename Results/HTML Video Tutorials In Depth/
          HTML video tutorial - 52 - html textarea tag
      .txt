hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss text area text area is also one of the most important control of forms when we create text area we create text areas when we need to get multiple line text for example if we want to get the address of an applicant we need to create text area if you want to get feedbacks or remarks or queries from users then we need to create text areas text areas allow us to get multi-line text inputs ok let's get started I write a paragraph here I want to get the address from the applicant so I'm going to say here closing P tag file save go to browser refresh you can see here at the bottom we have address colon and then I am going to add a text area to add a text area we are going to use a tag called as text area itself and text area tag is a paid tag so must and should write a closing text area tag file save go to browser refresh you should see text area added this is text area guys here user can be able to enter his address I can write here house number house number going to be something maybe Phi u bar 6-1 1-1 something then I can add city or near so so-and-so place . enter city right we can enter or user can enter multiple lines of text and we can take this input this is how you can create address bar text area we are going to understand few attributes of text area text area allows us to control the height of the text area by using the rows attribute we can mention how many rows by default the text area should show I say here 10 file save go to browser you should observe the height of the text area if i refresh it's not changing let me say here ok rose I have tried file/save go to browser refresh you can see that the height of the text area increase to 10 rows similarly I can mention how many columns it should show by default that is 30 columns I give calls control the width of the text area if I say refresh you can see that the width of the text area increased you have a facility to increase the decrease the width and height graphically also you can see that one more important attribute with respect to text area is wrap WRA P wrap that is a word wrap you can see if I go to format here we have word wrap this wrap and this word wrap both are same here we can say word wrap of file save what word wrap off will do means it will put entire text in a single line there will be no word wrap you can see if I am writing some text if any text not fit into the single line that text is going to be moved to the next line if a text is not fit in the single line or in the same line then the text is going to be wrapped to the next line understand this one if it is off right I have written here off file save go to browser and refresh you will see that entire text will get displayed into a single line there will be no word wrap guys there will be no word wrap if you want word wrap enabled okay then you can give here various things I give here VI R tual virtual I say file save go to browser and refresh virtual what it does means it enables the word wrap that means it makes the word wrap on you can see that anything that don't fit into 30 columns that is moved to the next line this text is not fit into these 30 columns automatically that text move to the next line these characters are not fit into the 30 columns they are moved down these characters didn't fit into this line they are moved down so virtual will enable the word wrap but one of the important thing is when we submit the form this entire text is going to be sent to the processing page as it is not wrapped as it is not wrapped okay understand if you want to send the information as it is in the text box as it is in the text area then you should give the value as physical be physical now what physical will do means physical will enable the word wrap there will be no problem user can see what is happening you can see it enabled the word wrap there is word wrap enabled graphically also when we submit this form the text in the text area will be sent as it is that means it is not sent into the single line if any breaks are there breaks are sent if any spaces are there spaces are sent so every word wrap points every information any formatting you have done that information also sent to the processing form hope you guys have understood how we can create text area in HTML and when we have to use text area for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
