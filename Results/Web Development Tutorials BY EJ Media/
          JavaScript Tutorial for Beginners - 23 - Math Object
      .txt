in this video we are going to continue along with global objects and again those are objects that JavaScript supplies for us and what does that mean we can use that global objects methods and properties so in this video we're going to look at the math object so I've created a variable here called number and it's going to store a value of 4.7 so let's create a new variable to work against this number so we'll call that number new number and we'll create a new value so we'll add 26 plus and here is where we can use the math object and actually we can just call the math object by name so we'll say math and the method that we're going to use is the round method and we're going to round our number variable which we declared up here so what the round method does is it will round it to the nearest integer since 4.7 is closest to 5 it will round it to 5 now if it was 4.4 it would round it down to 4 so it's not going in any particular direction I guess that's the point I want to make it will round it to the nearest closest integer which in this case again is 5 so we should get an output of 31 so let's go ahead and run this and you can see we got 31 now let's just set this to 4.3 or something and you will see now it will round it down to 4 and we should get an output of 30 so let's go ahead and run this again and you can see we got 30 now what if you wanted to go in one particular direction let's say we wanted to round this up to 5 well we can use another method and that is the ceiling method so we just put in CEI el and now this should round it up to 5 so let's go ahead and run this again and you can see we got 31 which is what we expected because it rounded it to 5 of course now let's set this back to 4.7 and let's say now we wanted to round this down to 4 we could use the floor method and that wall is round the number down so let's go ahead and run this and we should get an output of 30 and we did now I want to show you the square root method so let's go ahead and just get rid of this variable and let's change the value of our number variable so let's actually specify our math object again and we're going to call the square root method which is sq RT now let's pass in a value of 16 and so now as you probably know the square root of 16 is 4 and hopefully that's the output we get so let's go ahead and run this oops note we need to actually set this back to the old variable because we are not using the new number variable anymore and let's go ahead and run this and you can see we got the expected result of 4 ok so that's going to wrap it up for this video in the next video we'll look at another global object the date object
