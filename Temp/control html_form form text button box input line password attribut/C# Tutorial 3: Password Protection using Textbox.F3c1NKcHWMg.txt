hello guys welcome once again in the last video I have shown you how to make a simple login form with your c-sharp and MySQL database application and when I enter the password and user name it will check for the username and password and if the username and password is correct and it shows me the message that this is correct okay but remember last time I have told you that this password what I am writing here is visible so anybody could be able to recognize this password but I don't want that I want something like star to appear in place of my real password so my password is always hidden from others so how can I achieve this within the C shop application I will show you right now so let's go to the main form and just select your password text box here and then go to the properties and go to its name and copy this name ok so just copy this and then go to the code for this frame so just double click it and you go at the top and I will search for the function where my initial is component function is called so go in that public your frame name bracket and this brackets and wherever your initialized component function is there this is a default function with c-sharp creates automatically and this is the function which initializes all the components so just go there and just below that paste your password text name okay and then right dot password care so this one password care is equal to single quotes and in here in between the single quote you can provide your special character which whatever you want to show instead of your password so for example I want to show this dollar sign instead of my password so I will write this dollar symbol here okay and one more thing you can do is to restrict the number of character you can enter in the text box field so for example you don't want a long password to be entered with your application you just want to enter the password which is having the length maximum ten character can be entered so just once again write password underscore text this is your text box name dot max length is equal to 10 for example you can define it according to yourself according to your convenience so for example I'm defining 10 so my application or my password text field will not take more than 10 characters when I will enter the password so write these two lines wherever your initialize component is their function is there and when I run my code once again let's see I will write my user name and I will write my password so when I enter my password it will show this dollar symbol okay and I will enter try to enter more than 10 characters so count with me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 it will not go beyond 11 because it's restricted to 10 characters okay so in this way you can provide a password protection for your c-sharp login application and when I enter our correct login username and password and when I press login it will say user name and password is correct so in this way you can protect your password I think you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
