in the last few videos we took a look at media queries basically we added all these rules in our CSS stylesheet and that is useful of course if you want to handle certain different resolutions but you can also use entire new style sheets with media queries and so that's what we're going to do in this video so let's go ahead and do that now of course we know that we add style sheets in the head element we talked about that a long long time ago and that's where you do it basically you can add a media query for any different type of style sheet you can use now you might ask well why would I use a style sheet well if you had a lot of changes it's really not feasible to put a bunch of media queries in your existing style sheet so if you have a lot of changes that you're going to make it's probably better to use an entire new style sheet and again you can reference it with media queries so let's go ahead and we're just going to copy and paste this line right here and we're just going to paste it right below and now we're going to do is go ahead and tweak this code where we can add a media query so we type in right here media and then we just put in the resolution that we want and in this case let's go ahead and we'll play with that 400 pixel width again so we're going to go ahead and use the max width property it's very similar by the way as you can see so we're going to type in max width and again we're going to use a new style sheet when we hit 400 pixels so everything is pretty much the same it's very similar the only difference is you're using a separate style sheet and then we just close it out and of course what the href attribute is where we specify the style sheet of course we're not going to specify our existing style sheet we're going to specify a new style sheet and we're just going to call this style 2 dot CSS that's it so that's really all you have to do now we don't need any of these media queries since we're creating new style sheets we're going to go ahead and get rid of the media queries that we specified in our first style sheet so let's go ahead and get rid of those and we'll save this good so now what I want you to do is go ahead and close out of our first style sheet close that out and then what I want you to do now is go ahead and create a second style sheet called style tube dot CSS this name right here and then what I want you to do is go ahead and open that up and I put all this code in the description of this video there's a paste link for it so go ahead and get that and then place all that code in your style to dot CSS and you can take a look I've tweaked some things here basically I've made the container now for 100 pixels so it will exactly be the length of a device that is 400 pixels wide I've also tweaked the header you can see that's 396 pixels wide you will remember that we have to account for the border so I subtracted 4 pixels from the overall width and that gives us 396 pixels and then I set the sidebar and NAB to none so we don't even want to display that on this small device we want to get rid of those so I set those to display:none and of course we did that in the last video and we're going to do it again I think we just did it for the sidebar as I recall but we're going to do it for the nav too so we basically set those to none and then I tweaked the main element as well and I made that 396 pixels wide as well so this is an entirely new stylesheet so let's go ahead and save our site 1 dot HTML I can't remember if we did or not and then let's go ahead and open up our web page and see if it works ok so there it is and of course now we're using the first CSS stylesheet right the style dot CSS let's go ahead and minimize this now and see if this works and it did both our site and nav elements are gone and this is only now 400 pixels wide it perfectly fits so pretty cool now I want to show you one aspect of this when you're using multiple style sheets and in particular when one style sheet is for the main page and another style sheet you're using media queries I want to show you something really quick so let's go ahead and minimize this and then what I'm going to do is go ahead and get rid of this nav here we're just going to go ahead and eliminate that and I'm going to go ahead and save this and then let's go ahead and refresh our page and I want you to see what happens here and we're going to minimize this and there's the nav bar now you're wondering well wait a minute we have a separate style sheet here why did the nav bar display because there isn't even an entry here in our CSS style sheet well the reason is it got picked up in the first style sheet the style dot CSS so just keep that in mind that this style sheet still gets ready and we'll still load definitions if there's nothing specified in our style to remember media queries is more like an override it just overrides the existing stylesheet but if you don't put a display:none here for a particular element the first stylesheet will come into play that's the way it works provided there's an entry over here in the style dot CSS which of course there is for this navbar so just keep that in mind about how these overrides work so let's go ahead and we'll set this back and we'll save this let's refresh our page and it should be gone and it is okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video thank you
