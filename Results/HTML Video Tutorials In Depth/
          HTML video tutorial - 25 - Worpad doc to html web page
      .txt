hello friends welcome to HTML tutorials series in this tutorial we are going to work out an exercise right click open with the word pad here I have a word pad somebody asked me to convert this word pad to webpage what is a process I am going to follow and how we are going to create the same in web page let's see that first thing I am going to create an HTML page right so I go here say run I type notepad here we have a notepad let's create an HTML page HTML opening race closing HTML we know that hTML is divided into two sections head section similarly a body section opening body tag and a closing the ody body tag we know that in the head section we are going to write the title tag closing TI tle title i'm going to save this file save as we are going to save it at desktop so i say here des katie whoopee desktop and desktop i'm going to save this file with the name as exercise e ex e r SI c e exercise 1 dot HTML double quotation double quotation i use both the sides to save it as a web page so here i have exercise 1 HTML page i double click and open it in Firefox you can see that it has got open first thing if you see here introduction to signs is the heading for this whole web page I am going to use this name introduction to science for the title of the page you can see here the title of the page is the path of the web page so I am going to change that by putting here introduction to science title introduction to science file save go to browser refresh you can see that the title got changed to introduction to science good next thing is to create the web page itself to create this webpage I am going to copy this complete content from here put it in body section we know that whatever we put in the body section that is going to be displayed in the web page now we have this content you can see that introduction to science induction to physics we have pasted the content let me go to file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks and our output should be something like this to create output something like this what we are going to do we are going to use our HTML knowledge whatever we have learnt till now if you observe this introduction to science it is off kind of a heading right so what I need to do I am going to use the h1 tag just before they I Here I am going to say h1 tag and Here I am going to say closing h1 tag now we know that h1 tag is a block level tag so it takes the entire browser width and it moves the content anything which is in front of it to the next line so file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has moved all the content to the down and introduction to science is in the separate line if you observe here in this document introduction to science is in the center of the document so I need to align this text to the centre of the webpage what I have to do here I am going to use the align attribute so h1 after 1 before the greater than sign I am going to use the align attribute and I assign the value Center to it file save go to browser refresh check that introduction to science is now displayed in the centre of the webpage good next what we need next we have here 3 different headings in the document introduction to physics is 1 heading for this paragraph this is another heading this is another heading so for this I am going to use maybe h3 tag suits h3 h3 h3 so what I do here just before this introduction to physics he I I'm going to write h3 tag opening h3 tag then Here I am going to write a closing h3 tag we know that h3 tag is a block-level tag it moves all the content after the introduction physics to the next line and it takes the entire width of the browser window file save go to browser refresh check that out introduction to physics is on its own line next thing what I need I have a paragraph here this is a paragraph so I need to use a paragraph tag just before the P I am going to use the paragraph tag P tag that is a opening P tag and after this physics system I am going to use a closing P tag we know that the paragraph tag is also a block level tag so whatever there after this paragraph the all content is moved to the next line and a small space is added below the paragraph and above the paragraph we know that so file save go to browser refresh check that out now this is an independent paragraph now what I have to do I have to apply the h3 tag to introduction to chemistry right because it should be at the same level of introduction to physics so here what I do I add h3 tag opening h3 tag after the chemistry : I am going to close h3 tag we know that h3 tag is a block level tag whatever the content we have after the introduction to chemistry : is going to be moved to the next line file save go to browser refresh you can see that I got the introduction to chemistry on the next line right on its own line similarly this chemistry information is a paragraph so I am going to use a P tag over here and after this oxygen I am going to say closing P tag we know that the P tag is a block level tag whatever the content we have after the oxygen full-stop is going to be moved to the next line file save go to bra refresh you can see that the content moved to the next line and we have one space also between the paragraphs right now to this introduction to biology I am going to give h3 tag and after this I am going to use a closing h3 tag file save go to browser refresh I got this similarly before this biology I am going to say opening your P tag and at the end I'm going to say closing P tag file save go to browser refresh if you observe here we got the introduction to physics introduction to chemistry everything we got properly if you observe carefully all these paragraphs are justified can you see these things on both the sides left hand side and right hand side are aligned properly so I have to use a line attribute with respect to paragraph elig and align equal to j ust ify justify file save observe here you won't find this zigzag n'est refresh right both the sides are aligned properly good same thing I have to do for this paragraph and this paragraph so I copy this align justify to this paragraph similarly I pasted here also file save go to browser refresh so now we have got properly the paragraphs aligned right next thing is to align the first paragraph or format the first paragraph properly to format the first paragraph I am going to observe what are the modifications are there physics is displayed in bold you can see that it is displayed in bold so what I have to do I am going to use just before this P tag I'm going to use a B tag opening B tag and here I am going to use closing B tag file save this physics content is displayed in bold refresh you can see that the physics got displayed in bold similarly chemistry is in bold Oh G is in bold so I have to apply the same rule here for this chemistry I am going to write opening B tag after the chemistry I am going to write a closing V tag similarly just before the B I am going to write here opening B tag after the Y here I'm gonna write a closing B tag file save go to browser refresh check that out physics chemistry biology text are now in bold next we observe step by step if you see here study of matter and its motions through space and time is actually in italic format here study of composition structure up to the matter is in italic format life study of life to taxonomy is in italic format so I have to apply the italic right so just before this s I am going to use opening I tag up to this time I need closing I tag so from here to here the content is displayed in italic file save go to browser refresh check that out study of matter and its motions through space and time is now in italic similarly next is study of composition structure and properties of matter are in italic so same thing I do here just before this s I am going to write opening I tag up to this matter after the matter . i am going to close the i tag file save go to browser refresh is in italic format similarly here i have to change from here to here to italic so here just before this s i am going right opening i tag after this taxonomy . before the closing p tag i am going to write a closing i tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that this content is displayed in italic format next we proceed further and see any modifications here you can see matter motion space-time are actually italic as well as underlined if you see here already we have made this content italic all I need is I need to change these things to underline so just before this ma TT er I am going to write here you tag after the are I am going to write closing you tag save go to browser refresh you can see that the matter got displayed underline similarly for motion just before M I am going to use opening you tag after this n I am going to write closing you tag file save go to browser refresh motion got underlined similarly space and time we have here where is the space here is the space just before the s I am go right opening you tag after the e I am gonna write closing you tag similarly just before the T I am voted opening you tag after the e I am going to write a closing you tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that the space time all these things are underlined as well as italicum similarly here composition structure properties matter should be in underline you can see that composition structure properties matter what I do here I go to chemistry section here we have composition there just before C I'm going to use the you tag after the yin I am going to write a closing you tag just before the S I'm gonna write opening you tag after the e I am going to write a closing you tag before the P I am wanted opening you tag after the yes I am gonna write a closing you tag and before the matter I am wanted opening you tag after the matter I am going to close the you tag file save go to browser refresh check that they are underlined similarly here we have life living organisms structure evolution identification taxonomy should be underlined what I have to do now I have to go to the biology section there just before they yell I am going to read opening you tag after the e I am going to write a closing you tagged just before this living organisms I am going to write opening you tab after the yes I am gonna write a closing you tag then here before the S I am wanted opening you tag after the e I am gonna write a closing you tag before the e I am going to write opening you tag after the Yin I am going to write a closing you tag before the I I am going to write here opening you tag after the Yin I am gonna write a closing you tag before the T I am gonna write opening you tag after the Y I am going to at a closing you tag file save go to browser refresh check that everything we have arranged properly let's proceed further here we have e is equal to MC square e is equal to MC square h2o written in the red color so to do that i have to use the font tag right let's proceed further here we have e is equal to MC square there i am going to use opening font tag just before the e after the two I am going to write a closing font tag then I give a color attribute color equals to read five save go to browser refresh you can see that E is equal to MC square displayed in the red color same way here just before the e I am going to write this font color red after the two I am going to close the font tag so copy that and paste here file save go to browser refresh this is also displayed in a red color now I have to display h2o in red color so just before the edge I am going to paste font color red I copy that paste it here after the oh I have to close the font tag so I copy that and paste here file save go to browser refresh you can see that H 2 O God displayed in red color next what we have in this one if we observe carefully this too is superscripted this too is superscripted if you observe here our two is on the same pace so i have to shift the base up to move the two up i have to use a superscript tag what I do here I have a two so I have to move it up just before the two I am going to write opening su P superscript after the two I am going to close su p before the font closing font tag I close the super tag file save and refresh you can see that two is superscripted same thing I have to do for this two also here before the two I use su p opening super script tag after the two I am going to close the super script tag file save go to browser refresh right also you can see to base is shifted down so I have to subscript to subscript I have to go here I have to subscribe this two so before the two I am going to write su be subscript after the two before the oh I am going to close the subtag file save go to browser refresh you can see that H 2 over displayed properly anything else we have I think we have properly made it right you can see that left hand side and right hand side are same every formatting we have applied every alignment we have applied I think everything is correct only one thing I need to observe here is the font the font is of type Arial and here the font by default is a Times New Roman right so I need to change the font to Arial to do that I have to apply the font tag for complete content so just before or just after the body tag I am going to write font then I say here face is going to be a are i al arial right i have opening font tag with to the attribute and I have to close everything up to here just before the closing body tag I am going to write closing font tag file save go to browser refresh check that out the text is displayed in Arial this is how you can convert a normal word document to a web page understanding friends similarly you can see that the content that we have here they are all more darker we can reduce the color if we want we can reduce the color for these also font size also we can reduce right so the paragraph that we have here let's go to paragraphs that we have here we have the paragraph for physics just before this I am going to write font s I said e sighs maybe I give three and I also give the color s for el color to hash 80 80 80 I'm going to close the font tag just before the closing P tag okay and where is that we have that over here and here I am going to close the font tag closing font tag same thing I have to apply for all file save go to browser and refresh check that out the font is little bit different now right and here I made a mistake here I need double quotation file save go to browser refresh now you can see that the content is different in a gray color little bit light gray color we are right same thing I can apply for these two also I can copy this font from here copy that and paste it for the chemistry here after the paragraph opening paragraph tag and before the closing paragraph tag I have to close the font Fon Typhon same thing I have to do for biology after this paragraph here I am going to paste the font size is 3 and color we have applied and just before the closing paragraph I am going to write closing font file save go to browser refresh check this out this looks more better than the previous text right so this is how you can convert a normal word document to a webpage and modify according to your requirement give a best style so that the user can be able to read you our content for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML thank you guys thank you very much
