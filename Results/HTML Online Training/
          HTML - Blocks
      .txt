now in this particular HTML video we will discuss about creating the blocks using div tag div tag or division tag is basically a very common tag which you may find in any other HTML document and it is used to basically grouping for the grouping of different HTML elements for example if in a single web page you have be heading paragraph or image for the different groups and you want to put a similar formatting for each group then you can use the blocks that is div tag in order to put a common formatting for a particular section of your web page so let's see a practical implementation like how to start working with the blocks and div tags now in order to make the blocks what I have done for until now is I have put a couple of headings the paragraphs related to each heading and few points for each heading alright so basically as for my design of this particular page this is the first block for me and this one is the second block for me this is how this output is looking like but if I want to put some formatting as a group means whatever I want to put I want to put it for all the things which is residing in this first block similarly I want to do the same things for the second block so to enclose them in a single block what I can do I can add one div tag alright which will take care of a particular division of your web page and now here I'll just close this so this one is the first division and right after this HR I will add another div which I will close just before the body right here alright so now this is how I made these two segments now if I do any changes inside this div it will be reflected in each and every element inside it so let's say I want to change the font color of the first section so what I'll do I'll put a style attribute all right so basically we are not covering the style things here but just for this reference I am doing it here though we will create another tutorial for the CSS where we will learn about these style things in a great detail so what I'll do I'll change the font color so for that color and : I'll say green so let's come here and refresh it you can see the first segment is completely changed to green color similarly if I will come to div second div and here again I'll do the same thing like style is equal to color blue so this second one will be changed to blue font alright so this is how you can start making the segments or different blocks in a single web page where the help of this div and can do all the grouping things means grouping for group formatting or whatever change you want to do at once so this is about the div tag in HTML
