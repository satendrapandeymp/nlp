how's it going gasps today I'm going to talk about something called depreciated functionalities inside programming and in case you don't know what depreciated means it means that we have something that we've been using for quite a while inside programming that over time gets replaced by something newer and this happens all the time when it comes to programming especially at the moment with HTML and CSS so what I want to talk about today specifically is the last two episodes in this course here because in the last couple of episodes we learn how to create a front page in a couple of sub pages using HTML and CSS but we did it using techniques that at right now as its 2018 is being replaced by other techniques so we did actually when we did the previous episodes use something called float in order to take elements and put them next to each other inside the website and when we did this we did also get a couple errors where the container that already floated elements were inside of didn't grow in height together with the elements and we had to use a sort of hack called hidden overflow in order to make the container register that the head floated elements inside of it so this is something we've been doing for many years and for the past couple of years we've had a couple of new methods introduced to us that we could use in order to create layouts in a slightly different way which fixes a lot of the mistakes or not mistakes but complications that we had when it came to programming so what I want to do with this episode is I'm going to go ahead and point out a couple of methods or functionalities that are kind of new to programming that we haven't talked about yet but in the next couple of episodes I'm going to create a couple lessons on them and then we're gonna start using them from now on inside this channel here now the first method I want to talk about is something called CSS grid which is a new way we can create layouts using CSS that also makes it possible for us to change the layout where they are positioned inside the website when we scale it down to different devices such as cell phones tablets or other means now the point that I'm trying to get across here is that we constantly get new updates to all programming languages such as HTML CSS PHP javascript c-sharp you know all the different languages that we have out there gets updated constantly it's not something that happens every 10 years or so it happens all the time inside the different languages so the way that I usually do to try and keep updated on the different changes is that I like to go to Google and let's take HTML for example type in HTML trends 2017 or 2018 and then I would get some kind of top 10 list or something of different functionalities that are getting introduced or have already been introduced when it comes to HTML and this is just something that's part of being a developer when it comes to website because changes are good in most cases so we need to keep updated about this all the time now one thing about updates such as CSS grid or something called flexbox which we can also use in order to create different layouts inside CSS is we also need to make sure that all browsers can actually support these different functionalities that are new since some browsers have a bit of a delay when it comes to incorporating these into the browsers so we always need to check if different browsers does actually support new techniques now this takes the assess grid for an example I have a web site in front of me here that I can go into called can I use come and I went ahead and type in CSS grid at the top here and then I can actually see if CSS grid is supported by different browsers so as you can see we have different versions of Chrome we have two older one at the top and as we move down we have a newer version so right now C is the script which is something that's really awesome to use inside CSS it's actually supported by most browsers by now there's a couple of few for for example mobile phones that aren't supported and we do also have a couple of issues when it comes to Internet Explorer which hasn't fully incorporated yet now to give another example which is something that we're actually going to talk about in the next episode I believe which is something called flexbox which is a way for us to position elements in all sorts of ways whether being horizontally or vertically inside the browser and it's just much better than using float which we used in the previous couple episodes or the last couple of exercises so we're going to talk about flexbox in the next episode and then we're going to start using flexbox from now on in all projects we use in the future okay and as you can see that flexbox is actually green all over the place there's a couple of browsers that haven't fully incorporated yet but it's very close to being something that it's just you know that works everywhere so as you can see as I'm uploading this video we can pretty much use flexbox for every design that we have inside web development again the reason didn't use flexbox in the last couple episodes is because flexbox is sort of a new thing that require an entire lesson in order to learn it at least that's what I think and because I wanted to do a project before we got too complicated into CSS and HTML and that sort of thing I wanted to do a project with you guys before we got into flexbox so we had the last couple of exercises and after I've uploaded the next episode which is going to be about flexbox I'm also gonna go ahead and do a project creating something like a gallery perhaps inside the website that we created in the previous episode so we're going to create the layout for that specific page which is going to be the gallery page using flexbox so hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time hey guys hope you enjoyed this video I just want to say thank you for the support you've given me on YouTube and gave out a huge thanks to the people on patreon who supported me on patreon on a monthly basis and if you're new and you don't know about patreon you can go ahead and click on the link in the description of this video and it'll take you to my page on where you can pay a small amount every month either to support me or to download the lesson material for my lessons here on the channel so hope you guys will take the time to go and check that out and I hope to see you guys next time
