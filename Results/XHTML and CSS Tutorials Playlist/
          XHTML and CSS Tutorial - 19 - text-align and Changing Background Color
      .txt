alright guys your 19th XHTML and CSS tutorial and this is going to be a sweet one so what I want to teach you guys first is how to properly align text like Center justified and you can also make it left justified which it is by default or make it right justified so the first thing that we need is something that we can Center on our page so just go ahead and make something like a header three header one is just too big I don't like them so make a website let's do what I would have liked if I made it blog so buckey's blog and that looks pretty good so that's what we want the title it'll be what if we go ahead and save it right now look at this it's on the left hand side of our website and that just looks dumb title should never be on the left hand side what is this like you know I don't know I can't think of it I can't think of a good example but I want this title in the middle is what I'm trying to say so in order to do that go ahead and write header 3 of course and inside your curly brackets the property then we need to change is called text - or - I wonder what stuff oh I wonder what the correct term for that minus sign is if you know leave me a comment so I won't mess up in the future tutorials anyways text - a line and you can either have them there's one of four things you can do left which is by default which you just saw Center which we're going to make this right and I think there's one called justified now justified and I never use this one people usually don't but I think it's like what newspapers use where it's left and right justified so anyways I'll play around with that if you want but I want my text centered so let's go ahead and save this and see what we get refresh and check it out our title is now centered perfectly on our webpage pretty sweet huh so now that we have a blog let's go ahead and blog about something so I'm going to go ahead and make paragraph and I'm just going to write this is the best day ever and just go ahead and paste this bunch because I really want to stress get my point across that this is indeed the best day ever so I'm going to write it like 8000 times so let's go ahead and save this and refresh and it says all right this is looking pretty good but we can't really uh you know this first line doesn't really stand now it would be sweet if we could just indent this right here so you get this brilliant idea to go in here and right space space space space space space space about 15 spaces that looks pretty good so let's go ahead and save this refresh and what the heck what's going on it's not working did we break it no remember that XHTML is whitespace insensitive so it takes that whitespace and pretty much is like yeah I'm just going to ignore that so anytime we want to add an indent on our paragraph what you know you want to do a lot of the time actually you need to add a special property called text indent now text - or - who knows indent is spelled like that and you can either do this as a percentage I believe or what everyone just normally does is they use a certain number number of pixels how many pixels do you want to indent it in order to do that just write the number of pixels and write P X after it so now once we go ahead and save it it's going to go ahead and indent that 25 pixels or again you know you don't have to indent it 25 you can end out whatever number you like but that is how you indent text in a paragraph so anyways if you're trying to indent it like this before and it wasn't working that's why because XHTML is just going to ignore your whitespace and do it at once so that's how you make paragraphs indented so now that we have time let's go over something cool that you guys are probably wondering what do and I probably should have cover this and like one of the first CSS toriel's but hey we'll cover it now in order to change the overall font or excuse me the overall color of the text as well is the background of the entire webpage you need to edit the body element right here so let's go ahead and type body right there because we're pretty much this means effect the whole website so what do we want to do you to affect the whole website well the first thing that we want to do is let's go ahead and change the background color and you know what the property for this is well if you guess background - color you are correct so make sure I spell that right background color yup and let's go ahead and change it to something like blue that should look pretty good and after this so now check it out our website is going to appear blue with black text but I mean that's not the easiest stuff to read so if we have a dark blue background would be a lot easier to read if all this text was white kind of just like that so let's go ahead and do that and in order to make our text white we can do this in one or two different ways we can go ahead and add make our headers white and make our paragraphs white and make everything else white or what we can do is we can just go ahead and add a color white property like this color white property to the body and since everything else is in the body it's going to get affected as well so it's a lot easier than going through each one of your elements and changing it to white just change your overall body to white and that's going to affect anything that's in it so let's go ahead and save that and see what we get nice that is a lot easier to read and this website is looking pretty good mostly because it says book e on there and I'm just awesome guy so anyways that is a how you affect body background color in the text color and also center-aligned headers or pretty much center-aligned anything and also indent paragraphs so I hope you guys enjoyed I'm guessing you did so I think you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys next video
