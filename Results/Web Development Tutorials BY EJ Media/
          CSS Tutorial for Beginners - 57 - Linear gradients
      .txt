in this video we're going to cover CSS gradients now up to now we've sort of been using solid colors in CSS but you can also create gradient backgrounds and that involves using multiple colors at a minimum you would use two colors and that sort of gives you the gradient but you can also add more colors and usually the effect you get is one color will fade into another color and so it's kind of a cool effect that you can create using CSS now the most widely used gradient is called the linear gradient and so that's what we're going to cover in this video so you can see here I've just created this very simple div and I've got some simple CSS code that we're going to start out with and our webpage of course is blank because we haven't created the gradient yeah now we really don't need to use this HTML document this is going to stay as is we're only going to be working out of CSS so we can go ahead and just close this and yeah we better save it and let's just sort of resize everything here we're going to need a little bit more space for these gradients so we'll just kind of resize these images and there we go this looks much better okay and so the property we're going to be using to create the gradients is the background property now you can also use the background - image property what we're not going to use that in this video we may talk about that later on at some point but we're just going to use the background property now the first thing we want to do is set the color to blue you can put any color you want in here of course but we're just going to set the background initially to blue now the reason we want to do this is that if the browser that the user is using does not support gradients you want to have a fallback and in this case it would fall back to blue but you can put whatever you want here now the chances these days that the users browser wouldn't support gradients is pretty slim because most of the browser's today especially Google Chrome and Firefox automatically download updates and so chances are they probably have the latest and greatest version of whatever browser they are using but this is a good fallback so let's save this and we'll go ahead and refresh our page and we get a nice blue color here but that's obviously not going to be our gradient now what we're going to do is go ahead and recess if I the background property and then we're going to go ahead and create our gradient now there is a CSS function that we use inside of our background property and it is called the linear gradient that's what it and if you know anything about functions they come with parentheses and really all you need to know here is here's where we put in our values this is where we're going to create our gradient and we're going to use two colors so the first one we're going to specify is blue and then we're going to specify yellow and so this gives us a nice little gradient which we'll see in a second and if we hit refresh there you can see we've got our gradient now the default movement of the linear gradient is in a top-down order so the top of course is blue and here's the bottom and it moves in a top-down manner as you can see and you'll see here here's this sort of blend I was talking about so they sort of bleed into each other and that's that gradient effect that we're looking for now what if you didn't want this to go and top-down what if you wanted to move this in a different direction well we can add another value here right at the beginning we can go to right and we just put a comma there and now the colors will move from left to right so let's go ahead and save this and if you hit refresh see how that works now you sort of have this sideways movement by the way if you wanted to start this from the left you would just put two left here so that's how that works but it doesn't stop there you can actually move this in angles if you want pretty cool stuff and all we have to do here is say - top right let's save this again let's hit refresh and now you can see this is moving in an angle knowledge moving to two top right now if you wanted to move this to the bottom you would just say - bottom right I think you get the idea or - bottom left and so it's kind of neat as you can move it in angles ah but you can actually move it in custom angles yes and this is where we actually can specify a degrees so we could say we want to move this 30 degree so we put in 30 and then you just put in the keyword deg right after that and it'll move it 30 degrees now so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh it and you can see we're now moving this 30 degrees if you wanted to put this at 45 degrees you could do that as well and you can see now it's moving 45 degrees so this gives you a little bit more control of the angle that you want to move the colors in now as I said you can add as many colors as you want so let's add green into the mix here so now we're going to do three colors it's good and save this refresh and now you can see we've got three different colors here green blue and yellow now let's actually switch back to blue and yellow and we'll just quickly refresh our page here get this back to where we were now what if you wanted a particular color to dominate over the other color well there's a way to do that and what you can do is put in percentages in here so we can put after this yellow 20% and I'll show you how this works in a second so let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh and there you can see yellow dominates now you're probably saying wait a minute weren't you saying here yellow should only take up 20% that's actually not what this means what it means is and let me think how to explain this okay so remember this goes in a top down order so what we're saying here is at 20% down start yellow basically that's where we want you to start painting the background yellow so that's what happens we get about 20% down here and boom everything else from that point on is going to be yellow so that's how this percentage works it is a little bit confusing but it's basically simple once you understand it now what if you didn't want this bleed effect here what if you just wanted this to be a straight line across you didn't want any bleeding effect here well you can actually do this by having both of these equal out to 100% so we can say we want yellow 50% and then we can say we want blue 50% and basically what this will do is give you a straight line across and I'll show you that refresh the page and there you go we lose that sort of gradient effect so again if you don't want that bleed effect you have to give percentages to all the colors and then you'll just get sort of this straight line okay that is going to do it for linear gradients see you guys in the next video
