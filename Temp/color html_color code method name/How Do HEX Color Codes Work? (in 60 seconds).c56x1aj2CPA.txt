how does this mean this to a computer the video you're watching now is made up of tiny pixels on your screen each pixel has a red green and blue light which add together to produce what your eyes see as a single color hex tells the computer how much of each light to use it's a six digit code with three parts one for red green and blue the letters A through F are used to represent the numbers 10 through 15 so that more than 99 values can be held in two digits now in action e8 is the red value each digit must be multiplied with 16 to the power of its place since hex is a base 16 system so first we have 8 times 16 to the 0th power next is e so 14 times 16 to the first power added together the computer knows to set the red light to 232 this process is continued until the computer knows how much of red green and blue to show for each of the millions of pixels every fraction of a second
