gentlemen ladies so welcome to your 20th html5 tutorial and in this lesson actually in the next couple lessons I'm going to be talking a little bit more about css3 now I know we talked a little bit about it before but there's actually a ton of crap we need to cover concerning css3 and actually html5 and css3 are like married together kind of like XHTML and CSS where so this tutorial series could have even be called html5 and css3 because that's how connected they are you can't really use one without the other and if you do it's not going to work out too well so enough of me talking let me go ahead and explain I first ripped everything out of our body because excuse me my website because we only really need something simple for this demonstration so make sure you have a div which is going to you know just around your entire website and just like a paragraph or any text inside if you have text surrounded with a span but just go ahead and copy this throw in your website and won't be good I didn't want to go ahead and retype this because all you guys know what this stuff is already I also have a you know my body centered and I gave that div background and a border so I also change the text but none of this really matters as long as you have this set up you can make it look like anything you want so basically I am working with this website right like this nothing new so anyways let's get to the meat of the tutorial now that you know how my template is set up so the very first thing I want to talk to you guys is about giving rounded corners to your div or to any box really now as you can see these boxes have nice square corners in with a lot of websites nowadays that's what they want but for some reason people tend to prefer round corners so let me go ahead and show you guys you see this window right here you look at that my arrow changes that's pretty cool I don't know I'm just fascinated by that look an arrow but anyways you see how these corners are rounded wouldn't it be nice if we can achieve the same effect of this on our website well ladies and gentlemen the time has come where you can actually do that so before the old CSS excuse me yeah the old CSS it was very difficult to achieve this but for now using css3 it's actually incredibly simple almost too easy if you ask me so what you need to do is throw your web kit in there and the property is border - radius now what you need to do is you need to give it a value say uh 25 the higher the value the more rounded they're going to be so if you round these 25 pixels and save this take a look whenever I refresh in my corners I now have nice sweet rounded corners so basically as soon as this becomes a standard I got a feeling you guys are going to be seeing a ton more rounded websites because I don't know it just looks like more futuristic rather than this old square crap they're saying okay that's pretty nice okay css3 can round my corners not that impressed well wouldn't it be nice if this box right here if we could make it look just a tidbit prettier so how can we do that let's go ahead and apply a shadow and I know what you guys are saying OMG I was in college like three years ago and they told me to apply shadows and that was the biggest pain in the butt it was this whole process yeah a data well with css3 it is a thousand times more simple than it was in the past couple years so the property for this is WebKit and it's box shadow now the properties or excuse me the values kind of get kind of weird here so you need to listen closely the very first thing it's going to take is a color RGB and this is the red green and blue value now just say it's anywhere from zero to 255 and I'm going to put mine in like 110 110 110 the higher you go the more white it's going to be the lower you go the darker is going to be if they're all the same it's a shade of gray so that's somewhere it's kind of like a dark gray and it takes at least two values after this now the first value it takes is the offset - left and right so I'm going to go ahead and put eight pixels and that's going to shift the shadow eight pixels to the right because if we put it directly under our box is going to be covering up so we have it shipped directly to the right eight pixels and directly down eight pixels so let me go ahead and show you guys that not 8/8 don't wanted to do that and save this baby and we'll see what we got and it didn't save because RGB ten ten ten okay box shadow Oh what the hell whoops get what the heck is a web skip that's embarrassing now if we save it refreshes beast and you see we got a nice dark gray shadow to the right in down eight pixels looks awesome doesn't it uh not exactly because when the heck have you ever seen a shadow that looks like that in a coloring book maybe shadows have some kind of blur to them they have like a gradient that kind of fades out so in order to add this blur we need one additional value so this is the offset to the right this is the offset to the left and by the way if you have a negative number like this then it's going to shift it to the left instead of the right it's just right and down is the standard by anyways if we have one more value let's say eight pixels this third pixel value is the amount of blur in other words the amount of gradient that it's going to fade out so now if we go ahead and save this inner fresh take a look at my gradient right here and actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to blast all these up so it's really easy to see on YouTube ten ten ten save this biatch and refresh and check it out we now have a nice gradient blur fading out of our shadow so how awesome is that it's now looking like a realistic shadow and oh man I probably don't got time to talk to you guys about tech shadows and gradients but what I do have time to talk to you guys about is this last property that you can add to a shadow so I'll just I'll just do that so as you can see the shadow kind of looks like this box is casting a shadow on the background of our website however there is a way that we can make the shadow on the inside of our box now we can add an additional property to this in your saying okay we have three colors and three pixels in I want me to add more stuff yes you have an optional word you can add called inset not incest inset now whenever you add this word what it means is okay instead of the shadow being on the outside of the box it's going to look look like something is casting the shadow on the box so it gives you that effect of kind of you know a button Preston or something and all of the same other properties apply um you know your blur your color all that same stuff so this is how I don't know maybe you want to make a box and make it looks like it's a button press then I don't use it that often because I don't like the way it looks but if you want to use that it's called inset and you add it right to the end and I believe that's the only additional word that you can use so anyways in the next tutorial I got to talk to you guys about text shadows which are a little bit different and also how you can make gradients for example make this fade from blue to red and if you think you know how to do it from the old CSS we got a totally new better way of doing it so nice thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
