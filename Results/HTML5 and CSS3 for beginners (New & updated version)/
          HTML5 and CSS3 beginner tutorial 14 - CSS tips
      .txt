hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number fourteen and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about some helpful CSS tips and tricks that you're going to use pretty much every single day whenever you use CSS so right now if you take a look at my document I have got a paragraph over here that says style me I've ripped out all of the other code except for this link to my external style sheet so if you guys haven't watched the video the previous video on external style sheets go back and watch that and you can learn how to link to an external style sheet and then I have my external style sheet over here which is almost blank so right now I've got a paragraph that I've selected and then I've opened up my curly braces but I haven't applied any styling to this which means that if I open this up in my browser this is exactly what it looks like in fact let me just zoom in a little so you can see that this is an unsterile graph but because i'm going to be changing font sizes in this tutorial i actually want to be zoomed all the way out so you can see the difference between one font size and another because right now this is 14 pixels and we're going to increase this to something a little bit bigger right so one of the first CSS tips I want to show you guys is how to make a CSS comment so you open this up with a forward slash and eight asterisks and then you end it off with a forward slash and an Asterix and everything in between these two symbols will be commented out that means that I can type notes to myself or I can comment out some specific code or something like that without actually deleting it from the file and yeah it's it's basically the same thing we use an HTML comment for except this time it the syntax is just a little bit different we instead of using these funny symbols we are using an asterisks and a forward slash and then again an asterisks and a forward slash so that's just how to make a CSS comment let's go over to the next line and I want to show you guys some font property shortcuts right so in the previous video we learned how to change font family and I set that equal to Helvetica let's see if I can spell it right this time yeah ten points so finally on the third video again it's built right right so whenever I save this that's going to change the font family of my text to Helvetica you can see that this now looks very different to the previous font right let me just pull that back to 100% again because I also want to show you guys a few other font properties which if I type font you can see I've already got the shortcuts or not the shortcuts but the the other font property showing up over here so you've got things like font variant font style font weight and font size so let's work with font weight which font weight determines whether your text will be bold or not so you can either give this a value of normal if you want normal text or you can give it a value of bold if you want bold text and there are actually values in between so you can have 400 which is usually normal text but you could also have something like 700 which is like semi bold and then you've got values like 900 which is fully bold so this does depend on what font you're using not all fonts have different weights but a lot of them do so it really depends if you want to use a font just check if there are multiple font weights available and then you things like values like 400 or 600 or 900 but I'm just going to use bold and that would be fully bold then I'm going to choose font size and I'm going to set this equal to 28 pixels now you can actually use a bunch of different CSS measurements so CSS supports centimeters inches millimeters and all of those values centimeters millimeters all those those values are fixed values they are static values they will never change so if you ever wanted to create a document that was made for printing or made for for actually yeah being printed out then using centimeters or using inches or points makes sense because then you know exactly how big the stuff is when it's going to be printed out but most of the time we don't print websites out right and we're looking for websites that will scale relative to the size of the screen which is where we want to use values like pixels because one pixel can be bigger on my computer then it might be on somebody's phone so using pixels is at least better but the best value to actually use is something called an M now 28 M is going to be massive because M is the size of 1 M in the current font so if we take a look at this now this M right there that is the size of 1 M right so if I change this to something like 2 m our text should get twice the size it is now so let me go ahead and save this come back over to the browser and hit refresh and yeah you can see the text is much much bigger it's twice the size and it is now bolded so I have this naughty habit of using pixels instead of M s so you can see the textures changed slightly smaller but most people do encourage you to use M's these days instead of pixels especially when it comes to fonts so make your decision read up and decide whether you want to use M's or pixels and yeah the main thing I wanted to show you guys here is that we actually have shortcuts in CSS so I explained a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't actually need to because the one thing I did want to explain is that in CSS along with all the properties that we can change we have shortcuts so right now we've got a font family property we've got a font weight property and a font size property it's a little bit annoying if I'm going to type all of these out over and over and over again whenever I want to change something so there is a shorthand shortcut called font that is it right and whenever you specify font you can then change the values of a certain or a number of properties using just one shortcut right so if I set a size of let's say 36 pixels and I'm going to set a font family again of Helvetica now you can see I'm using the font property to change two values instead of one so let's come back here and hit refresh and now I have text that is 36 pixels in size and it is also Helvetica in family but I can also change the font weight so font weight needs to be at the beginning of the shortcut so let's save this come back here and hit refresh and now it has been bolded you'll notice if you play around with these values and like maybe put bold at the end certain properties will now be ignored so let's hit refresh and now you can see font family got ignored the font size is still right for some reason but the on two-way it's also got ignored so whenever using shortcuts like this you have to make sure or yeah you have to be aware of the order you're putting these things in every single shortcut has a specific order that it needs to be put in and you can find these orders whenever you google something like that so if you want a shortcut for colors or you want a shortcut for background colors or something just Google CSS background color shortcut or shorthand and that will give you the exact order for example font if I type italics in here as well or italic this is font style style goes first weight goes second size goes third and family goes forth so that is the specific order you have to put these things in if you do not put them in this order like I showed you the CSS will not work so let me come back here and hit refresh just prove to you this is now at italicize bolded this it's big in font it's 36 pixels and it is a font family of Helvetica so my shortcut worked and then it's pretty much the only shortcut I know of hand most other shortcuts that you have to Google if I want to use them and that is all I have for you in this video so I'll see you guys in the next one where we will be taking a look at how to use CSS colors I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means not to me now what you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me out on patreon you can also check me out on social media I will leave the links next to me so go ahead and click on something and I'll see you guys next time
