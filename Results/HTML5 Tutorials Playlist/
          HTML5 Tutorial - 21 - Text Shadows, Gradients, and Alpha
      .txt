alright guys welcome back to your 21st tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to be talking about a couple more things starting with a text shadow so as you can see we can apply a shadow to our div box however if we added the same property to the text it wouldn't work that's because this property is for boxes only sounds gross but I know so what we need to do in order to achieve a text shadow is actually do this we don't use the WebKit at all I don't know if this is a standard a I didn't think it was but whenever I was playing with this like I don't know I was making my website like three weeks ago I found out that you just use text shadow without the WebKit box and just put your RB G values or excuse me our G be Green Bay I always mess that up and I'm just going to use the same shadow color in fact I'm Way too lazy to type this so I'm just going to go ahead and paste that right there and actually for my spread and I probably don't want to use 10-10-10 because that's a lot for some text so just use something like three pixels three pixels and give it a blur of five now whenever we do this and save it in refresh we can see that we got a nice shadow on our text so if you ever want to apply a shadow to a text and you don't want to do it through Photoshop and images you want to mix text that you can highlight still because then you can copy and paste it in everything this is how you do it so it's a little bit different from the Box shadow in the sense that you got to make sure that your fade isn't so much and also you don't use the WebKit it can be confusing because using on one shadow but not the other but hey that's what it is don't believe me so now what I want to do is I want to talk to you guys about gradients so up until this point we use this I'm just going to change the gradient of this background right here we use the same plain-jane solid color orange red yellow however that's getting kind of boring so what didn't it be cool if we could change this color to make it fade into one another so what we want to do is we want to get rid of this background because orange see you later we're done with you what we want to do add however is a new background so background and there's a couple different ones that you can add and they all belong in the web it or they're all part of the WebKit however you say the first gradient I want to talk to you about is a linear gradient Lin ear gradient and it's kind of set up weird because let me see how to explain this it takes three values in the parameter the first value is your starting position where you're going to be doing is you're going to be giving it to colors say we're going to be giving a black and white well it's going to say okay do you want me to fade it this way or this way or at an angle where do you want me to start so we're just going to say okay the first color we want you to start at the top this the second value is the color and I'm just going to make this black and white really simple I'm not going to spice this up a bit so we're we're going to say is this we're going to give you black and white start with black and with white and start at the top simple enough so now if we refresh this we see that we get a nice black to white gradient starting at the top now the values for this are top bottom I don't even know if left and right but I do know that you can have like degrees and if you want to have it fade at angle you put something like four or five in de G stands for degrees so now we should get a nice 45 degree angle just like that so that is pretty much how you can use a linear gradient however they also have radial gradients are ad i al rad or Ray Dyle I don't know I just do that I just split my words I don't know just to amuse myself so anyways obviously we can't use these same parameters because what you need to fit in a circle doesn't use the same properties as a straight line so the very first thing you write is where you want to start and we want to start in the center the next property is what shape do you on it we want this gradient to look like a circle and everything okay isn't all radial circles well you can also have ellipse in here and that's that's kind of like a stretched out circle so you can also have that as well now the next thing you write is it's going to take two more things however they were like kind of in two parts and I know this is really weird this is going to look weird in a row do this but I'm just going to go ahead and type it and get it over with red 0% and I'll fade it to like orange and let me just put this like 50% of something that should be good so it takes 4 parameters but parameter 3 and parameter 4 are kind of two parters so I know this is a really weird thing but hey if you want to work with radial gradients this is the price you pay so oh hello let me go ahead and save that and refresh and see what we've got what we have is something starting in the center fades out in a perfect circle in turns from red to orange so you see that center circle red orange and these numbers right here are basically where you want to fade the faith to begin so it's zero percent we mean start fading as soon as you you know pretty much start making the color if we put like 20 percent or something then this middle 20 percent would be solid red so since we put 0 percent that's where we said where you want the faith to begin and of course 50 cent or 50 cent 50 percent is the orange so it starts fading at about 50% right like that so I know it's kind of a weird setup like I said but there you go that's what you need to do and the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is this I want to explain another version that we can write colors they used it they incorporate it not now it's called alpha and let me see what can we apply this to the text might be kind of hard to see with that shadow or excuse me that gradient right there so you know how this shadow is kind of opaque and it kind of fades off you're saying okay that shadow doesn't really look realistic it looks too dark if we could apply an alpha value to this that would be amazing now another word for alpha is transparency how transparent says it in other words how much can you see through it so you don't use the RGB values for this anymore what you do is you use a new value called RGB a now it's going to take your 3 RGB values red green and blue however it's going to take a fourth additional value and that's the of value now I'm just going to put 0.7 in there and the only thing that you remember is the less it is the lighter your shadows going to be so let me go ahead and save this and as you can see my shadow lightened up quite a bit because it was won by default and whenever we put it 2.7 we could see through it more it's more transparent and if we had something really light like 0.3 I don't know if you guys are even going to be able to see this but that would be really light where you can almost see completely through in 0 of course means that it isn't even there so I like mine around point 6 because then it gives you a nice realistic shadow look it isn't so dark where it looks like whoa what is this like shining a flashlight directly on it we want to give it a nice subtle popping out look and I think that yeah that's it for this tutorial this website is looking pretty good we have a nice Sun fire oh my god WTF BBQ and a nice subtle shadow I think this is a good to package up and sell the web development companies so anyways that's all I got for you guys for the story I know I'm throwing a lot of information at you and again I want to stress one more time I know these are really weird setups right now but it's not CSS 3s fault it's they didn't standardize everything yet so all these like web kits are going to go away soon so it's going to get easier I promise and in the next story we got some more stuff to cover with css3 and i'm going to begin to make some awesome looking websites so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
