hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series from the past few video tutorials we are trying to design this web page layout by using table tag as well as we are trying to design this web page layout by using div tag in the previous video tutorial we have designed the layout by using table tag you can see that in this video tutorial we are going to design the same web page layout by using div tag we are going to complete it you can see here we have created a wrapper div inside that we created a div which is going to behave as a header and it is working properly now we are going to proceed further and add remaining divs so here I am going to create one div closing div this div we are going to use for navigation purpose so this is going to be identified as now one more dip I am going to create this we are going to use for main content area so this is going to be identified by the identifier main similarly one more dip I am going to create this is going to be for sidebar so I am going to give ID name as aside and one more dip I am going to create this is going to be for footer purpose now we have all the divs laid out now we set the styles on them so let's set the style style first style I am going to set is the width of 300 pixels I said semicolon and I said the height also heig SD height of 300 pixels semicolon later we modify same thing I am going to do for all other dibs I am going to set the BG color also let me set the background color background - color of sine semicolon this thing I am going to copy from here paste for every if this is going to have the background color of light gray and aside is going to have background color of yellow and footer is going to have a background color of black BL ACK black file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have for dibs one below another one for nav one for main content one for a sidebar and one for footer now we proceed further and layout it properly I hope you guys have learned and understood float property CSS float property that I have explained in the previous video tutorials we use that float property to layout these divs properly first thing is of course we know that if we set float:left property we know that this nav is going to be taken out of the normal flow and floated towards left in its container itself and below lives are going to be moved up so what we are going to do here is I am going to set here FL o eighty float le ft left semicolon let me put content here nav this is going to be for main this is going to be sidebar sidebar and this is going to be footer file save as we are floating this div now to the left these divs are going to be moved upward right file save go to browser and refresh you can see that nav is floated to the left but these three divs are moved up here we have sidebar and footer behind the nav we have main content so let me float it to the left that also so main content div we have that one also I am going to float towards left semicolon file save go to browser if i refresh nav and maincontent are going to be placed one beside another the sidebar is going to be moved up as well as the footer is also going to be moved up if i refresh you can see that nav and main are one beside another sidebar div is moved behind the nav and footer is moved up and also you can see the height of our container is changing now I am going to set float left to the aside also FL o a tea float le ft left semicolon file save now what happens nav main and aside are going to be placed one beside another this footer is going to be moved inside if i refresh you can see that the footer styles are moved inside and the wrapper our wrapper div height is changed to smaller right you can see that it is reduced now what we can we need to do is we should not allow the effect of float on flu footer so the simple thing is I am going to set here clear le ft left semicolon when I say clear left we know that footer is not going to be get affected by the effect of float property you can see that footer is back in its place as we have set here footer of 50 pixels we are going to set the footer height 250 pixel file save go to browser and refresh and let's set the width of this footer to 100% so I am going to remove this 300 pixels and I set it to 100% file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the footer filled properly content is not getting visible we make it soon visible and also the height of each of these divs nav main and side bar should be 400 so I am going to change that to 400 so this one should be 400 this one should be 400 this should be 400 file/save go to browser and refresh and see that the height got increased and width also we need to change so the first nav width should be 200 pixels main content area width should be 500 pixels and a side which should be 200 pixels file save good browser and refresh now we have created the required layout and also I am going to set for this span style color of white and at the end I am going to close the span file save go to browser and refresh let me put this footer in the middle so here I am going to say what we have in the table in the table we have at copyright so I am going to write the same thing at COP why copy righ T copyright and the text align of this div te XT text a lig and align we set it to Center semicolon file save go to browser and and refresh you can see the text got aligned properly and we left with the border we need to remove to do that I am going to remove the border here I set it to 0 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see that border is removed now we have achieved the required a layout you can see that they both are same there is no difference only thing is this content area content area I have to add that is not a problem you can just put here main content area here you have to write nav content area and this is sidebar sidebar content area file save go to browser refresh this is how you are going to design any layout by using the div tag I hope you guys have understood how do we design a layout by using table tag and div tag and it is very easy only thing one of the most important property we need to understand is floating which is most important and it's quite simple you can see we created a wrapper inside that we created one do for header one do for navigation one do for main content one do for aside one do for footer and then we laid out properly so for this tutorial this much is enough friends I hope you guys have understood how do we design layouts by using table and div for more benefits
