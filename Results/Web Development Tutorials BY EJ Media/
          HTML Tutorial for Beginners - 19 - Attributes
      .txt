in this video we're going to take a break from coding and talk about HTML attributes and we've been looking at those in previous videos but I'm going to explain more about those in this video now before we do that let's do a little bit of a rehash on elements and tags now as we know elements are made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag and what do these elements do they tell the browser something about the information that is between these two tags the paragraph element will tell the browser that there's some text here the heading element will tell the browser that there's a heading here and the body will tell the browser that everything that's inside the body will make up the actual web page so at a basic level that's what elements do and now you might ask the question well what's the difference between tags and elements and the answer to that is not a lot they're almost one and the same in fact you'll hear a lot of people refer to this as an element you'll hear some people refer to it as a tag some people refer to it as element tags other people will call it tag elements so they are very very close and they essentially do the same thing now if you wanted to get really specific you would say that these angle brackets here are an element and until we put this P in here that tells it what type of element it is it's tagged as a paragraph element now what are attributes what we've been looking at those this right here is a class attribute and all an attribute really does is it gives more information about a particular element it allows you to do a little bit more and in this case this is a CSS class and we're turning this text blue and so it not only provides extra information it gives us some more functionality and the key here is this attribute is specific to this element this P element and only that so if we had another paragraph element down here it could have a different attribute or no attribute at all so just keep that in mind it's specific to the actual element that it's inside you'll also notice that always goes in the opening tag you never put it in the closing tag so attributes are always in the opening tag inside these angle brackets now attributes always have three items first we need to put the attribute name and these are standardized of course then we need to use the equal sign and then we assign it a value the equal sign of course assigns it a value so those are the three parts to almost every attribute now you'll remember in previous videos with the label element we use the for attribute and the reason I put this example here is that some attributes only go with a particular element so for instance the for attribute is only available for the label element you wouldn't put that in a paragraph element whereas the class attribute you can put in almost every type of element there is so just be aware that in some attributes you can put in almost every element and other attributes are very specific to a specific type of element now attributes are going to become more important when we get to the CSS tutorials and JavaScript tutorials ASB tutorials those kind of subjects but I just wanted you to understand how they work in HTML before we get to those series okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
