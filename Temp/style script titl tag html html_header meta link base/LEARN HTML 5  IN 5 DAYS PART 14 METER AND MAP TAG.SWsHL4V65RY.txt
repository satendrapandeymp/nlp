hi friends welcome to the channel of learning by doing today I'm going to talk about some more tags in the history milf I and now I'm opening my notepad plus plus here we have the basic tax on to me and today I'm going to talk about the one of the important act which was introduced in the html5 that means me to tag I mean Sheree me to tag okay guys today we are going to talk about the meter tag and in this meter tag what is the use of me to tag and why they define the meta tag is nothing but the meta tag defines a scalar measurement within it known range actually or a fractional value I mean it was just like a gauge I mean it finds a scale a measurement if you want to display this much of measurement for something this is all done by using the meter tag and we are going to write the code of the meter time here it can be put in the paragraph itself there is no issues of that and i put the ending of paragraph as /p as usual in between this i'm going to mark i'm just writing as mark is i mean just to define the what do you say the scale of measurement value in the Train design writing the meter tag meta tag is just right as meter and it's also going to be end with the slash meter / meter and in between this i'm going to write anything a blood pressure i don't know whatever you want to measure on in meters or anything I mean just as a scalar value we can right there I'm writing markers that or exam or something exams how many people were passed in the exam and all this if you want to look at all these measurements and in the form of a meter I mean like in the form of any graphical representation we can use this meter as an attribute and sorry as a tag and we have many attributes in the meta tag and what are those attributes if we want to measure the meter is high it doesn't defined anything I just define the meter starting tag and the meter ending that so this says that it does an empty meter tag and if I want to define this is the passport the percentage of my college if I want to define that then we need to write as some of the attributes introduce some of the attributes to define those values so I'm copying this and I'm going to paste it here and in the meter tank i'm going to write the attributes based were given by the programmers as low high maximum and all these on some of the attributes which are in the meter tag i'm going to define all those things here here i am going to write something else 69 as the low pass percentage and the high pass percentage in my college was eighty percent we can write it as an eighty percent and what is the maximum pass hyper high pass percentage for anyone is the hundred percent and what is the best value for this is because of an on an average of all these three what's the value that going to be displaying your meter tag was eighty-four percent is an average percentage of our college then we are going to display this in our in our in our page okay guys i'm going to save this and i'm going to run using the chrome what we are going to see let's wait okay see see here in the chrome we have see guys without any measurements in all these I got the ultimate I got the meter tagged with an empty empty without any range without any scale of measurement it but i have given the eighty-four percent as ortutay an average of my pass percentage in my college like that whatever you think for exams then it was shown with some of the content in it that's nothing that other meta tag what we are going to be displayed today I'm in disgust today and I'm going to teach you another type of fact today that is known as um mapped and which was also very new tags and math tag was introduced in the history of l5 itself what is the main purpose of the math tag is it's going to be give a relationship between map and the emmys that you are given I mean if you give it an image and you have you want to see where it was located in there all these things some of the things then it will directly linked up to the map oh what a clickable areas in it so I'm going to show you the map tag the math tag is also starts with the name of map and it's going to be end within and / map / map guys and in between this we are having up some of the other tags like we need to bring some I mean image here and we need to link up with the map here and we need to get some records and all these f with it I'm going to show some of the things I mean we didn't have the image tag here right okay i'm going to give one image tag image source we need to give that top source here and find this also we have we need to mention use map use map is one of the new attribute which was introduced in the image tag navigate i'm in in the html5 i'm going to give the image tag like indian flag we have already seen night whereas the Indian flag here okay i'm going to select the root of this oh god oh okay i'm going to copy this and I want to paste it here okay so that was a source right and between this i'm going to paste / indian flag dot PNG i have given this and i use my here we need to mention the use map this was going to be mentioned by followed by an hash symbol that was one of the constraint here in this and in this i'm going to write and some indian flag ancient flag topped not it okay i'll just give the there is no need of mentioning any PNG and all these extensions for this use map and all and in this and then we are in the map tag we are going to give for their for which we are going we want the map to reveal represented i'm going to give it as indian flag okay for this picture i am going to i want the map to be get represented for this on what records you want I'm invade that has to be all the I mean longitude latitude value should be there right and all this we need to mention here and for that all this purpose we have then another tag called the area tag in this arm and in this area tag we need to get we are having many more values that is a shape shape has to be look as rectangle or anything we have that option to be in this history ml Phi and d'accord I mean call it out I mean coordinations coordinations what what we want to be the coordination of this and we have that too and we can represent this in the way as Z you know 0 x and y value x axis y axis taxes and all these will be having some some of those right we can represent whatever we want they're all these representations i have given only the as a random some of the nimbus in this we are going to bring it to link up with the heads reference tag has been as an anchor tag with the hyperlink reference snack with and over the anode or HTML tag then it will move to another HTML tag where it was located i'm in like does we have any another HTML tag in all right now in our computer all such we have any something means in that may be linked up our image with the another HTML tag we're really i mean like a map tiger directly but i'm giving some mother HTML time does we have any other history multi-class when dot HTML right this is always going to be linked up with this oh well put that tongue property here I mean the link effects oh I'm copying this and I'm going to paste it here ok ok I'm going to paste it here and / class 1 dot HTML in this manner we need to link up our image with the another tank by using this map I mean like we have to connect with the map some other maps in the Google and all this but that doesn't have the internet connection now so I'm going to show with some of the examples in mind what do you say in my I mean we need to have some map tags were mapped out his team and something like then we can link up with the the map plans which are going to be represented so I'm going to save this and we see how it's going to look in our google chrome see it when you click on this see it was going to the other other history email page in the same manner if we click on the arrow of it I'm in on our image it will directly linked up to the map i'm in for the map also we need to create one hits tml like map when don't history mall or something like that and then it will directly linked up to do HTML what is I mean the globe in that manner this is one of the benefit of the map pack so thanks for watching my video if you liked my video subscribe to my channel
