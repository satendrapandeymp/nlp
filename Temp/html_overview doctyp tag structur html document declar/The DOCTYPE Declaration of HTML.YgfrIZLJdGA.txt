we talked about the basic structure of an HTML document where we have everything contained within these HTML tags and then we have a head section and a body section but we've left one very very important thing out and that's the document type declaration now the document type declaration lets our browsers know specifically what version of HTML is being used for example if we come to the w3 org website which we'll talk more about in a second and then go to the View menu here and click on page source you'll see at the very top underneath this XML declaration we have this doctype well this is the document type definition here this specifies about what specific type of HTML is being used here here we're using eight XHTML 1.0 strict and it's very important to let your browser know what type of HTML is being used otherwise it won't really know how to properly render the HTML that you've written now one thing we haven't really talked much about yet is X HTML XHTML stands for extensible hypertext markup language and it's really just a standardized version of HTML with HTML especially older versions of HTML you could really get away with quite a bit it was a very unstructured language you could do things in multiple different ways and there was really no structure to it there's really no standards applied to the HTML language however with XHTML it's not really a different language you're not typing a different language it looks just like HTML but there are a set of rules and standards that govern how you use HTML when you're when you're typing quote unquote XHTML and the leader for developing these standards is the world wide web consortium and the World Wide Web consortiums home page is w3.org so if you ever have any questions about the latest versions of XH what tags are still being used what tags have been deprecated if you want to know more about the standards associated with designing websites then this is the place to come this is the organization that specializes in developing these standards so that we have a more consistent use of HTML you hi
