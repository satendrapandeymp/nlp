all right now I want to talk about using the clone node method and other elements that you can use on your page as templates for content that you want to add later on so I have a little bit of a CSS right here that I'm applying to my page I've built a div inside my body I'm using the class advertisement to point to this little bit of CSS basically I'm just putting a box around it and sizing it I have a header tag and a couple of paragraphs that's all the content there is what I want to do is I want to copy this content inside of one of these sections there's two sections first one I'm gonna use to make copies of this place it inside of here and then later on we're going to use a script tag to create a template for content I've been a copy if I look in the browser this is what I've got so here is that div with the class advertisement it's just got a width it's got some padding it's got color set on the text and on the border that's all there is I want to take this and place a copy of it inside of that first section so on my script and waiting on content loaded I'm calling this function as soon as that event fires declared a bunch of variables that I'm going to use t1 t2 these are my two sections here target one target two those are the IDs so I want to place this div inside of here now if I were to create a variable let's say div 1 equals document very selector advertisement now I have this variable is pointing to this div right here if we were to say t1 appendchild div 1 what we're going to be doing is really just moving this div inside of here we're not creating a copy of it so I refresh don't see anything visually changing on the page but if we come in here and we look at the elements you'll see that my original div has moved from here to inside of this the section now contains docked if we just moved it from here to here so that's what this appendchild does find the original thing and move it if I try to create multiple copies of it just by doing a pen child I'm just going to be moving it around on the page so that's not gonna work for what we want to do we want to put inside here a copy of this original div so I'm gonna use the clone node method and I'm gonna start off with a false just to demonstrate what that does i refresh this I real this is the original we look at this there's the original div and then inside the section here's the div that I was copying with the clone note method this div now exists as a copy of the original one but because I put false right here this means it's a shell a copy it's not a deep copy I'm not copying all of the content inside of it if I change this to true then I'm copying everything inside of it as well so we'll change that to true come back to the browser refresh and there it is we have created a copy and we've put it inside of this section there we go now I put this inside of a loop so let's say let I equals 0 I less than 5 I plus oh yeah give one is the original I'm cloning it a deep copy and I'm appending it and I'm doing that five times i refresh there we go here's the first copy the second copy third fourth and fifth five copies of this the original still there but inside this section I have five copies that I've created so that's what the clone node does it allows us to create multiple copies very quickly all right I'm going to comment this out just to leave myself a little bit of space on the page coming back into my HTML I want to show you another way that you can create templates of content script tags their default behaviors to not display content on the page so we've created a script tag here but I change the type the type is not text slash JavaScript or applications last JavaScript or anything like that it's text slash HTML the content inside of this script tag is HTML now the fact that I've said it's HTML here is of minor importance I could have put text plain or I could have said text template or made something else up I'm saying it's HTML just because it's a more accurate reflection of what I have in here the important thing is that it is a script tag and the type says that it's not JavaScript so the browser's not going to try to run this script I'm going to make a copy of this script tag using the clone node method and then I'm going to extract this which is the inner text inside of here I am then going to tell the browser to convert that chunk of text into HTML and that will be my copy I'm gonna put the copy inside of this section with target 2 so T 2 I've already got the reference to that what I need to do now is I need to find the content that's inside of that script tag so let's say temp short for template that's going into you lose document query selector and then this right here I'm gonna use that to target it works as well as anything else temp will be this element right here I can create a clone of that if I wanted to do this multiple times clones always a good choice so let's say that no I didn't have a variable for that CLM that'll be my clone CL n equals temp dot come on node deep so I have a copy now of that script tag but it's not the script tag itself that's important to me it's the stuff that's inside of it I will now go to the dev - dev - is going to be my clone text content so I made a copy of that script I then took the script tags text content which is everything here all of that text is now what we have here now I'm gonna go to my target and I'm going to set its inner HTML property to this so div two right now right here this is a string that's being placed inside of this variable this string when passed to the inner HTML property the browser is going to want to parse the string and look and see hey is there anything inside there that looks like HTML while absolutely there's a div tag there's an h2 tag there's three paragraph tags all of that content that's defined within that string is converted to HTML because of using this property and now the contents of t2 will be without let's jump back to our browser and refresh this so we have section one if the one I took out the for loop and section two we have an error here to execute query selector not a valid selector oh yes of course square brackets the attribute selector and CSS requires square brackets around this attribute deep is not defined of course not this is a boolean truly is what we want to say and there we are I will expand this so I can see it close this copy and inside section two there we have it there is the content right here that was copied from the inside of this script tag so this chunk of text was placed inside here using the inner HTML property which converted it from the string into actual HTML so that's another way that you can approach this you can use script tags which by default will not be shown on the page set their type to something other than text slash JavaScript because that's what makes the browser want to interpret this as JavaScript and this will not be valid JavaScript so I'll get errors appearing in my console which will prevent my actual JavaScript from running so we use a different type inside of a script tag and then define the content that we're going to want to copy and place on the page one or more times in the future all right great if you have any questions please leave them in the comments and as always thanks for watching
