[Music] hi guys welcome to nourish a technologies we'll see another video session on particular features of html5 now I am discussing about new semantics completely clearly in html5 semantics popularly known as structural elements to construct a better document a better HTML document it is that so html5 offers almost all eighteen semantics these are classified into three categories general semantics Arabic semantics and the Chinese semantics general semantics are pati Arabic semantics to Chinese semantics three total eighteen semantics available now once we are entering into general semantics one by one then we can see section article header footer which group aside command details summary figure free caption and now and finally WBA so these thirteen one by one first let me explain about the first category section whenever you are seeing these semantics mainly we are using for a newspapers a designing purpose electronic newspaper designing purpose perfectly suitable and these features I am starting from section two so on for example section defines different kind of divisions they can say previously we are using do but right now the big place occupied by section of course we can use div inside section also there is a main point also we need to observe you body contains n number of sections section contains n number of articles an article contains n number of paragraphs so which is a superior section is the fastest period so I'm implemented here very clearly had a scooters or any other section it is a paid tag no specific attributes even though I will show you that example but before entering into only one one tag one one example together three four tags together I will show you an example for better understand section after I'm showing to you article article after hider header after footer so first we can observe article back this is html5 article article means lecture inside available it is used to represent an article article always an independent content it is related to a particular topic may be article we can say in forums in magazines in newspapers it blocks in different different areas existed article is a paid type an article open article close no specific attributes global attributes available event attributes available but specific attributes are not that then I am showing Hannah so in the header level what exactly existed so the element is used to display headers then you can think about h1 to h6 no that is not here if this header is different so this header particularly you are using for the friction so this element is used to display headers for some headings and I said once your information navigational sections or other controls exit it is also paid back letter open a header closed attributes element the specific attributes or none so like this you are having header header is their top and footer available in the bottom so next I am giving further clarity generally footer contains what frequently using links copyrights registrations trademarks differ different terms terms of usage and privacy and policy all these are available the footer level it is also a paid tag and put a rope and footer clause and there is no specific attribute so based on these four tags we can try to implement one example so once we are entering into example level commonly we are writing doctype you know already indicates washing information then we are writing HTML an information is equal to en - I already showed previously then a header section title I'm mentioning I'm saying html5 semantic now we can use inside that now simply first one section section inside article and section after also we can use directly header for example I'm writing power of html5 sir the head and article inside I need to write some text and I am closing section no article inside product ad number of paragraphs and article completion of the food all copyright please so here we are writing special characters already special characters issued special characters all edition observe this semantic structure once you are entering into body level first I started with the section section having heading whatever the text you want to can copy/paste here an article available article different different paragraphs article close so section related footer this is one simple example to you which is indicating the use of tags in your particular hierarchy then can't we use header in article level yes we can use there is there is no issue for example you are explaining about introduction introduction to html4 area yes we can use content right protected and I am using footer so write protected present registration and we can say right protected information now one observe previous and this one section level Hydra implemented I take a level Hydra implemented same like that footer available for the section footer available for the article so this is the real the meaning of what exactly the semantics these are semantics are using for a better structure what is the better structure meaning here there is a body body level previously we are using div for every purpose room only we are using you require one section also do your article also do so developer only aside also do so that do kind of uses is not there but a completely we are using semantic slimmin now some text so you can copy-paste here run it and check it perfectly how it is displayed but I am leaving for you some text so this is semantics uses of section header article footer next more semantics existed we can see that is nothing but H group one syntax whenever we are writing H group so each group indicates all headings from h1 to h6 should write only within the H group we must not write these headings other than H group it is one SEO fundamental rule all headings you should mention inside the H group head group how many 6a headings you need to write a by H group only so how we are going to write these six headings let me show that either more than one heading also we can are more they move that enter H group add that h1 simple I said h1 is JavaScript like the remaining headings also I want to copy paste for example I am changing any number of headings you can keep all six headings you can keep we don't of any objection that h1 h2 h3 h group so once you are going to run this perfect if you remove it you go browser you can't see change anything but it is semantic you need to understand semantic means sometimes a logical view sometimes the visual view so this is completely logical view because whenever h group is able to view so this such in your understanding inside headings existed so battle structure the meaning is now come to there is an upside available the next attack so after it is nothing but we can able to display the text existing text aside means either left or right for example after I am showing to you and a hello welcome to it is frame war WG and w3c like that I made if I run that some paragraphs I required here some texture let me copy paste I'm writing what is HTML so whenever HTML some text if you are running you want satisfied with this output because aside means what you are expecting not like this you are expecting this side or that side or middle somewhere else but displaying common one so aside by default in nature is left at that time as per your expectation answer you want to see means I need to write here compulsory style there is no other alternate style is the equal to color blue any color whatever we required and font started a talent then I am writing float I need for example left side I required with for example one 20 pixel so fun to family you required right that whatever font family you will just run it now everybody happy but is it really happens because of only html5 aside no I use again some cascading stylesheet properties I implemented so that it is satisfying perfectly now you are you're happy with that output whatever okay I said it means of a powerful asset game but how it is so that that properties you need to observe once again whatever I implement earlier now the same aside I want to display for my second paragraph but I need to change that one to green yes and I need to change that too right because already left existed now I'm refreshing that so what exactly you need to understand can we keep images yes images we can keep our to use videos in the real time industry you can observe any e-commerce website available mobile mobile related configuration are available some book are the book related I information something so this is as is perfect the uses of that for example you want to keep an image yes definitely now you can keep that image I am SRC equal for example I'm keeping dot gif and I said which is equal to hundred pixels simple I'm going to close that normal tag am implement so these many features not required right now just I can do that and font family also not required because I'm not using any font here just and refresh when simple image display like this aside is more powerful in the live environment using a side tag we can do more examples better you can go with that and next one afraid after we are using common tag is details summer it what is the meaning of details what is the meaning of summary actually summary is a field less than type simple if you are having idea and the details is showing what inside available done first let me explain about the details to my theory part yes it can be used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close it contains a different set of details we can do open and close the content of a details element should not be visible unless the open attribute is set now note point details tag is currently only supported Chrome and so on so and syntax now if you are coming to attributes level yes one attribute is there open now summary together we will do one example summary summary difference visible headings and almost I wrote it is a heading view either summer summary is the first node point I implemented here and perfectly right now supporting Chrome web browser and there is no specific attributes right let's we'll see practical with that so once we are entering into remove a side-story now I am writing details and details closed then summary summary closed I am giving here features of html5 inside we are writing features inside for example one paragraph you can take no problem so paragraph inside first feature i am writing html5 semantics second feature any number you can write noise and I am writing elements html5 for html5 multimedia html5 Abati's html5 then we can say like that any number of web worker that's okay so this is total information just we are going to open with this one with a browser so summary this is the title inside details available so how the manner it is displaying just we can try to check it once we are going to our browser to refresh just click just click same this kind of feature you can see the live environment also now you want to see the same feature by default open then you can write open equal to open now by default if you are not writing open by default is hide you will let it is a widget of that now you want to apply some colors you can use time sail attribute again and for example summary inside oil order list otherwise an ordered list we can use more clearly we can decorate that and close an order list and we can use order list inside Li yes once you change that apply now come on refresh yes and you want to apply CSS just go there style is equal to get impairment here also you can implement no problem styler is equal to color blue totally you can use and you can here also we require some color for example then go there and you can implement the details level or ordered strip style is equal to color right then once and for example you want to change the styles type available type is equal to square you can keep user-defined also no problem this is details summary so almost all the main major important level tanks are shown to you after this now tag existed whatever the anchors you are writing right inside now tank same like each group so all these are semantical rules for example your figure available whenever we are implementing images some are I am showing very clearly which are important right details so somebody completed next I am showing to you figure for example IMG source equal to html5 dot PNG just I am showing the directive that's that is image once the image available like that or you can now image should be figure fi g you re the same figure you can put it close that observe synthetically how it is going to refresh the margin padding auto adjustment is there if you remove the figure the responsive features automatically disappear refresh now so now I added that and I want to add one caption Forrest frigate caption it is another attack and free caption opened closed and html5 logo Fram water WG so I want to view that and I'm going to refresh and HTML file logo is that and feed the free caption inside the figure you use here so whatever free caption you use real figure caption is nothing but it should come bottom of the screen so but it is coming side so that time we need to implement image tag level simply for example I made one break so perfect alignment is there increase or decrease that bottom observe whatever the text you have given it speaker of that so this is recap like this semantics whatever 13 available in that main uses important one explained thank you for watching my videos and in taxes or other semantics and under video sessional discuss please log on to youtube.com slash Norwich City in the serrated channel each and every video session we kept related to all the technologies thank you [Music]
