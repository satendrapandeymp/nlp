hello guys welcome to my channel this is the tenth teetotal in this course and in this tutorial we'll check out the e/m and the strong ties with the emphasize and strong tags in HTML and as you can see I have my text editor up here and I have a file file open it's called - told - 10 dot HTML on line 1 I have a doctype declaration on line 2 I have the opening HTML tag on line number 10 I have the closing HTML time between these two I have the head section of the body section the head section has a title tag you know which has the text the emphasize and strong tags and then in the body section I have two paragraphs and you know then I have the e/m tag as well in the first paragraph and I have the strong tag in the second paragraph the opening as well as the closing times so the emphasized tag or the e/m tag in HTML just causes the text on which it is applied to be in you know italics so it just italicizes text whereas a strong tag just makes text bold now you know if you guys want to know why one would want to use these tags and not the bold that is the B or the eye tag I don't have an answer to that you know someone thought that these are tags that are important so you know they were included in the HTML standard and they're also very popular right and you would see a lot of developers discouraging you know people who use these tags now because they're deprecated no one uses them now but you know they were popular at one point of time and that's why you would see them a lot you know if you would check out code behind pages of websites on the Internet so this is how the file would look in google chrome the word emphasized in the first paragraph is italicized and the word strong in the second paragraph is inboard right so I didn't use headings for these because if I would have used heading for the second paragraph then the bold effect of the strong tag that I would have kind of you know been taken care off by the heading tag and I didn't want that right so that's it about the emphasized and the strong tags and I hope you guys are having fun in the course and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready assume the next door till then take care
