here I have a image called builder jpg and we want to be able to display that on our HTML page so let's learn how we do that the first step is of course to open up our directory structure and we want to place all images as we learned in yesterday's episode they should all be placed within the images folder so I will do that now now I can close this out return to my project and you can see that it is in fact being referenced so now let's reference that image and I'm going to hit enter a couple times and we'll paste it right here we use an image by using the IMG for image element because there will never be text within an image that this makes sense just as we did with links and meta elements we can self close it let's see what this alone does though in the browser and come back refresh and we don't see anything at all and that's because quite naturally there is no reference here so we have an empty image element it should be noted though this may not be the case in all browsers you'll find that in versions of Internet Explorer it'll display a nasty X meaning could not find the image so make sure that you aren't referencing empty images or images that do not exist in this case let's come back we can reference an image not by doing her f which you might expect by doing something called SRC that's source what is the source of this image that's going to be equal to a value and the source is going to be IMG forward slash builder now let's come back and if I load the page now we are referencing that image as we would hope we need to do one more thing for this image though it is a best practice and you should always do this provide alternate text for this image just in case the image is not available or images are turned off by whoever is browsing your web site they need to be able to have some feedback as to what this image represents and I will simply say construction hat and now if I load the page again you're not going to see anything but if I were to turn off image is you would see a little tooltip that said construction hat and that's really good for screen readers and things of that nature now we can also link to images that are stored on the web this is common if you use something like Amazon storage but there's another way you can do it and it's important that we go over this here's an image on net touch I'm going to right click it or ctrl click and choose copy image URL now if I come back I can link to an absolute URL by pasting that in and if I come back we can change the alternate text to and Votto and if I load the page as you would expect we are loading that image so you might think that's really helpful this is really a big no-no and the reason is we can build a whole website by referencing images that are stored on net Tut's or any web site but the problem is whoever owns net touch us in that case have to pay the bandwidth for displaying images on your website and that is not fair this is what's referred to as hot linking and it's a bad bad practice so please don't do it if there is an image on the web that you want to use and you have permission to use it right click save image as in this case we're going to save it to learning images and we'll call it in Votto and now we can reference it locally like so and we're not hot linking and Votto dot P&G come back reload the page and I am referencing it incorrectly and that's because I forgot to include the folder name go into the images folder then find it and now we are getting it but we are not hot linking and making somebody else pay for our bandwidth the only thing I want to caution you is again if you're going to do this you must make sure that you have permission to use images and it's not copyrighted so whether that means emailing whoever owns a website and requesting it or only using images that specifically allow you to redistribute them and use them any way you see fit so again to include an image we use the image element we specify a source that references where the image is stored and then we specify alternate text for when images is turned off in the next lesson I'm going to teach you about divs
