welcome to the eleventh video on CSS layouts we're going to add some buttons to our navigation bar so the first thing we want to start out with is HTML and so let's go to our div section in our HTML and as usual I already type some of this out so I'm just going to copy and paste in here and of course we start out with a unordered list element close it out and then we put a list element inside the unordered list element so each one of our list elements will be a button and then when we get to the CSS portion of this we will style each one of these buttons so right now this is just the raw HTML and we'll put in an href later when we get to master and content pages so for now we're just going to keep that empty we're just going to have the name of the button which in this case is just going to be the home button so let's go ahead and make a few more buttons so what else do we want well since this is a history site we want a section on ancient Greece so let's put a section on ancient Greece we'll have a button for that and let's do another section on ancient Rome and we'll add yet another button and we'll do a section on World War two so we'll have four big historical subjects and let's save our HTML and let's open up our web page and there you can see we've just got raw HTML right here where I HTML of course now we need to format all of these so these look like they're actually buttons not just raw HTML so let's close this out ok so let's deal with the CSS now now we're going to replace all of the CSS code we originally had for the navbar actually well we're going to I'm going to copy and paste right over this and then you guys can type it in we will actually keep the margin in the border radius but I've already typed it into the new code so I'm just going to copy and paste over this and here you can see we've got some new code here now I change the background color to black I'll show you this in a minute this list-style-type property gets rid of the bullet points so you need to set that to none and that gets rid of the bullet points we want to Center our button so we use the text align property we don't want a lot of padding because I want the buttons right near the edge of our navbar I think that looks pretty cool so we're going to put just a small amount of padding of five pixels and we'll keep the same margin and border-radius like I said so let's go ahead and save this and voila we've got buttons now in our navbar of course we need to style these now the first thing we need to do now is get these buttons to display side by side we do not want them at a top down order and these are being treated as block elements we want these to be displayed side by side so we need to create a new role to switch these elements to in line and we'll do that so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this and we will put an li element here and we're just going to use one role for this we're going to call this display and then we're going to say in line okay so let's hit the Save button and you will see now that the buttons are displayed side by side now a couple of things first you might ask why didn't we just style the nav bar itself why do we why are we styling the UL element and that's because I only want the box model remember the CSS boxes I only want that for the UL because I want the buttons to size right to the edge of the element now if we take this out you'll see and we save this you'll see that we get a box model now for the div and there you can see it now you might want that but I don't so we're not going to style the div we only want to style the UL so if we put this ul back in here we'll just get the box model for the UL as you can see right here and so I think that looks better now one more point here of course with this rule set we are styling the list element but it's good practice to put the path towards that list element in this case it's the UL so we start with the navbar of course we need that but we don't necessarily have to put the UL there we could have just put the li element and we would have got same results but it's good practice to put this in so you know the path from the navbar to the UL to the list element but I'll show you we can actually pull this out and save this and we'll get the same exact results there you can see we get the same thing but like I said it's good practice to put the UL in there so that you know the path okay that is going to do it for this video in the next video we will start styling the buttons see you guys
