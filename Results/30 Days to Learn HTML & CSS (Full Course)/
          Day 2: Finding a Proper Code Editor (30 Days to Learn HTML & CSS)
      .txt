before we continue on with formatting our text I don't want you to be using notepad or TextEdit that's a really bad practice these days instead we should use a code editor that was specifically made for writing code so I'm going to open up my browser and the one we'll be using in our lessons is going to be called sublime text 2 and I'm choosing this one because there are versions available for Windows Mac and Linux so more or less whatever browser you're using you should have an option available also it's a fantastic editor so go to sublime text calm and if we scroll down you'll see that there is a download link click that and that will download it to your desktop once you've done so simply open up the file you downloaded and here we are now yours depending on your OS might look slightly different from mine but it's all the same underneath the hood so I will take our file and drag it in like so now you can see in addition to offering quite a bit of flexibility there is syntax highlighting so we can more easily associate where our values are where our element names etc etc if you would like to adjust some of the settings you can always go to the app name preferences color scheme and you can play around with some of the options that are available whether you would prefer maybe a dark color or a light we're going to stick with light for this tutorial so I will switch that back like so now we're going to move ahead and learn how to format our text so notice here I have hello world but what if I want that really bold we want to shoot it out to the user well we can use a heading element to do that so I will type h1 and this says the text here should be a heading level one element that's the top most heading and generally that means it's going to be the largest it's going to receive the most weight when the browser looks at it but once again if we wanted to type here is my text let's save that I will go to file save or from now on I will type command s to do so and now I want to go back can view this in the browser now notice it says hello world and then it says here is my text so it is receiving this heavier weight the text is bold but this should not be bold as well that's not right let's go back and the problem is as we learned in the very first introductory lesson we did not close the h1 so the browser just assumed everything that followed it should be the heading level one so always remember to close this out and we use the forward slash to do it now if I save it and if I come back to Chrome reload the page now only this has received hello world and then we have our text let's view the source and this time I'm going to use the keyboard shortcut rather than view source on my Mac it will be option command u so I will do that now now notice everything is looking good it looks identical to what we've typed in but here is my text what is that well that would be maybe a paragraph it's a paragraph of text however it's always a best practice when you're creating HTML pages to specify to explicitly specify what your content is so here it's wrapped within the body you can get away with this but why don't we specify this is a paragraph of text so we do that by using the P element or tag I'll wrap that within P and now we're saying from the point of the browser it goes through here and says okay we have a heading 1 hello world and then we have a paragraph of text that says here is my text command s to save that come back and refresh and it's going to look the same to you but it's still following best practices and that's what I want you to do in this course now we're not going to cover too much of this until you've gotten a little bit further but I want you to keep something in the back of your mind how does the browser know that a h1 element should be this size this font and this font weight or meaning bold how does it know that and that's because browsers have some default styling in place so unless you override it when a browser comes across this it's going to say okay well I will generally make this bold I will make the font size much larger I will use this font now most of the time you may find that you don't want this but I want you to always keep this in the back of your mind the fact that this paragraph of text right here has a little bit of spacing above and the fact that the heading has a little spacing below that is all coded it's not done for you in this case the browser provides a default what we call a style sheet or CSS file that specifies that there should be what we call margins below so we'll get to that in a future lesson but for now just think about it next I want to add some emphasis to my so how can we emphasize a particular word we can do that by using the e/m element an e/m stands for emphasis so now we're telling the browser here is my text is a paragraph but this specific word needs to receive emphasis now what form that takes I don't know let's save it and view it in the browser refresh and now I want you to note that if i zoom in my is now italic again this is the default it's quite common most people keep it but the browser has set that by default any element that is emphasized should have italic text now what's the opposite of this well that would be strong meaning we are going to make this particular string or this particular word strong so here I will wrap here within a strong element and traditionally this is used to make text bold but it does not have to it can do anything you want while it's common to make an M element italic it can be anything you want at all there is no right or wrong just defaults refreshed and now can you see here is bold because we used a strong element my is italic because we used an M element notice this is what creating HTML is it's describing your content in Microsoft Word you can simply choose a font size a font color and then you begin typing when you press enter it will automatically add some spacing but within HTML we need to explicitly state that we're having a paragraph we have a heading here and what you'll find is while it might seem like more work at first I prefer it if I were writing a book I would honestly prefer to do it in HTML rather than a program like Microsoft Word and you might feel the same after a few months in the next lesson I'm going to teach you how to create
