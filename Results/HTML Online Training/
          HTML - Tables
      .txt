now in this video of HTML we will discuss about one of the very important tags in HTML that is tables as a name say table means it will be the table format comprising rows and columns inside it so basically the main use of tables in classic HTML is to arrange the layout of your web page so using the tables and you can even nest a table inside a table you can actually design a structure or a layout of your web page like what all you want to put on the top like logo or any tag line name of your organization after that in what way you want to put the content like some links than some image of whatever you want to put so using the different tags their little table and the different attributes a little table you can actually destruct your your web page so let's see a practical implementation of what all we have in your table tag in HTML so let's start with a very basic example of table so in this particular example what I have done is first of all I put a table tag followed by the border where I put the value 1 so basically we have already seen the border attribute in images where it was basically an outline around the image so here it will do the same thing with the table now in this particular table I want to use a couple of rows and in each row I want two columns so to do that what I have done first of all I have added one tr4 inside that we have put two TDs all right like first TD inside this I have put Row 1 column 1 another TD in which Row 1 column 2 so in the same row it will be two columns once we are done with this we will add another TR followed by two TDs inside as we have already done here so let's save this and come to the browser for the output so here you can see this is the Row one column one row one column two and again in the another row row two column one row two column two all right if you want you can add another row with this very same manner all right like one more TR I'm not changing the text so if I'll come you can see one more row out there by default the width of the table and these cells depend on the content which you are putting inside if you want to change the width you can actually give it a value like width is equal to 500 pixels all right so now it will be taking that particular size along with that you can observe like this text is actually getting started from the very means it's just connected to the borders or the edges all right if you want the to give some space between the text and the corners you can actually use the attribute called cell padding all right so in cell padding if you give any value let's say five so basically there will be some distance and now you can see there is some gap between the text and the edges of this cell similarly if you want to give some space between the two cells you can use another attribute called cell spacing so in cell spacing if I will give any value let's say five again so now the difference between the cell will be increased so these are the some common attributes of the table that is the cell spacing cell padding width and border now let's give some heading to each column of the table so for doing that if you want to show some data inside a table in a tabular format so you can also give it a heading and for doing the that particular thing what you can do you will have to add another row that is tr since it is heading it should be in the top of the table all right and now inside this we have put a couple of headings that is the tabular table heading this is tabular data and this is table heading inside a table row all right so now since the first column is containing the name I'll put a name followed by the salary all right so let's put any value so there are some data which I have entered all right let's come to the browser and refresh and now here you can see there is named salary which is the heading automatically they are centered alignment and they are bold and followed by the three records where each column is containing a name and salary so these are things which you can use for displaying a data in a tabular format but you can also do a lot of more things inside a table let's say if you want to merge two rules and or two columns or maybe more than two or columns so you can use the options called call span and row span call span to merge the columns while row span is to merge the rows so for that I will again use the initial table which we use for the introduction of the table reference all right let me add one more row out here so that will be Row 3 column 1 column 2 all right so and let's add one more actually column in all these three so three rows and three columns so column one column two column three let me do this in all the TRS so now this one is done let's see the output now so this is how it is looking like so let's say I want to merge these two columns now alright what I want to do is I want to merge Row one column two and Row one column three so for that what I have to do I will have to make changes in this particular column that is Row one column two so let's come here in Row one column two and here what I'll do since I want to merge two columns I will use call span in how many columns I want to merge this one and two so I will say call span is equal to two so basically after that this will be merged with this column so I will have to remove this column because the only column means this Row one column two is taking the space of two columns it is merging two columns and a single so I will remove this row one column three so let's refresh and see this particular column is taking the space of two columns in this particular fashion similarly if I want to merge Row one column two to Row two column one so a Row one column one to Row two column one I can do that as well so since here I was using call span here I'm merging two rows so it will be row span so again I will start things from here because this is the first cell in the list remember when I was merging these two columns so this was the starting cell when I am merging these two rows again this is the starting cell so I will make the changes only in this starting cell so let's come to Row one column one where I will use row span and in this row span how many rows I am going to merge since I don't have any bigger tables so I'm just merging two and two rows and columns you can create a bigger table and you can merge more than two rows and columns so here what I have done is there is gross man - so what it will do it will be merged from this and this so basically what I have to do I will have to remove this Row 2 column 1 so let's come here and remove this Row 2 column 1 save this and come to the browser and here you can see these two cells have been merged so let's add one more thing here this is how as we know learn this is how we can start merging the rows and columns now I can also add a caption out here this is merging cells example so whenever you want to put a caption to your table right after the table tag before these cells before any row we should add the caption so as similarly we have done here so let's come here and see this is the caption all right so this is merging cells example similarly if you want to change the color of your table you can use the BG color attribute alright so here in the BG color what I will do I'll use a color tan let's come here and refresh you can see the background of the color is changed to tan similarly if you want to put any background image you can do that I don't have currently have any proper background image so but if you want you can do using the background attribute I can pass an image so let's add the image called logo dot PNG which I used for the images example also which is nothing but it it rolls font logo all right it's not image its images so let's come to the browser again and let's refresh so here you can see the image is being added as the background as I said you should go for a valid background image which will give a Playland output to your tables similarly if you want to add the header or footer to be for your table you can do that as well with the tags called T head and T foot so what is that this is basically the head of the table this is the footer of the table alright so it is call span foe but I think I don't have so much calls so I'll just use calls Man 3 here because we just have three cells maximum in our table alright in a row so let us come here and refresh but first let me remove this image that is quite disturbing here so let's remove it here alright so here you can see this is the header this is the footer though I added this T foot at the top but since it was T foot it will anyhow go at the bottom alright so these are the different attributes and different tags inside a table which you can use for designing a table and as I said in the description you can use the nested table in order to make the designing of your webpages
