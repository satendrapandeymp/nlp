in this video we are going to continue on with effects in CS s now css3 allows you to add shadow to text and two elements in this video we are going to learn how to add shadow to the text in our webpage and in the next video we will learn how to add shadow to our elements using the Box shadow property but again in this video we're going to deal with the text shadow property so you can see here I just have two simple paragraphs with text and you can see them over here in the browser and so we're going to add some shadow to these and actually we don't really need to see the HTML anymore so let's just go ahead and close this out and let's just move our stylesheet over here and then let's go ahead and make our browser very very large there we go okay and actually you know what let's make it a little bit larger so we can see everything nice and easy okay there we go okay so let's work against this first paragraph and of course we're using an ID selector of text 1 so we've got the text pretty large here we've made it 60 pixels and let's go ahead and we're going to now add the text shadow property so we just use text - shadow that's all we need to do and then we're going to put in three values and I'll explain these in a minute so we're going to say three pixels here we're going to say three pixels here and then we're going to specify the color of the shadow that we want which is orange that's what we'll use for now now these first two represent the horizontal and vertical aspects of the shadow so the first one actually is the horizontal part of the shadow and this second one is the vertical part of the shadow usually you keep these the same but you can actually alter them if you want but usually they are the same so that's we're going to do here we're going to make the size 3 pixels for both and then of course the color of the shadow we specify here and again that is orange so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see we've got some shadow now behind our black text looks pretty cool doesn't it but it doesn't stop there we can actually add a nice blur effect to our shadow and we do that in this third spot here so we can specify again a pixel size for that and let's make it 5 pixels so again this third spot right here is if you want to add this blur effect to the text shadow so let's go ahead and save this will refresh our page in there you can see we've got some blur now if you really want to increase the size of it let's actually make this 20 pixels and we'll save this let's go ahead and refresh our page and there you can see the blur effect now is much larger now what if you want to add multiple shadows well you can do that you can add as many as you want so actually before we do that let's set this back to 5 pixels and in order to add another shadow effect we need to put a comma here and then let's just go ahead and copy and paste this right below and we'll just align this up and now here is where we put the semicolon so we'll put that right there so again we just add a comma if you want to add multiple shadows now let's go ahead and change the color we'll make this blue and let's make this one a little bit larger sometimes you want to do that if you're adding a second shadow so we'll set this at 6 pixels 6 pixels and for the blur we'll give it 10 pixels so let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh our page and there you can see we've actually got two shadows pretty cool now what if we wanted to add some transparency to our shadow well we can actually do that so we'll actually do that in this bottom paragraph here so let me go ahead and copy and paste what I have here so far and actually let's realign this a little bit so all of our CSS fits here there we go so again we're going to use a text shadow property but instead this time we're going to use this RGB a function remember we use that in the last video yes you will remember it's red green blue and of course this fourth parameter of course is the opacity that's where we can specify our opacity value so we're going to use blue but then we're going to add the opacity so let's go ahead and use blue and it is zero zero and 255 so we need to put 255 right here and then let's go ahead and specify what value we want for the opacity and let's just set that at the halfway mark and then let's go ahead and save this will refresh our page and there you can see let's go ahead and we'll bump it down a little bit let's give this let's set this to zero point three and there you can see it even has more transparency so that's how you use opacity with the text shadow property okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
