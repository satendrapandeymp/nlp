hello guys welcome to my channel this is the twenty-third tutorial in this course in this tutorial we'll be checking out how we can invite video clips on our webpages and you know in the last world we understood how we can include audio clips and the way in which you include video clips is very similar to how you include audio clips on the video element that we're going to use in this tutorial is in fact going to appear very similar to the audio element that we used and the entire setup in fact except that the video element is going to take few extra attributes and I'll I'll talk about those in in you know in just a minute so the HTML file that I have here has the doctype declaration on line number one and then between the opening and closing HTML tags I have the head section of the body section the head section has the title tags and the title of the web page is embedding videos in webpages then inside the body section I have you know the opening and closing h1 tags on line number seven and the text included would include between the opening and closing h1 tags is sending email to people using Python and this is actually the title of the video clip that I have included in the web page and then on line number 8 I have the video element so you have to type in video first give a space and then you can set the you know width as well as the height of you know the video clip as you wanted to appear on your web page so let's say I wanted to have a width of 600 pixels and I want to wanted to have a height of 400 pixels you know I'll have to type in width the name of the attribute the equal to symbol and then within double-quotes the value for it so and the value has to be in pixels right so 600 pixels is the value that I want the width attribute to have 400 for height and then you give a space and you type in controls and the significance of the controls you know attribute is that it allows you to play pause and seek forward backward adjust the volume and it allows you to do all that and then you know within the video element I have another tag the source tag for the video element and this is going to tell the browser where the file is what is its type and you know what is its name so you know the video file that I have used here you know I've called it video Road mp4 and I have it in the same folder as my tutorial files so this is the HTML document tutorial 22 told - 23 and you know the video file that I have used is also in this folder so it's right here it's called video and if I had it in some other folder then I would have had to go to the files location right-click on the file world properties and copy the file location like the entire path of the file and then paste it here as a value to the SRC attribute within the source tag right and then you also have to specify the type of your files so you know this is an mp4 file so that's why I have written video slash mp4 as a value for the type attribute and then I have closed the source tag using the forward slash and the closing angular bracket and then I also have a paragraph of text on line number 10 I have the opening and closing P tags and the text that's enclosed within these tags as your browser does not support this file or feature and this text will only be displayed if your browser fails to load this video clip for some reason right and this is how the file looks when I open it in Google Chrome all right so you see that you have this this this video clip and you can play it and I don't think you'll be able to hear much because you know I record my tutorials using a headphone which has a microphone so you know it's it's actually I can hear it in my headset but I don't think you would be able to but anyway it's playing and you can see that it's playing and you can also move forward in it you know you can adjust the volume if you want to and you can also you know you add you know you can maximize it you can view it in full screen mode and you can get back so these are all the controls that HTML offers and that's it for now I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I'll see in the next video in which we'll discuss more HTML features and more tags and that's it and take care
