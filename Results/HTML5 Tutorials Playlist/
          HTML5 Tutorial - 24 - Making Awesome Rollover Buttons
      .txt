alright guys welcome to your twenty fourth tutorial and in this video I'm going to show you guys how to use multiple animations and I'm going to make it really simple for you guys and show you guys how to achieve some amazing effects using just css3 no JavaScript no PHP none of that curve so the first thing I want to do is actually clear both of these things out the hover box which is going to happen whenever we rollover our box and also might as well get rid of this whole thing except block so okay of course it's blocking I'm going to be animating basically everything so let me adjust my chair say this and we're good to go so right now we had that thing not very exciting so the very first thing I want to do is since we're going to be rotating this I want to set the margin to 150 I think it was 50 before so I'm just going to put margin 150 pixels Auto that's going to center in the screen and move down 150 and I also want to change the color of the text I think was black before and there we go that's good right there and now I might as well give it rounded corners too because if square corners are not very appealing this is like the web 2.0 baby for rounding corners for life so WebKit if you remember this border radius I believe that's how to spell radius and I'm just going to give it it like 10 pixels might as well that seems good to me woah 2wz and what dub dub w WebKit comm don't think so alright so the very first thing we want to do is we want to set all the original properties now the first property that I'm going to be animating is opacity and I'm just going to set this to 0.6 now you don't use like any 0.6 pixels or anything just 0.6 so that's going to make it like kind of transparent now I want to set the background color we'll just give it something simple like red and we'll be animating it into a nice blue color so that I want something you know not like blue and green because that's kind of close in color now I'm going to set the original width now the width I'm just going to go ahead and set this as something small like Audrey and 20 pixels and we'll go ahead and we'll grow that later as well as the height so the height is going to be 75 so this is pretty much an average sighs the button of 120 by 75 pixels and if we go ahead and look at it right now we can see that okay that's our button when you roll over it nothing happens rounded corners white text yeah data2 all that good stuff so now what I want to do is I want to set the animation on all the things we're going to animate so remember whenever working with animations we write WebKit I need to shut up while I type this transition hopefully I spelled that wrong oh man I correct myself up sometimes okay now the first thing we're going to animate is in here I'm just going to go ahead and write all the properties of things we're going to change we're going to change WebKit transform like before and we need to write the time of each animation individually so we're going to transform we're going to rotate this just like before and that's what transformation I'm going to use we're also going to be changing the opacity and that transition is going to take two seconds we're going to change the background color and that's going to take two seconds and we're going to change the width of the button and that's going to take two seconds everything is going to take three seconds by the way and the height whenever we change that that should take two seconds now with that being said make sure got only calm is in the right place before I fudged this up all right so now that we have all the things that we on want to animate we want to say okay whenever we hover over it how do we want to animate them or how do we want them to change well if we just use a little copy and paste technique we save ourselves some time well I just got like a dry hair ball in my throat alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to transform this piece now the transformation we want to do and you don't have to do yours exactly as mine you can you know mess it up a little bit but I'm just going to rotate mine 360 degrees and this is going to spin it in a full circle now the next thing we animated is opacity so if we copy this and paste it the original value was 0.6 and I just want to change this we'll just give it a simple pesty one which I believe is the default and now we want to change was next the background so we'll give a background of music cool color that I know of we'll give that a hexadecimal value one ec7 east six don't even ask me how I know that but I do and the width how we need to make a wider so for width will give us something like 450 that should show up nice on my screen recorder a lot bigger and for the height would just make it slightly larger will give it like a value of 110 pixels and I forgot to put pixels up here let me just make sure it pixels pixels red okay everything looks good to go right now so remember whenever you work with your transition or animation make sure you go through and you have all these things that you changed so whenever you click it you should have one highlighted on top and bottom c.width top and button light top and bottom you see what I'm saying so without further ado let's go ahead and refresh this and hover over it and see what we get how awesome is that so let me go ahead and talk to you guys about all the things I animated first of all it's rotating we can clearly see that the opacity is changing although that may be a little hard to tell so let's concentrate on the background the width in the height now whenever you roll over this guy you can see the background obviously changes now look at the width and the height of the button right now the height doesn't change that mud so it may be kind of subtle but the width definitely changes so all of those things I assure you are indeed animating so that is the beauty of css3 and how you can make awesome button effects and if you look at this check it out before we would need to have some JavaScript code in there and you know a bunch of functions and you know another scripting language and it got to be a whole mess but how amazingly simple is this where you can just say okay this is what I want to start at this is what I want to end at and I'm just telling you how long the animator right there it is so easy even a caveman could do it so with that being said that is how you animate very simple animations that you can actually make very awesome looking animations when you combine them using css3 so that being said don't forget to check out my website I just updated it with all my new stuff and it's the new Boston org so go check it out tell me guys what you think and yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe
