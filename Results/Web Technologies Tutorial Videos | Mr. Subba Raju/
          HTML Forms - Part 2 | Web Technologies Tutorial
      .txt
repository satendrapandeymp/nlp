hi guys welcome to nourish a Technologies this is Subaru in this video sessions we'll try to observe forms little advance a level radio buttons checkboxes field set legend HTTP HTTP method attribute related parameters get post and what are the HTTP status message is available initial observe radio buttons in the first video session up two radio buttons have taken general if you observe any live application any real-time application these radio buttons commonly we are using for general selection or for example sometimes product to selection where a single selection required there we are going for the radio buttons now practically we can observe already some structure I developed and on in that when I am writing form from open form closed form inside action commonly available I will try to show you this action also today NIT one dot HTML file already created so commonly name available for Java suit purpose my form better single quotation double quotation can maintain standards ID also you can provide Java suite purpose ID is equal to my form or form one symbol net right inside label select your gender select your gender le label simply one break tag and the input type is equal to radio name is equal to just our day said any name you can keep then value is equal to just I said mail not compulsory may limit right let me show you one by one female next one is others right three radio buttons ready selective or general I label if you want to paint little bit colorful means just you can apply style attribute also this is comes under global attribute cascading stylesheets just I'm making that color style is equal to come to a browser run that selective or gender male female others for example my gender is male I am selecting right if not select the female if not select others automatically female D selected the same sinner in the real-time applications we can see but if you are doing this small mistake in your source code what the mistake already are d1 or d2 like that you applied and if you are going to run on your web browser that and now if you are selecting male selected you selected female selected and you selected others selected this is meaningless so remember in radio buttons name attribute must be similar then only it works effectively now we can observe that by going to source code and we can remove that yes yes perfect now now by default some websites male selected of course some websites we may selected and now I am giving check is equal to check whenever you are developing check is equal to check and refresh that so by default male selected so this is simple radio button easily be selected at the same time some competitive examinations time also radio buttons they are using but a better competition exam examinations time we need to use checkboxes sometimes multiple answers correct so that time radio button singular allowing multiple not allowing so checkboxes same definitely I will show you that now second control is checkboxes now select your course or courses one you can select more you can select no issue radio button level I am using checkbox simple one name is equal to CK value is equal to dot compulsory okay cap symbol e HT and first cause I am giving HTML right the same line I want to duplicate without writing multiple times now check it doesn't require actually first one all I am selecting and the next remaining I am i moving to duplication right first HTML next html5 and next one is css3 next one is CSS for and bootstrap like this several courses I kept now once you are doing like this change HT one just to see es name is value not compulsory okay but our satisfaction purpose I'm using same checkboxes also and whenever same available different awhile will also noise right first one only checkbox check the value remaining all our plane and refresh that so by default selected that and remaining already selected you can select one course you do not want to select I want this one and this one yes perfectly selected so neatly and in a meaningful way arranged no like is like I wanted descriptive cosines so that time you can apply break just be are you know already this right BR you can apply one two three just you can come into here and apply of course HTML file level also you can apply that BR type just so you want to select two items select you want to deselect deselect so this is so this is the best one and this is a check boxes right radio buttons we did checkboxes we did and after that one we can observe feel the second legend and whenever we are talking about the fieldset fieldset is nothing but fields it defines a group of form elements as being logically related so when logically related that time this fields that we are using the browser draw a box around the set of fields to indicate that they are related logically it is a paid attack of course patrons were calling container but it is a paid tag Metro would say wait and it is a paid tag field open field clothes available let me take same field and I am taking to my previous example you are available so break also can use non break also you can use break if you don't want you can remove it one two and whatever break available remove it just I want to show you field set form inside unit yes form inside we need and from before we required fields it just to close that yes it is giving a boundary observer is a given nice border and here's some Adamic will be opened here yes close that so this is field set now on this field set I want to display as a title this one that is a legend what exactly the meaning of lesson so lesson it uses with field set to give it title to eat the set of fields it is a paid tag now the legend I am taking now the same lesson having attributes and parameters also it is a paid tag and three parameters one attribute available right center now I am coming back to that and let me field set inside a legend and close that it same label whatever available to get out I don't want yes label level this one also doesn't require how I am modifying in front of you and just observe put your lap in front of you can practice also by seeing my video just you can refresh excellent it is giving a title for that time so whatever the logically related items you said the title neatly came now I made this one Center definitely you can make so align is equal to attribute you can apply a line is equal to Center C and T are and you can perfectly now you want to apply here colors definitely we can apply colors are playing is cascading style sheet mechanism easily we can apply that now you want to apply here then just you can go for style equal to previously whatever I implement here same thing style is equal to for example you want to see red color is is perfectly so like this you want to change even field set also yes style is equal to I am saying border to pixels solid hash and required color whatever the color you decide same color any color you can use color code you can use color name you can use for example you want to see border radius R it bit differently definitely differently means twenty pixel yes more different is coming so we can do even double dash like that also solid available you want double lines for example so I'm using double lines so this is the way we can apply so even this one also we can apply colors you'll see in cascading style sheet classes now I said field is it legend also field is it making a border legend of making title but before I did checkboxes multiple selection possible that before I did radio button single selection possible now we'll go to form level action attribute we can see and a method related HTTP and that is also required just observe so what are the main controls available already observed I am closing that so come to HTTP so we'll observe introduction to HTTP what is it so commonly full-form you know once again I no need to explain to you but I can say one one one point about your HTTP it transfer hypertext documents in the World Wide Web it is taking HTTP requests it is giving HTTP response so in web environment architect is a common request response and when you are talking about communications between kinds and server HTTP designed especially for that now it is designed enable communications between client and servers but when it is taking request so it is following the method attribute two parameters one is a get another one is the post what a Getty is doing and what a post is doing now practically we can see what is exactly HTTP now if you are observing this picture from browser to request going on I made all heads multi-headed left to right is a request right to left is response so HTTP requests going from client to server response coming from server to client you want to observe this architecture very clearly please refer my video to in web technologies I explained very clearly in that architecture presentation layer layer level technologies business logic layer layer level technologies data access layer layer level technologies I made a very clearly simple in that video so this is HTTP so when it is taken from browser to server it is taking time get using or post using so when get important then post important but both are important so never recommend get never recommend post situation wise client a requirement wise client business rules wise both are important now now close this diagram we understood that and come to action attribute as I said action means destination and this attribute use it to specify URL of the server page means what for example I am opening one Facebook application I am opening simply once a facebook application displayed I want to speak about that here I open facebook.com webpage just to control you view source code location you can go there once if you are going to view source code location control a find and simple you can say action is equal to once you are saying action once you entered username and password your facebook login page is submitting your credentials to login dot PHP that means this is the destination of your submit once you enter a required data in the login form where should submit which is server to submit those values those credentials so that is called action attribute same thing periodical I made in my notes very clear points for that one specify the URL of the server page to which we want to send our form data form name ok action is equal to I submitted in this case aspx means dotnet JSP or PHP as you like so it is most important relevant information related to that now I am coming here whenever you are using method so method attribute having two parameters first one get at least let me explain first what is get client-server whenever data is moving from client to server HTTP so method attribute it is a form level of course method attribute having two parameters in that one get first in this method we do not have security for our data only limited data can send from client to server we are unable to send use data Mac zimwi can able to send 2048 characters to zero four eight two thousand forty eight characters this is the default method of the fam and it can carry raw data from client to server raw data sense user understandable format the data which is understandable by user is called a raw data means whatever you entered same data transferring it is not encrypting maybe your network anybody attack so your username password clearly visible to that now where get method when to use get mirror actually so syntax implemented action method is equal to get if you didn't write method is equal to get also default that one only information sent from a form with the get method is visible to everyone I wrote maximum length limitation and the variables displayed on URL how displaying a note point get should never be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information so this is actually information now in this one in this one a small example already prepared just for a better understanding no need to write because the several login forms already implemented we required time here just I am removing completely body level just add same login form level username password submit button reset already completed in the previous video session also totalize shown to you that is it in simply I copy/paste earlier good and I am giving here method attribute else a simple not compulsory but meaningful way I'm writing code every point method is equal to get available observe so save that come to your web browser close this is already we observe that refresh perfect username password sign-in cancel for example entering my username yes my name is and my password I'm entering the password is what password ended you do not know because it is completely typing in hidden format but how many characters maybe you can expect but what I entered I only knows once if you are clicking on the Sign In button that and your username password completely visible here this is the main drawback of get method so where it is showing person to you there I implemented space also so to avoid this drawback and get method not suggested in the confidential areas where sensitive data required I wrote some point get requests can be cached yes get requests remind in the browser history as I shown to you its source we can bookmark that one when request should never be used with dealing sensitive data so in this situations get is not suitable but where get suitable where lesser data you need to carry get easy excellent performance because it is carrying less data from trying to do server so try to understand get is other than authenticated areas other than sensitive areas other than security areas get is a perfectly suitable we're less than 2048 characters that available now we're a second parameter we can observe post in this method we have security for our data it can send bulk of data it can carry encrypted data from client to server mission understandable format but a method is equal to post it is not default we need to write method is equal to post and to use post very clearly mentioned and I said method is invisible to others at the same dimension here multi port binary input now I am going to take that same example I'm not anything just post that sir so in this example if I try to refresh my example I am entering simply my username my real password I am entering here entering my real password if I click Sign In button it is taken to my destination action but nothing visible to you here it is called hiding the data internally this is encryption and where exactly post is suitable I made some points also very clearly here post requests are never cashed no history cannot be bookmarked and last one have no restrictions that means you can send bulk of data there is no restriction like Getman get one right what is the difference between get and post I made some points also already in my explanation whatever the points I mentioned same points a gate level post level in gate level very clearly visible data on URL address in post level not visible unsecured highly secured excellent performance good performance transfer limited amount of data huge amount of data we unable to upload files we can upload files can be cached cannot be cached so this is completely related to HTTP method attribute get and post parameters finally before I am going to close this form related examples we are commonly getting some kind of error messages for example I opened my internet I said an Irish IT dot-com I type it like that one URL once you are typing that URL and it is opening now I typed a forward slash for example Raju dot HTML I typed I know already that that web page is not there but even though it type so once I type with Raju dot HTML it is giving 4 0 for page not found that is a technology split and something but it is giving so 4 0 for error always related to clients error how I said that one so the these errors are called HTTP status messages as per w3c standard these error messages are classified into five different types one double X double X in the sense zero zero that meaning one double X - one double line one category - double X - 2 double line another category 3 double X - 3 double line other category for develops to four double line another category five double X - 5 double line least last category so every category they provided some range to us for example one develops - one double line related to information related messages - develops to two double line successful messages 3 double X - 3 double line redirection messages for double X - 4 double line client-side related messages 5 double X - 5 double line server related messages or server-side messages so these are the HTTP status messages I hope you enjoyed lot in this video session related to forms thank you watching my videos catch me for more videos on youtube.com slash
