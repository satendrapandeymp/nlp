in this video we're going to take a preliminary look at functions and actually we're going to spend the next several videos examining functions because they really are the key to understanding JavaScript and so we've got our J s file open here in notepad as well as our webpage dot HTML that we've been working on so let's flip back to our javascript file and as I said functions really are an important part of JavaScript along with variables they form the basic blocks of JavaScript now functions are simply a set of statements that we group together that perform a particular task or function and really it's a way of organizing your JavaScript code you wouldn't want to have hundreds of statements all over the place because it would become unreadable functions are not only a way to organize your code but also reuse your code over and over again because it makes sense that if you do one particular function on one part of your webpage you may need to use that function over and over again so that's really what it's all about reusing your code and so you can put one statement in a function or multiple statements and in this video we're just going to do a very simple function to get us started now to identify a function we simply type in the JavaScript keyword function and that identifies it as a function to JavaScript so let's do that and then you can name the function whatever you want so that's similar to a variable you can call it whatever you want now like a variable I recommend that you name it something relevant in other words whatever that function does so we're simply going to call this function say something now I should point out that the naming convention for functions is very similar to variables you can pretty much use any naming convention you want but you cannot put numbers in front of the function so if we put an 88 in front of this it will not work and you can see the intellisense it turns our name to red that will not work so that's really the main caveat about naming functions so let's get rid of that 88 now after the name we need an opening and closing parenthesis and this is where we pass data into our function and we're going to talk about that in the next video but for now we're just going to leave this empty but again if we want to pass data into our function we use the parentheses and again we'll talk about that in the next video okay so after the parentheses we need curly braces and this is where everything gets going in terms of the function all of the statements that we create will go inside these curly braces and so let's put a comment in there all statements go inside curly braces okay now let's create a statement for this function and we're just going to do a simple alert and we need our parentheses and then we're just going to send a string and we'll say this is a function nice short sweet and simple and then of course as always we need to close the statement out with a semicolon now the key point here and what differentiates a function from just a normal statement is that the function by itself will do nothing we actually have to call this function in order for it to run so again if we don't call this nothing happens on our webpage so in order to call this we simply have to go outside the function and type in the function name and we just put in parentheses here semicolon and let's save this and let's go over our webpage and let's run this and there we get the alert this is a function now I will say JavaScript is all about tying functions to events we will get to events much later on but at a basic level that's what you're doing in JavaScript you're tying a function to a particular event so it could be a mouse click it could be a keyboard stroke it could be playing a video on a website anything and everything is open game to make your site interactive so as I said that's really the key the basic key to understanding JavaScript you're simply tying functions to events and as I said we will get to that much later on but I just wanted to make that point early on now in the next video we're going to talk about these parentheses and passing data through here so I will see you guys in the next video
