we're going to talk about traversing the Dom one more time in this video now in the previous videos we've talked about going from parent to child and then in the last video we went from child to parent in this video we're going to go sibling to sibling to sibling and you can actually go to the right and you can go to the left so this doesn't involve the parent-child relationship we're at the sibling level and we stay there so again we're just going to go from sibling to sibling to sibling okay so let's take a look at the code here first let's take a look at the web page and I've just made a minor tweak here I moved the ID to the second paragraph element because we want to go backwards and forwards and so let's flip back to the JavaScript code and start filling this in all right so I'll go ahead and copy and paste the first line here and you can see we're just using get element by ID to get the second paragraphs ID and we're just going to store that again in the para two variable and so I'll copy and paste the next line here and we're going to create a variable called sibling and of course we're going to use the para to object and what we're going to do is specify next elements sibling and so we're going to go to the right so this should pick up the third paragraph which of course is the sibling of the second paragraph and then we're going to do what we've been doing the last couple videos we're just going to change the text to blue but again that's not the point of this lecture we're interested in this new property okay so let's go ahead and save everything up and let's see if this works and we'll go launch this in chrome and there you can see the third paragraph text is changed to blue alright so let's go back to the JavaScript code and let's make a comment here so you can have this as an example and we'll just copy and paste this entire line here and so the next property we can put here is previous element sibling and I think you know what that means so we'll just save everything up here and let's go ahead and run this and if we click our button there you can see the previous sibling of the second paragraph which is the first paragraph of course is now altered okay so one thing I want to point out here before we go is that you can actually get rid of this element yes you could just use the previous sibling property and the same thing for here you could just say next sibling but remember you'll run into those whitespace nodes if you do that remember once you pull the element out of here you will start hitting those whitespace nodes so I do not recommend that you do that I recommend that you use these properties that have element in them because it's really kind of difficult to deal with those whitespace nodes okay that's going to do it for this video in the next video we are going to start looking at form validation a huge subject in JavaScript see you guys
