you hi guys welcome to nourish high technologies this is a barrage in this video session we'll try to observe frames what is a frame why frames required frame set frame no frames how these packs are functioning on the webpage we'll observe first one what is a frame frame is nothing but a kind of border to divide a page into multiple frames and using frame set we can divide the webpage using frame we can call the resources to the webpage now first initially frame set who developed this concept this concept developed by Netscape corporation to show multiple resources on a single page due to several reasons in the industry right now we are not using frame set but even though this video session making you very clear regarding frames HTML frames mainly now frame set using this tag we can divide our page as a multiple frames it is a paid tag paid tag means opening available closing available that related attributes rows percentage pixels calls pixels a percentage border pixels border color color name you can use color code you can use so this is a frame set only frame set we are unable to call resources that time we are using another tag frame frame is a non-paid tag it is used to call external resources it has several attributes non-paid tag several attributes available source name scrolling source means file path name any name scrolling s no default first we'll concentrate on these two areas come to source code environment HTML frames writing frame set frame set once a frame set opened closing required so frame set inside frame available fr AME frame frame inside first attribute is SRC source is equal to and I am providing source is HTTP ww.topdentistsonline.com 50% initially I am using percentage so in this simple example what I try to show this is my page for example I am putting rows like this and this is rows attribute this is first 50% this is second 50% first 50% RHIT dot-com second 50% Seshat go this is what exactly output will come but really output coming or not like that practically we can see right save that title I open body level all are correct everything open but output coming or not right refresh the webpage no output here we did one small mistake frame set doesn't required a body section when you are keeping body tag frames unable to run come back to source code remove body just body down now we will try to refresh perfectly working this is rose up urban area tea calm lower once a show jobs not go so simple point you need to understand that is a default in nature of the frames frames never required body part where required definitely will see example this is these are the two websites one is nourish IT calm another one is job Hotel nourish IT job hotel Sasa jobs come visit for latest updates latest IP jobs every second we are updating and latest batches information this is our upcoming batch information now come down that and available every information completely so this information we can able to view means in a single web page where we can able to see two resources three resources for resources n resources right now to resources available come back and there is another attribute available calls equal to I am providing 50% comma 50% means one the page horizontally one line what take a live online and means practically what happens like this and first line is like this coming and second line is like this coming this is columns this is rows first website is coming here second website is coming here next third website is coming here next fourth website is coming like this a page we can divide it into multiple frames so now that resources we can provide I am providing another website Necker services comp and other website nourish i TDOT in now i am providing here knackers another one is nourish IT dot the in now total four resources I provided and body is not there here body another environment I will show you where body required now I am going to run how this is dividing observe four parts perfectly four parts available one two three four like this we can able to view multiple resources on that so for resources perfectly open due to some problems that is not open for resources perfectly open now come back come back to our original resource now if I provide this one is a forty percent if I provide this one is as to it yes your exploitation correct left side forty percent remaining 60 percent right sir we'll take this is also one kind of opportunity to provide as trick means special character save it and refresh it observe it is adjusting adjusted so four parts available this part Bora Belle because this is tea person this is 40 percent now good and for example I am opening two websites practically to show you some more in detailed manner remove columns come to 50 percent right I am refreshing my web page two parts perfectly displayed now once you are coming back here by default to scrolling available observe this is also scrolling available and even this is also scrolling available now scrolling attribute of one two applied first one I want to say scrolling is equal to s of course by default and I can say same scrawling attribute on your second URL scrolling is equal to I said no so as per our exploitation first one displace second one should not be mean second one absent right refresh and the same webpages opening and first one already presented and here scroll bar able to see clearly but whereas here scroll bar is not there because you implemented attribute scrolling is equal to know so what attributes we did clarity purpose let me show Rose we did calls we did border border color pending available and source we did again name pending scrolling already we did now I am showing before that third tag no frames available because body already there I am not using like this body empty available aim as in my browser not supporting frames that time we are using another tag is called no frames no frames is a paid tag once no frames inside whatever the text you are writing for example paragraph oops your browser unable to support frames so whenever you are writing this message if browser supports frame spot will be displayed if browser not supports a body part will be displayed no frames always write in body section it is a most important note point so body section contains no frames part so it executes when frames are not supporting it executes when frame supporting means this example pretty clear if supporting body part if not supporting non body part so example is very clear so this is no frames attack total frames are classified into three types frame set frame no frames frame set up a tagged frame non-paid a row frames also paid tag now I want to show you more examples these formalities does not require by default remove it this is already understood whenever not supporting this part will be displayed if you want a color also mention style is equal to color red save it and this part will be displayed in that color that means ever browser not supporting right body part awesome display removed only frame spot available no scrolling by default s no scrolling by default s that Sun my plain example I want to show you without no body no head nothing perfectly running of course real-time industry purpose like this examples not recommended but we can practice practice purpose no restrictions required so by default nobody available no head available of course HTML document default a section is a body but in frame set default section is frames at only so frames had opened frames are closed now here two attributes pending the attribute is nothing but border is equal to border is you want more thickness border is equal to pixels and I am running observe this border very lean available now I want block means thick level and now the border is showing little bit thick level may be that much visibility is not there Water visibility is there but visibility is not that much good now that time we are implementing border color attribute border color is equal to I said blue simply color name I wrote come and refresh that now visibility available thickness available so completely showing to you now you want to increase the border thickness I will come back and I am writing that 30 pixels for example right the refresh now you can observe once i refresh to see the thickness so border property making thickness or light border color making that visibility very clear so this is border border color these frames are providing these many facilities these many resources we can able to see on the webpage but unfortunately these frames are not using in html5 environment because frames not a compatible for latest gadgets and widgets that is a main issue because of this reason in latest web environment iframe tag entered before we are discussing iframe tag at least we can see what are the disadvantages of frames existed we can able to view so there are the number of disadvantages available these many disadvantages we can able to view these disadvantages are making frames or not recommended in the latest of AB environment so once you open a single web page multiple resources may be 6 websites we open I want to copy 6 website URL not possible I want to see 4th website history not possible I want to see 2nd website last page or next page our total web page I want to take printout so these many restrictions existed in the frames that is a reason frames not recommended in the advanced of AB environment as I said already these frames occupied by iframe tag but in this video session I made already each and every point related to frames very clearly practice whatever the examples I shown to you in finally I am providing one point to you also managed IT dot-com you open dot in your pants a shore job comm you open a natural services.com you open all these are nowadays technologies feather companies if you try to open one Google Doc or dot in when Gmail application one bing.com are one Yahoo dot co-taught in like this websites you are trying frames unable to when unable to support those websites practically we can see that example now come back and we can try to check it remove all the things because already you got a clarity here and save it now I am opening google.com in I am providing more clarity and I am opening here another website for example Yahoo dot collating or bing.com anyone any other web said you can take even facebook any kind of just bing.com i said now i am coming back and i am refreshing another browser i am taking and refreshed just yes once you refresh bing.com open but google.com saying so google itself giving very clearly one clarity frames doesn't have any future right now I am not working using frames that is the indication so maximum websites already out of frame set out of frame so when frame set and a frame not available there is no discussion about the no frames so this is a main error also may be where you are practicing other websites you will get this kind of doubt that is the reason in this video session that doubt also I made very clear definitely in advanced video sessions I will discuss with you what is the functionality of the iframe thank you for watching my videos for more videos catch me on youtube.com slash Nareesha tea
