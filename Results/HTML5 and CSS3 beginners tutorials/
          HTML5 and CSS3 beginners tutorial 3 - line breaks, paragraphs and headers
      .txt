hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's ania and welcome to you tutorial number three and in this tutorial we are going to start taking a look at certain things that we can put in the body of our webpage okay so the first few things that we're going to talk about in this tutorial are the line breaks paragraphs and headers okay so if you guys watch the last tutorial you probably saw this and you thought okay well we can just go ahead and put any text in the body like I'll just go ahead and I'll write some paragraphs out here so this could be paragraph 1 this paragraph 1 and you think okay well I can break down two lines and this could be paragraph two and then we'll write another story over here or whatever and then you think okay cool I'm going to go ahead and save this and I should get three nice paragraphs printed out in the browser but unfortunately that's not the case okay so if I go ahead then I launch this in Firefox you can see that I've got all three things printed out on the screen but they all appeared in one line what the heck is going on here well let me explain it to you this way HTML is actually whitespace insensitive so it doesn't really matter how much space we leave in between yeah I mean I could put in a hole what is that like probably 20 inches or something and when I go back and I click refresh nothing's changed okay so that's why we use these things called tags okay they basically tell HTML how to mark up the text inside of them okay so to break down one line what we do is we use this break tag so that is BR with a forward slash just like that and if I want to break down another line then I go ahead and I put one there as well okay so now when I save this and I go back to Firefox and click refresh you can see we've got this on line one this on line 2 and line 3 ok so they're all on their own separate lines but that's actually just how to break down a line so this is the equivalent of hitting enter on your keyboard but if you guys actually want to have paragraphs and paragraphs have spaces in between these two lines then we have to go ahead and we use a different tag called the paragraph tag so to do that you're just going to go ahead and put in a smaller than and greater than sign with a P and same thing on this side as well okay so that is the start of one of our paragraphs and then this is the end of that paragraph okay so we'll go ahead and we'll do that a couple times ending P and we'll start this P over there and and why P over there ha ha that was sounded kind of wrong but hey we'll go back and click refresh and now as you can see we've got these three pretty cool paragraphs all printed out nicely on the screen with space in between them okay so that's quite cool we've covered how to actually break down one line and we've also covered how to make different paragraphs so let's take a look at how to actually make headers on the web page okay now we actually get six different kinds of headers by default okay and they are actually named h1 just like that right down until h6 so we've got h1 h2 h3 out of habit I put a closing tag h4 h5 and h6 not H 56 just h6 okay and obviously when you have to go ahead and end these as well so I think what I'm going to do is just copy that paste paste paste paste paste okay so one two three four five okay and we can go ahead and just type some stupid stuff in here to see what all these headers come out looking like so this would be the biggest header h1 is obviously the biggest and then h6 is going to be the smallest and a somewhere around h3 that's almost the same size as like the default text what might be h4 so that would be like a medium header as the text will test text whatever will have a few typos in yet h2 can just say tomatoes because I have run out of things to type and h5 can be fears is my favorite champion ten points for whoever guesses UEFA's is let's go ahead and save this and now when we go back to Firefox again and click refresh you can see we've got all six headers print it out on our web page starting from h1 being the biggest and h6 being really really small that you can't even see it okay so those are the different headers that we have available to us in HTML but we can change these up a little bit which we will learn about later on in the series but for now that's how to make a header in HTML so thank you very much guys don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys in the next video
