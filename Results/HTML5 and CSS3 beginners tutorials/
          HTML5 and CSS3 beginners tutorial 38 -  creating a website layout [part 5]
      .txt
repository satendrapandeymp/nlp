hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 38 and in this tutorial we are going to continue looking at part 5 of our basic website layout miniseries okay so hopefully you guys watch the previous videos hopefully you've got pretty much all of this code and if you guys can remember correctly we actually left off with the web that looked kind of like this so we had our logo the bar I mean all the stuff and this really ugly border all around yeah so one thing I want to do is get rid of this border and continue working on the page but there is also one mistake that I made in the previous video which I just want to correct real quick so go over to CSS and over here where I've set the header nav article section and footer tags to be displayed as block 1 tag that I forgot about was our aside tag so we just need to go ahead and take care of that aside and now that should be displayed as a block as well like I said most newer browsers will actually treat these tags as blocks but if you come across a older browser it might not treat them as older blocks I mean as a block so yeah okay okay now the next thing I wanted to do was actually get rid of this border and if we save that now and go over to Firefox and click refresh we've got that ugly looking border disappearing okay so the one thing that we need to get done in this video is get this navigation moved over to appear next to our logo because right now you know being underneath the logo isn't really that interesting and it'll be nice if we could float all of these actual links next to each other so that it would appear home about tutorials and contact instead of them all being underneath each other okay so to do that we're going to go back to notepad Plus and I'm going to open up my header tag over here and underneath my image or actually in my image tag rather not underneath it I'm going to give this a class and I'm going to give this a class of logo then I'm also going to go to my nav tag over here and give this a class and I'm going to set this class equal to top and the school nav because this is our top nav and I'm going to leave the rest of these things but now let's see if we can actually get this nav up here next to our logo so go back over to CSS and we'll select that picture or that image with the class of logo and I'm going to give that a width of whatever our image width was so if I open up this over here there's my image and I can see that my dimensions are 232 by 100 so let's give that a height of 100 pixels and a width of 200 and 32 pixels okay and then I'm going to float this to the left and the same thing a for mine now let's go ahead and grab that class okay and top nav okay and I'm going to float this left as well but I need to figure out now how much space do I have for my navigation because we've given our website or our container a total width of 1,000 pixels now I have my logo over here taking up 232 pixels so 1000 - 232 my math probably isn't that great right now so let's Oh my calculator and let's see 1001 is 232 is equal to 768 so I'm going to go ahead and give this a width of 768 pixels and I guess some of you could probably have done that in your heads and your party shouting you the screen right now because I use the calculator but hey so now let's go ahead and actually run this in Firefox so click refresh and now we have our image flow and our actual navigation floated next to each other but we also have this header kind of wrapping around the image so we want to get a rid of that now and to do that I'm going to go over to my header over here and I'm going to actually place in an empty div so I'm just going to give this a div and I'm going to end that div off and it's going to be a empty div but I'm going to give this div a class of clear now go back to CSS and over I'm not actually sure where to put it but I'm going to put it up here maybe with the rest of the stuff kind of default stuff so actually no let's let's put it just over there just just right there hey okay so select that class off clear and we will just give this an attribute of clear:both and what that's going to do is force this header over here to stop wrapping around the floated image and actually appear where we want it to down here so look at that now we have our logo and our links appearing next to each other but our links are still one on top of the other so let's try and see if we can get them to display next to each other and there are two different ways we can do this the first way is to go over to our top nav tag over here but we're going to select it with child elements so top nav and then we want these list elements over here to actually display next to each other so we need to grab these list elements okay so let's go back to CSS over top nav ul L I and what that's going to do is grab all list items inside of a unordered list inside of the navigation and then we're going to go ahead and style those and I keep minimizing notepad plus plus when I still want to work in it so let's just indent over here and we can do this in two different ways so like I said we can float these all left so just like that float left and click refresh and as you can see it they're now all floated one next to the other right next to each other there's absolutely no space between them so if i zoom in you can see there's no space between them now the second way is actually going to leave a little bit of space between them so if I go back to notepad plus plus and instead of saying float left I say display:inline-block like this okay that's going to make them all appear one next to the other but as you can see there's a little bit of space between each link so if you guys want to do with that way you can do it that way or you can float them left and actually give them some padding and that's actually what I prefer to do so I prefer to say float lift and then I actually prefer to give them a padding so a padding of 15 pixels and 20 pixels will do and that means that there's going to be 15 pixels of padding on the top and 20 pixels of padding on the left and the right but for some reason this isn't actually going to make the links move down well it actually did but not not that much okay okay so to actually Center these things I'll get them to be pushed further down we're probably just going to have to increase the padding on the top and the bottom by a little bit so let's make that 25 rather than 15 but of course this is all you know just playing around so click refresh and it's now moved slightly further down but still not quite the center just yet so you know probably about 30 and say maybe 35 should actually do this it might even push it a little bit too far but now that's actually perfect so now we have our links actually centered with the logo but if you want them all the way down to the bottom then I guess you could just play around with the padding until you got it perfectly but I'm going to leave mine right there where they are and I'm going to end the video right here and in the next video we'll take a look at how to get our aside section appear next to the actual main content of the web page so that's what you guys have got to look forward to and I will see you guys in the next video as always don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share and I'll see you guys next time
