hi in this video of HTML we will discuss about the comments comments are basically something in a document which is completely ignored by the browser means even if you will write the comment on your HTML page either on the head on the bar on the body so it will not be reflected as the output in the browser why because comments purpose is to give the information to your colleagues for example today I as a web designer in a company is designing a web page maybe tomorrow or some after day some other day I will resign and some other employee will come and we'll work on the same web page so the comment which I will try today will help him out that why I have put some particular tag or whatever I have done I can actually keep on explaining for whatever I'm doing while designing a web page inside the comments so it will be a basically a good practice to write comments when you are working on a big documents it will in fact help you also out after a few days like today I created a very big document maybe after some time I'll forget something about it I can go there again I can read the doc read the comments and I will get my information back so let's see how to write the HTML comments now so now in context of comments as here you can see I have already created a demo page where I have put a heading that comment doesn't come in browser so let's try to add a comment right before this heading and in order to put that what I will do I will write a comment like this which will begin with the exclamation symbol inside the angular bracket and then followed by two hyphens now after that you can write whatever you want in order to pass some information about a particular segment or about your webpage which will be helpful for the new developers or new designers which will work on the very same page and after writing the text you can just close it again by a couple of - symbols followed by the closing of your angular bracket so let's save it and come to the browser where I'll refresh and see that comment doesn't come in browser but I am not able to see any comment on the top of this if I'll come and see the page source then only I will be able to see the comment but in the main output screen it is not visible so as I said in the description as well like in order to give some details some description or some crucial information about the new designers or developers who are coming to the same page to work you can use the comment to make their life and your life in future easier
