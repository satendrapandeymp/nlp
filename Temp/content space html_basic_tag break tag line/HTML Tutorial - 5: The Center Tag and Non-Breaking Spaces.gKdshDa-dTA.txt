hello guys welcome to my channel this is the fifth doodle in this course and in this tutorial we are going to talk about couple of important things so the first thing that we're gonna have a look at is the center tag and the center tag is actually deprecated and you would hear a lot of people tell you that you should not be using center tags and I would suggest the same thing that you should not use a center tag because there are other ways of doing what you would normally achieve by using center tag in HTML and you know people would suggest you to use CSS for serving your purposes but again as I said in the first hole in this course it's it's it's it's a very popular tag and you know it's one of those tags that was used a lot you know with the previous versions of HTML and I just wanted you guys to know you know what it does so that if you see it in use somewhere and it's still being supported by the way so you know you would definitely see it a lot of places and you know you should just know what it's used for so I've got this HTML file here and I'll first show you guys how it looks in Google Chrome so this is how it looks you know you've got a heading which is at the center of your web page and then you also have another sentence you know as a new paragraph in the body and then the title of the page is the center tag and non-breaking spaces right so I'll show you the HTML for the page now on line one again you have the doctype declaration and then between the HTML tags on line two and twelve you have the head sections and the body sections and the title tag you know is on line number four and the title of the page as I said is the center tag and non-breaking spaces so on line number seven you have the opening center time and it's just the word center between less than symbol greater than symbol for the opening and closing angular brackets and between the opening center tag on line seven and the closing center tag on line nine I have you know the h1 tags you know that is the opening h1 tag and the closing at one time and in between these I have some text post put this right at the center so let's say I just wanted the text to be at the center of the webpage and I didn't want it to be bold or have a greater font size then I would have not used the heading tanks but since I wanted to use you know a greater font size and also bold text I use the heading tags and I also wanted it to be at the center of the page so that's why I use it the sender tied so you know this is called comp you know combining tags or using combination of tags or cascading tags you know to create combined effects so you have the heading effect combined with the the center effect you know by using the two tags this way right and the sequence in which you close tags is the reverse of the sequence in which you open tags so here I've opened the center tag first and the h1 tag after it so I have to close the h1 tag first and the center tag after that right and then I have a paragraph on line numbered on line number ten and I have the opening P tag and the closing P tag on the same lines on the same line and I have the text but I like being on the left in between right so another thing that I want to discuss in this tutorial is let's say I have a paragraph here and you know I'll get in the closing P tag here and I put in some text written in here like this dude rocks and an exclamation symbol I'll save this file and I'll refresh it in google chrome and I see that another sentence appears here so it says this dude rocks now let's say I want you know few characters of space before the opening alphabet P of the sentence right so that is I want some space towards the left of the sentence now if you guys think that okay you know that's pretty simple all we have to do is go to the beginning of the sentence after the opening paragraph tag and you know have in as many characters of spaces as is required if you save this file and if you read on it in the browser you see that it appears the same way like nothing has changed that's because as I said hTML is white space insensitive so you know whenever you want to have spaces at places where HTML would not read the normal space characters as actual space you have to use the non-breaking space you know the feature of HTML so what you would have to do is type in the ampersand symbol and then NP SP which is a short form for non-breaking space and then a semicolon right and as soon as I put in the semicolon there you must have noticed that notepad plus plus has changed the entire thing to you know italicized version and I'll copy this and let's say you want to have 10 spaces so I'll you know just paste this nine more times so 1 2 3 4 5 and I'll you know place this 5 more times or four more times 6 7 8 9 here and then this dude rocks and I'll save this file and I'll go to Google Chrome and I'll refresh it and now I see that this sentence is shifted by 10 characters of space right so that's it for this tutorial I'll see you guys in the next video in which we will discuss more features of HTML more tags and I hope you guys are having fun in this course and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and see you in the next video till then take care
