alright guys welcome to your 30 second JavaScript tutorial in in this lesson I'm going to be showing you guys how to play and pause your movie so remember in the last tutorial what we did is we added an event listener called player pause to this play button so basically whenever the user clicks this play button right here a function called play or pause is going to fire so this isn't a function that's built in already we actually need to build this function ourselves so let's go ahead and do that right now so go ahead and add the word function and hit play or pause and this function isn't going to take any parameters it's just going to do some grunt work now the very first thing we need to do is we need to determine if the movie is playing already now if the movie is playing and they hit this button then it's going to pause the movie however if the movie hasn't even started yet or if it's paused whenever they hit this button it's going to start playing again so again the first thing we need to do is determine the status of the movie is this movie playing and we do that with a simple if statement so we say if and the very first thing we need to do is we need to reference the movie itself and we do that by referencing my movie now remember the variable my movie is a direct reference to this video right here so in order to determine if the video is playing or not we do this if my movie is paused and let me just go ahead and copy this and my movie is ended now a couple things I want to take note of this little explanation point in case you forget it means the opposite so we're pretty much saying okay if my movie or if the video right here is not paused and if the movie is not ended then it must be playing so after this if statement we want to write all the code that what do we want to happen if they clicked this button while the video was playing well if they click that button while the video was playing the first thing that we need to do is pause the movie so go ahead and hit my movie and call a function called pause and another thing I want to point here is html5 and JavaScript gives us a lot of default functions if you spell them correctly and one of those functions is pause so we don't need to program this pause function later on it already comes built-in to your browser so whenever you apply this pause function to a video it's going to go ahead and pause the video itself so the very first thing we want to do is pause the movie now what we want to do after that is we want to change the text on the button so if this movie is paused then we want to turn this into a play button however as the video is playing we want to make the text on the spun say pause because as the video is playing you can have a play button because what would do the video is already playing no need to press any buttons hoss so alright our movie is just pause we pause it in that line of code so how do we access the text on the button well we know how to access it right here but how do we get there through JavaScript well the very first thing we need to do is we need to reference the play button itself so the play button is referenced through this variable right here and the property to access is called inner HTML now whatever we set this equal to is this inner HTML property is pretty much accessing the text on the button so what do we want the text on the button to say well we want it to say play why do we want it to say play because our movie is paused already so whenever they hit this again it's going to say play and our movie is going to play you'll see later on and the last thing I'm going to do is this is kind of weird teaching you guys this because I didn't make the set interval function yet but just follow along for now you guys will understand what's going on in about like 90 seconds so window clear interval whoa take it easy caps locks interval and this takes a couple parameters actually Update bar just going to put one for now and okay like I said I'm going to tell you guys what this means because this is like part two of something and I didn't even get to part one yet so once I you know explain and that it's going to make sense so this is the code what happens whenever your movie is playing but what if your movie is paused or what if the movie had ended well then we want that code to happen in this else block right here so if the movie is paused or if the movie has ended then whenever they click that play button then the first thing we want to do is of course play the movie so instead of pausing the movie we're just going to go ahead and copy this and change it to play now play is another built-in function that came with JavaScript now whenever you use this play function on a video then the video starts playing of course now as the video is playing we don't want a play button to pop up right here because why would you need to click a play button if the video is already playing it would be much more handy if you had a pause button so you could pause that video so we're going to be doing is we're going to be updating the text on the button but changing it to pause so as the video is playing you want a pause button now this last thing I want to go ahead and talk about right now what we want to do is we're going to be having that update bar remember not this yellow bar but we have a separate blue bar that progress bar we want that to basically change the width as our video is playing so in order to change the width we need to call a function over and over again like pretty much every second because we want that bard update every second so in order to call a function every second you do something called set interval now go ahead and make a variable called update bar and set this equal to a function called set interval now set interval takes two different parameters the first parameter it takes is what function do you want to call now the next function we're going to be building and the next story is called update and this function is basically going to change the size of our progress bar and now the next parameter it takes is how often do you want to call this function in milliseconds so 500 milliseconds is every half a second 1,000 milliseconds is every one second so basically we're saying okay every half a second we want you to update the size of that progress bar on the bottom so therefore as we're watching the video we can watch it grow and grow and grow and now I can explain this little bit of code what this means right here is pretty much stopped updating the bar because when our movie is paused we don't need to change width of that bar so that's why we're saying clear the interval stop updating everything so again arm yeah I think that's pretty much it so basically player pause changes the text on the button whenever your video is playing and you hit that button it's going to pause it change the word to play and it's going to stop updating because when the video is paused you don't need to change the size of that bar however when your video is not playing it or it's paused and you hit that button right here it's going to start playing your video and it's going to change the text of this button to pause and it's also going to start changing the size of that little progress bar that little blue bar on the bottom so now that we got that button taken care of in the next story we're going to be covering this update method or the update function rather which is pretty much going to be responsible for changing the size of pixels of the width of that progress bar it's going to be amazing and again I want to stress one last time before I let you guys go if you have any trouble with this code or if you're getting any errors then I'm going to be copying all this code and posting it on my forum so you can just go ahead and copy it throw it in if you're too lazy to type it or else you know you're getting a bunch of errors just go ahead and copy it so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe we've got like two more tutorials to go until we made the best video player ever so thank you guys and I'll see you next time
