how's it going on wanna come back to our next episode on how to create HTML and CSS now in this episode somebody asked me to show you how we can create pseudo elements inside our CSS file and this is something that's really useful to know when it comes to doing any sort of CSS styling so I figure we're going to do that in this episode here now a pseudo element is a way for us to style a specific part of an element so if we were to go inside our website here and that I have in front of me you can see that we have a basic index page and inside this index page I created a bunch of examples to demonstrate what exactly a pseudo element can do to elements inside a website now dupaire Monda is quite a lot of pseudo elements you can use inside a website when it comes to styling so I'm not going to show all of them but I will show some of the more important ones that is used pretty often when he creates CSS files and you know CSS styling when it comes to students so what I have here is basically a bunch of paragraphs and I also have a couple of dip boxes with paragraphs inside of them you know to demonstrate some of these pseudo elements so we were to take a look at this inside the browser you can see that if were to refresh just to clean it up a bit we have a bunch of paragraphs a header a couple of links and that's pretty much it so what I want to do is I want to go inside my CSS file and demonstrate pseudo elements one by one so inside my CSS file I'm going to go ahead and start by showing you something called a root pseudo-element now I should mention before we get into this that there's in fact two different types of pseudo elements we can use inside CSS there's something called pseudo classes which changes the state of a specific element such as when we hover on it or if we click on it or something and we have something called pseudo elements which is actually changes part of the element where we can actually select part of the element and then do something to it so what we're going to talk about first is going to be some of these different pseudo classes now a pseudo class could be defined with a colon and then the name of whatever we want to do to this specific element so we talked about like I said in the previous episode about the one called root and root is sort of a special sort of thing when it comes to pseudo classes because root is actually when we point to a specific element inside our website which is something called the root element and the root element is the highest level element we have inside the website so if we were to go inside my index page just to demonstrate what I mean you can see that for example down here we have a tip box that has a bunch of paragraphs inside of it which means that the tip box is the highest element when it comes to this specific section here when it comes to the entire document we have something called a HTML tag which wraps everything inside the documents now you would think that the HTML tag is going to be the highest element but it's actually not going to be the root element is one element higher than the HTML elements so when we style the root element we can style anything inside the website so were to go inside my style see it again go inside the root element and say they want to change the color to something like red then we'll tint in color of any sort of text inside the entire website because we're styling the highest element so the styling here is going to apply to all the sub elements inside the root elements if that makes sense so this is what we talk about when we talk about the root elements now if I were to go ahead and just comment it out and go down to the next example here you can see that we have another pseudo class called hover now I should mention we use these pseudo classes we can just use them without having anything in front of them like I just did here which means that anything inside the website when I hover on anything then it's going to make some kind of change inside the website so for what to say when I hover all text colors should turn red they never were to go inside the website refresh if I were to take my cursor and move it inside the website you can see everything turns red inside the website because I applied to styling to everything or I applied the pseudo element the pseudo class not the element to everything inside the website so going back in here it's probably better in this specific case to say I want to for example target all the h1 tags and then apply the hover pseudo element to it meaning that right now if were to go inside the website refresh I simply created a hover effect when I hop on top header but not anything else inside this website here so this is a really used example of a pseudo element because we use hover effects constantly inside a website and it's really useful for you to remember this specific pseudo element when it comes to styling okay now we can do anything from changing color to giving you know different text sizes to to moving the text around so we can actually save margin Exynos use padding heading left is going to be 50 pixels now I did sumo bit in my browser so you can see all the text because it's bigger so it might move a bit more than what looks like 50 pixels inside the browser we can also go and change the font size if you want to so let's actually wouldn't do that as well just to give some more examples here so we change the font size to something like 30 pixels and if we were to go back and set the web side you can see that we do a couple of changes to this header when I do in fact hover on it so we can do a bunch of things now we can also add transitions to make the hover effects more smooth but that's something else for another episode so going back into our Kodi I'm just gonna go ahead and just delete these first two because they're not really that good to have when I hope inside the website they're gonna move everything around in my examples here so just gonna go ahead and so the next example which is something called active and again I'm not going to show you all examples I'm just going to show the most popular ones inside these pseudo elements here so active is something that if I were to go on a link for example inside the website I'm just gonna go and refresh go down to this link here and when I click down on my mascar so you can see that the text changes into green and that's because I set the color to green when I click the text now if we were to let go is not going to keep the color change because it's not active when I let go of the mouse cursor so it's as soon as we hold down the mouse it's going to change color now there's also pseudo classes for if we did in fact click on the link which I can actually show you here so if we were to say instead visited go back inside the website right now it should change in the green constantly because I am inside the front page right now and that's well link to inside the hyper reference who were to go back inside the code and see as you can see down here I'm linking to the front page so when i refresh it should turn green but if were to change the link into another page that I created called contacts dot HTML which I haven't visited yet I can go ahead refresh the browser you can see it turns into the regular color when I click it and then go back to the website again it turned green because I've already visited this specific link inside the website okay so going back into the stylesheet let's go and go to the next example here now we also have something called last child and in child and there's actually a bunch of different variations of this one and I just want to show two different examples of them again I will link to all different classes and elements pseudo style as we can do inside the description of this video in case you're interested in seeing much more of these different types of cool effects we can have inside a website so with the last child you can see I did actually select a class which is a dip box inside my index page and inside that class or inside the dip box I have a bunch of paragraphs now I went head and said that the last child which is a paragraph I defined here should have the color blue so if I were to save this and just to show inside the index page this is the list I'm talking about then paragraph 3 is the last child or the last paragraph child inside this tip box so it should in fact turn green what blue I think I think was blue inside the styling so who were to go inside the website you can see the DES turns green not green blue inside the dip box I talked way too much about the screen color up here so that's another example the next one is a bit more interesting because if were to go down and show you this one called enth child we do in fact have some really cool things we can do here now when it comes to end child we can do a bunch of things we can either choose just a number which means that the second child element which again is a paragraph inside my second div box that I have down here which should be paragraph number two so turn into a specific color so if we were to go ahead and just double take it should turn into a pink I did actually save it there we go it were to go inside the website refresh you can see that the second one turns pink now what we can also do is we can use even to define that all even-numbered elements which means every other even so turn pink if I were to refresh you can see that we now had to to turn pink if we were to have more paragraphs then of course more would actually turn pink and we could do the same thing when it comes to the definition called odd inside the parentheses which is switches it around now a really interesting one instead we can actually define a specific number it should skip to do specifically style do a specific styling and we can also define when it needs to start inside the list of whatever elements we have in here so a forward to go inside the parenthesis and say I want to first of all start at zero which means that we're not gonna start at the first paragraph we're going to start right before it and then I want to say that every other which is a to every other number plus zero is going to have the specific styling so we start at zero and I know it's sort of backwards but that's how I like to think of it we start at zero which is right before the first paragraph and then each other or each second paragraph is going to be styled so we'll go back inside the website it should look the same which it does so we're to go and change this and say every third there we go so now it's just every third and because I only have four paragraphs it's just going to be one style and we can also go ahead and say we want to do every second but I want to start at the first paragraph so it's going to start at the first paragraph and style that one and then go to more down and then start the next one so this is a really cool one because it really saves you a lot of time when it comes to you know styling a specific number inside a website now these are couple examples of pseudo classes let's talk about some pseudo elements now like I said pseudo classes is something that changes two states of a specific element but the pseudo elements can actually change part of the element itself so going into the pseudo elements down here I want to show you the first one here which is something called the first line pseudo elements now when we create a pseudo element compared to a class we use two colons inside right before we define the pseudo elements and this is something that's relatively new to CSS 3 because in the past it used to be just the same for all them even those classes or elements but after css3 we started using 1 & 2 for class and elements in order to tell the difference between them now if I were to go in here and try this one out this says that we have an element called element as one as a class which is this line down here I went ahead and said that we want to do something to the first line inside this paragraph so if we have many different lines inside the paragraph which I don't have but if you were to have then the first line is going to have a specific styling so right now I said we wanted a background color set to yellow and a color of the text set to red so we're to go in here refresh you can see that we now have this styling going on inside this first line inside this paragraph here so if we were to go down so the next example here it's going to uncomment everything else out and we can also do to the first letter of this specific element now when I talk about these pseudo elements I think I'm talking about all the ones there are so when it comes to pseudo classes we have a bunch of them and I just chose some examples but I think I will be talking about all the different pseudo elements in this episode here just FYI so we have the one call first letter if we were to save it go inside the website you can see it the first letter and here gets changed and just the first letter not the entire paragraph we can also if you want to if it were to say elements one for this one so that both these two types of stylings for the first line and first letter is going to be be applied to this be applied to the same paragraph then if we were to go inside the website refresh you can see that we can in fact add both of them to the same paragraph if you wanted to now the next example here is something called a selection a selection is when we do actually go in and lect by highlighting a part of a piece of text so for words to say we want to have a background color to green and a color to blue then if I were to go inside and refresh you can see when I start highlighting part of the paragraph it turns into that specific styling and it's not going to do it for the other ones because it didn't actually apply this to those paragraphs just the third one here so this is something we can also do now the last one here's something that is very used inside websites and if you were to go to any sort of popular website out there you could actually see by going inside giving the code that a lot of websites uses this before and after pseudo-element so if were to go inside my styling here I'm just going to show you for the before because before and after are going to be identical when it comes to the styling so I can just show you for one of them and then you can just use it for the other one as well now when it comes to these before and after we can go ahead and insert content before or after a specific elements and it doesn't have to be text because I've just shown you a bunch of text examples inside this website with no box as anything but discounts for anything inside the website there might be an elements so we could insert for example text or images or links or anything before and after a specific element whether being a section or just a paragraph so what I can do here is I can say well I want to insert something before element number four and the first thing I want to show here is going to be just regular plain text so if were to go in here can say we have something called content and this is something that again has a lot of different types of stylings you can apply using this content styling I'm not going to show you all the examples because there's quite a lot of them I will link to a place where you can see the different examples so look for that in the description of this video as well if you want to see more of them I'm gonna go to the server that we can insert text so we can say double quotes and then say this is a paragraph - and then if we were to save it go inside my website you can see that the bottom line down here is going to have just gonna zoom in a bit it's going to have some text inserted right in front of it so we can actually insert text in front of our content here now if we were to go in here and say I don't want to insert content I might want to insert something like a attribute or a link or something what I can do and I'm just going to go back inside the index page to show you I have a couple of different attributes and remember attributes are things like the class definition here the hyper reference definition if I were to have an ID set to something that would be a attribute as well I can actually go ahead and take the value of one of these attributes and insert as text inside what we have in here so what I could do is I could say well we do have an attribute so we can say attr parentheses and then write the name of the attribute so we could say we have maybe the hyper reference and then I can go inside the website here refresh and as you can see I went ahead and inserted the link for this specific link that I had down here and again I'm just going to point out I didn't use the paragraph for the last example I used a link which is why we have a hyper reference so what we could do here just to make a little bit prettier so I could say space - space then go back in here refresh and now we can actually see something looks a bit nicer this works for any sort of attribute so we could go back inside the styling and say well maybe the class refresh and there we have the class name instead so we can do this for all sorts of attributes I do think that we could just go inside the index page I haven't tested this yet but I'm pretty sure you can do it if one were to make up just Daniel as an attribute say double quotes and say my name then we could potentially go inside our CSS file and say Daniel save it refresh the browser and as you can see we get my name inside the text here now the reason I wanted to show you that we can just create any sort attribute is because we can do that inside JavaScript and when it comes to see it says I was pretty sure we could do it using our own made attributes inside our HTML as well so you can't just make up an attribute and then write some content and then do that with that as well just FYI if you're interested so the last example I just want to show is that we can also do this using images so we can say URL and then I could link to a potential image now I don't actually have an image inside my root folder of this website so we could but sort of pretend that I have an image so I could say I have an image folder inside the image folder I have a image dot PNG and then we'll actually insert this image before the content right before the text inside this website here so instead of my name down here and again like I said this is going to work with the after example as well so if we were to go back in here just go back a couple of steps and then say instead of two four I can say after and then come back inside the website it's going to insert it after the content here so this is how we can use pseudo elements and like I said all of these I will link in the description if you want to see more of them because it's just not going to be a very short episode if I were to show you all of them in this episode here so I hope you enjoyed I'll see you next time
