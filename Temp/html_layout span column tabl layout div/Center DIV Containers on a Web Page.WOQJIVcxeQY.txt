hey this is Ralph and in this video I wanted to go over centering dibs or really any block matter a block element for that matter so I've got a blank web page here set up called Center dibs type for html5 head section got some internal style set up I haven't created it yet so let's just do a couple things I'm going to go ahead and create a div here I'm going to call it id equals container and let me just kind of scroll up here so you can see that so I've got an opening div right after my opening body tag and I'll put a closing div right there before my closing body tag and this is a pretty normal thing to do and basically the entire webpage is contained within this container and just so we have something else to look at I'm going to go and put a headline one on here and I'll just call it headline one and just so we can check this out I'm going to put div within my div so this will be div and I'll call it id equals content there we go and so we know what that is I'll just put the word content in there so I've got a div container within that container I've got a headline one and then I get another div so I'm div within a div headline one within a div go ahead and save this and we launch this in Firefox and here's how my page looks so it's not very clear on what's going on so I'm going to go a step further here I'm going to go up to my CSS and I want to format these to some degree so I'm gonna go to my Styles here div ID container okay so this is the selector for the can for the div element with ID container and I'm going to put a background color of red I'm going to take my h1 now I'll do a background color of blue and I'm going to take my other div this will be ID equals content and I'll do a background color of green here we go now let's see what we have okay so we're seeing very natural behaviors of block elements all block elements whether it's paragraph headline one unordered list or div will try to take up the full width available to them so a block element like a div will be as wide as it can be until you tell it not to be that wide now to make it even clearer I'm going to jump back over to my CSS and I'm going to put a little bit of padding on my container okay padding of 20 pixels now it's going to be clear that my headline 1 and my content are with inside of this container div so now comes the big question is how do you Center these kinds of elements well with something like like a headline one you might say well no problem I'll just go to headline 1 text-align:center but this is misleading let's check this out it does Center the text and that's really probably what you wanted but notice my headline one has a blue background it's as wide as it can be my blue headline one my headline one is not really centered the text within my headline one is centered and that's probably fine and that's what you wanted but knowing that how do you Center or something like this content because let's say I want this content to be centered so I could do text align Center doesn't Center the div content it centers the text within there okay text align Center about what if it was a little bit narrower let me change its width over to something like 60% there we go so now my content div is 60% wide of its container so 60% of its parent container so it's 60% the width of my red container div but now we can clearly see that this is not centered so here's the trick if you want to Center a div margin okay now there's a couple ways you could write this but one of the most common ways is to use two units of measurement here the first number is going to be the top and the bottom so I could do something like let's say 0px for the top and the bottom automatch automatic margins are Auto for the left on the right top bottom left right and now when i refresh this this div is centered in the page now if instead of zero pixels I had something like 50 pixels now I have 50 pixels of margin on the top and the bottom automatic margins on the left and the right I'll knock that back down to zero though so that's how we Center a div and this is how you can also make a fixed width container so if you can see on my browser here as I resize my browser window my red container div expands and contracts and of course my green content div expands and contracts too because it's got a percentage width so if I want to do a fixed width container I would go to something like my container and I would do a width let's say I'll do 800 pixels okay just by doing 800 pixels that doesn't Center it then I would go a second step and I do margin:0px for the top and bottom auto on the left and right by the way if you look at a bunch of places if you do zero you might not even see the unit of measurement sometimes they just write it like that but I like writing in the px so here we go so now that content is it now check this out when I resize notice that my red doesn't expand and contract because I've set it to be 800 pixels wide this is now what we call a fixed width layout as opposed to a flexible layout so I do get to a point to where if my page goes narrower then I get a horizontal scroll and you want to avoid that when all possible so that's how you Center a div in the secret to that is simply give it automatic margins on the left and the right
