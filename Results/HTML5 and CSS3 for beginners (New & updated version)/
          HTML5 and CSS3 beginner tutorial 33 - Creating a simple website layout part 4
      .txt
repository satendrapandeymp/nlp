hey YouTube how's it going is Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 33 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at our content or our website layout again and yeah basically we've got everything set up so we've got our header bar in here we've got our sidebar we've got our content and our footer but there are probably going to be a few questions that people have that I just want to answer so the first question that I know I'm probably going to get is about this clear fix so if I jump over to my CSS file this clear fix that I have here I have explained the whole difference between floating and clearing and all of that and we do know the difference between displaying block and inline elements but something I just want to show you guys is if you add content in here instead of a space so let's type the word hello save this and come back over to the browser you can see that now at the bottom of this div we have a word hello appear appearing and if I inspect this element basically what happened as birds are so loud you know so what happened here was our container because we had these two divs here this one and this one that I floated to the left into the right we needed to clear the content to get our footer down to the bottom of the page and one way to go about doing that is some people will go to the HTML and actually add like a physical HTML element down at the bottom here maybe is to do sometimes it's just a paragraph or something and they'll add a class of clear or something and what that will do is actually have a style rule of clear:both and generally throwing in an extra element like that will clear any floated elements like the sidebar and the content but doing that means you actually have to have physical HTML in your content or somewhere on the page clearing content and it's just unnecessary so instead of adding extra HTML that doesn't need to be there you could just add this class of clearfix to the parents of something that you know is going to have floated elements so we know that this container is going to house contents to the left and a sidebar to the right so it's going to have floated elements in it so we'll put a class of clear fix on it and we'll add basically these four lines to the clear fix class which will then clear the content now the only reason why we have a content of a space instead of a content of like the word hello that should be fairly obvious P if we save this and we come back now it doesn't show up as a space it doesn't add any extra height or anything like that it's just it's just there you can't even see it right so it's just a really nice trick to have it comes in handy quite a lot and yeah you're probably going to use it in future so I just thought I'd show you guys that all right the next question that people I've already going to have is getting fugitives to appear next to each other because this can sometimes be tricky so right now we have our content and we've got our sidebar but if one of these containers gets too big to fit the space that it's in then generally it it falls down and it appears right down here at the bottom of the content so let's just say for example I go back over to my content yeah and we've got the content set to 70% and I've got my sidebar set to a max width of 25% I know that 70 plus 25 is 95 so technically these two elements should always appear next to each other because they're not taking up more than a hundred percent of their parent right and we can make it so that they take up exactly one hundred percent so we have max width of 70% on my content we have our max width of 30% on the sidebar now and then come back yet and refresh and now they're taking up exactly 100% of their parents so there's this one and right next to that we have our sidebar and there's no space in between them because there's not enough percentage space left for them to have space between them right we're taking up 100% of the width of the parent right but let's just say for instance our math is a little bit off let's say the width of our sidebar is now 31 percent and 31 plus 70% is obviously 101 percent from now a sidebar and our content are pretty much going to be too big to fit next to each other and so when i refresh this you can see that our sidebar has disappeared it's gone and if I scroll down on the page it's actually down here so the reason why that happened is because now the sidebar is too big to fit next to the actual content right so that's why I just kind of chose the shortcut of making this 25 percent and this 70 percent and that way they're pretty much always smaller than their parent was the max width of the parent and they'll always fit next to each other you could also use fixed values for this instead of percentages so let me just inspect elements over here right and I can see that this is my container and that has a max width of 1200 pixels so that means no matter what this is always going to be 1200 pixels well sometimes a little bit less depending on if the browser I got smaller but at its biggest it's always going to be 1200 pixels so that means I know I can ship this content to a value and right now that value is 840 pixels because that's what the 70% essentially works out to but I could set a value of something like 800 pixels and then we know that content is going to be 800 pixels therefore our sidebar we still have 400 pixels to work with because we're working with the size of the parent 1200 - 800 is 400 so we can set the sidebar to 400 pixels save that and come back here and now again you can see essentially what's happened years we've taken up 100% of the parent so they're sitting right next to each other and you could maybe make this one just a little bit smaller so you could say I want that to be 380 by the way I probably don't need both of these values I could probably just use width instead of max width for our sidebar and then we'll have the space of 20 pixels here all right so the reason for that is because I left 20 pixels of space 1200 - 800 - 380 means that we have got 20 pixels left over for there to be a little bit of space between these two elements right and the reason why I'm telling you guys all of this is because you might add extra width to these two elements that you didn't know will add or contribute to the overall width of an element so right now we are only using with if I inspect one of these elements there's no padding there's no margin there's no border or anything like that and the same on that side but let's just say for instance our content had a margin to the right of 20 pixels so it's just saying margin right of 20 pixels right so now okay this should technically still fit because I left 20 pixels of space over here but let's just let's go back to making this take 100% of its parent so the sidebar going to take up 30% the content is going to take up 70% of its parent right to come back down refresh boom sidebar gone why because together this element and this elements are taking one up 100% of the space but actually the section the content over here is taking up a little bit more space than it should because of the margin you can see this yellow line over here that's taking up a little bit extra space so technically our overall width of our content is 840 pixels plus whatever margin is on the right plus whatever margins on the left and I confuse those two around it's left and right okay whatever board is on the left whatever borders on the right whatever padding's on the left whatever padding's on the right you've got to take all of that into account as the total width of your element and if you have borders and margins and stuff like that you need to take that into account so now I know that actually and need to somehow minus 20 pixels either from the content or from my sidebar to get them to fit next to each other again so what I like to do is because I know that they're going to be a margin right of 20 pixels here I can use something called a CSS calculation which is sort of new to css3 and I can type the word calc followed by some brackets and that's going to make a calculation in CSS and then I know that I want my sidebar to be 30% but I know that I've got to count for 20 pixels of space somewhere along the line so let's - 20 pixels I mean you can put a bunch of different sums in here a lot of equations that you could use this is just kind of a simple example so 30% - 20 pixels and yeah it doesn't matter if the values are different like if you have my nursing a pixel percentage from pixels from a percentage percentage from pixels CSS kind of knows what it's going to be working with and it always comes right in the end and if we come back now and hit refresh you can see that what you did I add that to the sidebar okay so that is that unfortunately I made this mistakes like you guys can also see but yeah this calculation is very much space sensitive so if you don't have spaces over here you see that little minus symbol didn't turn orange for me and sublime if you're using a different text editor it's probably going to be different but yeah in this case because there was no spacing or the spacing was incorrect the CSS rule didn't work so let's come back here now and hit refresh okay and now the CSS has worked so these two are appearing next to each other and we do have 20 pixels of space essentially in between the two tips so yeah just take into account that whenever you are floating in floating stuff next to each other you need to take the entire width into account so it's not just the width of the element it's actually the width of the margins on both sides the borders on both sides the padding's on both sides and the actual width and yeah that's all I have for you guys in this video so go and practice floating divs next to each other try get two or three next to each other I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this
