alright guys welcome to the last tutorial in this mini series where I'm going to be teaching you guys how to finish up wrap up the code we've got one more function to take care of so let's go ahead and do that so let's actually go ahead and recap one last time all of our functions and by all of them I just mean three of them so this first function is going to get called whenever the website loads it's pretty much going to make all of our variables now the second function is pretty much what's going to get called whenever we click that play button is either going to play the video or pause the video well it depends on the video if it's playing or paused already and this last function right here update is basically going to change the size of that progress bar as the video is playing so now the only thing we have left to do is since we have the button in the progress bar taken care of is we need to change where the video is playing from depending on if they click anywhere in this progress bar for example if the video is playing in it's almost complete right here and they click right here then we want the video to start playing from around 25% if they click right here we want the video start playing around 50% so that's what we're going to be doing and we're going to be adding a method called clicked bar now remember that's the event listener that we put on the default bar so let's go ahead and copy this so we don't you know accidentally type something wrong and we'll make that function right now so function click the bar it actually takes a parameter called e now e is going to be the position of the mouse because we need to determine where our mouse is in terms of you know is it at 25% is it at 50% so we need to go ahead and pass that parameter in through right there now the very first thing I want to do is I want to check if the movie is playing because I only want this action to occur when the movie is playing so I'm just going to go ahead and add if statement and I'm going to go ahead and steal some of this code from right here if my movie is not paused and if it has not ended then go ahead and copy that and paste that right there so pretty much this is only going to work while the video is playing so now what I want to do is I want to get the expose addition of the mouse because we don't need to determine if it's up here or down here we just need to determine left and right because is the mouse at top or bottom top or bottom it doesn't matter we just need to know if it's at the beginning or the end and remember for math class X is left and right and Y is up and down so the x position is the only position we care about so make a variable and just call it something like mouse X and set this equal to remember the e what we're going to be passing in is the position of the mouse space I'll just type this guy type this and then talk you guys through e page X minus bar and might as well offset left so okay I don't want to talk to you guys about offset pretty much the offset left is how far away from the left is concerning in reference to this element and remember this bar right here is the default bar is the yellow bar basically before I don't want to talk to you guys about all this stuff because you guy should know from my JavaScript tutorials but what this does right here is it calculates the x position of the mouse and it stores it in a variable called mouse X so now what we can do is we need to pretty much change the position of the mouse and convert it to the starting time where the video is playing so let's go ahead and make a new variable and I'll call it new time and what we need to do is we need to get that x position of the mouse again so just go ahead and hit mouse X and what that's going to do is this is pretty much where it calculated that our mouse is so now what we want to do is we want to multiply this by my movie duration and I don't there we go I know I had it somewhere way too lazy to type anything twice in a row so what we're going to be doing is we're going to figure out where they click the mouse and we're going to multiply the x the duration of your entire movie and if you take this entire value in put it over 600 or the entire size of your bar which mine is 600 as you can see right here but depending on your video player may be a little different you can even put 600 like that but who wants to do that what it's going to do is it's going to give you a new starting time so don't really worry about this formula just go ahead and copy it what you need to worry about is this new time right here is it's pretty much going to take where you clicked on the mouse and convert it into a new starting time for that video so now you want to say okay instead of starting from the beginning just start playing this video wherever I clicked so if I click here it's going to play you know one minute and if I click here it's going to play three minutes in however what we need to do is we need to we calculated all those figures already but now we need to say okay actually start playing at this point in time so in order to do that go ahead and reference my movie which is the video itself and there's a property called current time and this is pretty much where your movie is playing at that moment and it's going to go ahead and change every second as your movie plays but what we want to do is we want to set this equal to the variable new time so there is a time stored in this variable right here and depending on which value is where our movie is going to start playing pretty much just go ahead and copy all this code and don't even worry about me talking but if you want to know you know the inner workings of the video player then that's all that so pretty much wherever you click that's where your video is going to start playing now aside from them this is going to take care of the video playing however we need to take care of one other tiny little detail detail and that's we need to change the width of the progress bar depending on where they clicked so if they clicked right here we only want a blue bar to go from here to here if they clicked right here then we want two blue bar to go from here to here so in order to do that again we need to change the style or the width of the progress bar so let's just go ahead and copy that code and instead of size equals plus pixels what we need to do is hit Mouse X and then we go ahead and we add the word pixels on oh if that's social we're just the px so pretty much this is going to get a value from some R 0 to 600 if it's in the middle let's say we click 300 then it's going to set the width of the progress bar to 300 pixels so maybe with this line of code you can understand all this right here it's like once you understand one little thing then the rest of everything makes sense like backwards inception so now we got that clicked bar method taken care of which pretty much says okay depending on where they click play the video starting at that point in time so what we need to do is we need to add oh excuse me I just hit the microphone with my hand we need to add one more line of code and that's for this this do first function we want that to be the first function that gets called whenever we start our website or excuse me whenever our website fully loads but we don't have any function to call this function so what we need to do is we're just going to add that window window add actually I'm going to just go ahead and copy this because I'm Way too lazy add event listener just like this and this is pretty much going to get called as soon as our window loads why do I say that because the first parameter I'm going to type into here is load what function do I want to call as soon as our window loads well I want to call this new first function just lack of this right here and remember like I said the last parameter is always false unless I tell you guys otherwise so let me go ahead and save this and refresh this and see if we got working video player so first let's go ahead and test our let's see what function do we have first our player pause so whenever we hit this our video should start playing our progress bar should change sizes and as you can see this play button changed to pause so let me go ahead and scroll in a little bit now watch what happens when I hit pause it changes to play because now our video is paused and now we can hit play to start playing the video in and now the video is playing I'm going to go ahead and hit pause it changes to play and as you can see our progress bar is updating every half of a second now the other thing I want to test out is as this video is playing we can go ahead and click on this default bar and our progress bar to change first of all we'll hop to that current time and change the progress bars with so if I want to click 25% into the movie it's going to start playing 25% at this point in time and our progress bar is going to change with if I want to click send a or 5% it's going to end yada-yada-yada you see how it goes so basically all of our functions are working beautifully as soon as our website loads it calls this new first function which pretty much makes all our variables and then our player pause is what's going to be sitting on this button and well that's pretty much it I'm getting tired of talking and someone spent 10 minutes so again I want stress one last time all of this code is available for free on my website go there thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next door
