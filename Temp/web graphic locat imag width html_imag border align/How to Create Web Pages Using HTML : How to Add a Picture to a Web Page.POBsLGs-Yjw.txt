hello my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a software developer in this video I will show you how to add a picture to a web page to do this inside the body tag you add a new image tag type IMG short for image and then SRC short for source and then type inside quotation marks the location of this image in this case I have a car image in the same folder as my HTML file so type car dot jpg save the file and reload the browser if you want to make your image appear smaller or bigger on your page you can do that by using the width and height attributes of the image tag type width equals 300 and height equals 200 this tells the browser to display the image at a resolution of 300 pixels by 200 pixels save the file and refresh now you see the new image on the page a lot of people use higher resolution images and by that I mean images that are larger and then simply adjust the necessary width and height attribute accordingly for example on the same folder I have a picture called my car with a resolution of 3072 with by 2300 and for height I will include it instead of the cars image you will see that the image is displayed but it gets a little distorted and most importantly even when this picture is displayed at a smaller percentage of its actual size the image still needs to be loaded completely so if you have a 2 megabyte picture displayed at a smaller size it would be an image that would take a lot of time to load on the page instead use an image editor to resize the image you will see that the new image file size will be only a small fraction of its original and this would make your pages faster to load you I'm Luis Estrada and I've just shown you how to create web pages using HTML
