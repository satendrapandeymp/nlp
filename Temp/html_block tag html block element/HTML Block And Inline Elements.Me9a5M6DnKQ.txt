hello guys and welcome to Martin sex and today I am going to explain you the difference and show you the difference between HTML block and inline element so first thing is what is block ilim HTML block level element and what is inline element so inline element pretty much ease element if you add it to your HTML as you see we add the rolling as link is inline element and heading back is not England element then if you are not adding any style to your element it takes all these of that line and pretty much next block level element will be pushed this one says block level element it pushes next element whenever you add to the next line so let's have a look in our code what is happening here Oh almost all elements in HTML our block level element there are only two elements or maybe more but to which you will be working with and I will show you the how you can make a recognizes it the block level element oritse in one element block little elements whenever you add a block level element for example HTML we shall hear links tutorial okay let's create one more tag of that control Z and here we will say html5 block block element okay and now you might seem the research team l5 block element will go next to these texts but if we save this now for example you save it now we see that this block level element it pushed this next block level element to the next line it is not as the same line so it doesn't allow these texts or this next h1 tag which we created to stand next straight to it and you might ask why is this way I added this particular kidding and it pushed max heading down so how I can add more text here if I want so for that we will use C assessment we will start working with we assess we will say that these block level element only is as wide as the text and we don't want it to take all horizontal row across the screen and here this is as well block level element and B does exactly the same when you add a block level element you don't add any kind if you don't add any styling to that particular block element we CSS like I said which we will look in next video the block level element always takes all horizontal line but there are also inline elements like I mentioned one of the inline elements which you can recognize of how you can recognize England element is that they will if you will add one inline elements and you will add next in line element it will make not take all horizontal line it will stand next week for example we have here this willing click here and if we will add now one more link for example with that console be we have click here to for example and let's say this 10 let's go back let's refresh you see that this next link it went straight after this first link click here and then we have this click here link to so this is pretty much the different the block level element when you add in HTML it is structured beans away that it will take all wind all your window straight away all these of your window and we'll push next element to the next line but when we you are styling for example your element with CSS you can use particular reach to your local level element so next block level element can be laid out next to this particular block level element but in general this is what a in HTML block level elements me so this will just take whole life if you would for example it some CSS and they will show you CSS style attribute and I will show you the difference let's style this let's add a background of this block level element heading tag for example let's add it right and to do this we use style tag don't worry about CSS now if you are not if you don't know how it works but you know that here we are using style attribute as we talked already about attributes and fins and we have equal size and then we have these diamond pieces and in between we add values for the style attribute so let's see if we won't background rate so fast can we use coal and set it and we use this semicolon this is simple style attribute and business from CSS how you add background this is background and we gave it a read so let's say it little backdoor page oh it's refreshing and now you see the background of that particular element and now you see that block level element is taking all horizontal weeks but now let's add background pulling back and let's see what it does so let's take the same style attribute all is just copied okay and let's drop it in somewhere it doesn't really matter in a link tag info from tagged as you remember all attributes in HTML are added in front opening tag of any HTML element so but we will not say that but we will make it green let's say please okay like round green so let's save it let's go back over to the treasure and now we see that link tag is not taking a horizontal space it takes only as much space as its uses or as its value is using which is here in between riesling opening tag and willing closing tag or here in this case as you see because that the next 12 makes link tag the same like this please attribute let's do it like copy that fearsome jovi and then we let's look at but let's add orange for example visa HTML safe colors so you can use names for them but in most cases in when we are right with CSS save colors so in most cases when we will be using colors or CSS we will not be adding style in our HTML and when we start learning CSS I will explain you why but generally it's because of caching poor posture your page float slower if you have style in line styling people like we are adding here so this is very bad practice normally we don't do this so let's save it a depression you see that second link is as well orange in our case so this is in line element so here to understand how block level element from in HTML even if you don't know elements at the moment you don't need to remember them when you will be adding HTML elements and the 50 states talks next to it this means that this is in line element if it pushes next element to next one then this means that that's a block level element because block level elements is if you don't add in styling it takes all bits of your screen for example like I mentioned before level as you show you a little bit more of CSS for now so you know how you can style your block level element so you don't see that always if you have other title here then nothing else can be added right to it so to the right of it so there can be added so let's add a bit of fifty percent of the screen so or fifty percent of the screen would be calm as you know all width of the screen is conscious person so let's go back and let's again continue writing our CSS in how style attribute analyst AV fifty percent ok and let's float this element close column right ok now we floated it right we'll save it let's go back refresh and now oh sorry we floated it right I wanted to float it left action blessed blessed so it's on the left hand side so let's save it let's refresh it and now you see there's now this block level element because we added float it floated and it floated all other elements to the right of it but it don't worry now about CSS because i'm not talking about theses i'm just showing you that we we can change reads and hate of particular elements so if we add one block element we can always manage with CSS when we will come to CSS styling how its laid out but only thing about block level elements to understand in HTML is that if you are not adding any styling to this particular block level element it will take all these of the screen if and inline elements are different that if you are adding inline elements they will stock make one next to another one like we see here weaseling tags okay guys this is pretty much it for this video and see you next video
