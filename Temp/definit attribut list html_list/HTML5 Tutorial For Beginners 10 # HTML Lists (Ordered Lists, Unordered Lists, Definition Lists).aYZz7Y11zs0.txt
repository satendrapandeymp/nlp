hello guys welcome to the next video on HTML tutorial for beginners using html5 in this video we will see how to use lists in HTML so there are two types of Lists you can use in HTML first is unordered list which is something like this which has no order and second is ordered list which has some kind of ordering it may be numbered ordering or it may be alphabetical ordering or it may be any other kind of ordering so let's see how we can use these type of lists in HTML so first of all we will see how we can create unordered lists okay so to make an unordered list you need the tag called ul which stands for unordered list and inside this tag you need to have list items so just give Li and it will add a list item and inside this list item you can add your name of your list or description of the list okay so I will add two more items like this and then for example I want to have a list of names ok so then what I can do I can just give the name for example something like this okay I will save my code and refresh my webpage it looked like this so this is an unordered list okay now unordered list also can be of different types so you can add attribute called style here and then inside the style attribute value you can add this line so just add a list - style - type and by default the type is disk or description which is like this by default when you save it it'll look like this so it's the default type right but when you change this disk for example - circle like this and save it and refresh your page then you can see you have small bullets in front of your list items right or you can have a square here so Square and save it and refresh your web page and your bullet becomes squared okay or you can have one more option here which is none okay and when you give this option and when you refresh your webpage there is no bullet in front of your list items right so for unordered list you have these items now to create an ordered list first of all I will remove this style attribute from here and to create an ordered list instead of ul you just need to replace it with Oh L which stands for ordered list okay and the default sheet type is numbered type so it will look something like this so one two three four right but this can also change so when you add our attribute called type here and for example by default it's numbered so you can write one here and it becomes numbered list so it's like the same okay and when you replace number one by capital a let's see what happens so I will save it and refresh my web web page and now you can see my list is ordered by capital letters okay for example we want to order our list with small letter you just need to replace this capital a by small a and refresh your web page it will look like this okay or for example you need a Roman numbered ordered list then you just need to write capital I and save it and refresh your web page it becomes Roman letter in capital Roman letter you can say write and same you want in small Roman letters then you just need to write I here and save it and refresh your page and your list becomes small Roman letter ordered list okay now you can also create a nested list so to create a nested list for example my list is ordered list right now and for example I want to list out for each name some favorites for example right so I can go just below my list item where I want to create a list once again and for example I want this time unordered list so I can just write unordered list like this and in here once again I can add list items right for example John likes T and John likes coffee and save it and refresh it and you see it becomes list inside a list so nested list okay so you can also have nested lists like this now you also have one more type of list which is called description list okay and as the name suggests it starts with DL so just write DL and becomes description list and inside this description list you can have description terms or DT which sent for description terms and here you can have some terms so for example term right and then you have a tag called DD which is called description detail and here you can add the detail of this term right so description of the term something like this okay and you can add multiple terms and descriptions and save it and refresh your web page and your term and description of the term looks like this okay so in this way you can use lists in HTML I hope you have enjoyed this video please rate comment and subscribe and bye
