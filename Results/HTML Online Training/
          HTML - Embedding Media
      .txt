hi as of now we have done a lot of things in our HTML document in this video we'll see if I want to play a video or an audio file in my HTML file how can we do that so here we'll actually going to use the embedding tab in order to embed any media object in your HTML page so in this particular example I am going to play a video for you which will be using an embed tag in my HTML and the output will be the video in your browser running make sure that you have some plugins basic plugins or for the media files installed in your browser otherwise your browser will not support any of the media element so let's see how to start embedding the media objects in your HTML so as discussed if I want to use some media element in our web page I'm going to use the embed tag out here so here in embertec what I'll have to do is is the SRC means where the video or any media file is located so here it's a media element it means there's a folder called media inside which the media element means this video called video dot mp4 is located and this directory media is at the same location where I have saved my HTML file now here I am giving the relative path for accessing this video it is as same as we did it for the images now once the player for this media will be added in your browser you will mention the height and width of that particular browser in case you browser doesn't have a plug-in to play that particular kind of video if we can use the new embed tag right inside this embed so in case this media element will not be supported by the browser I will get this message in other hand you can also put an image or any gif which may replace that video or that may tell about the unavailability of video for reason so whatever you want to put when the video is unplayable over your browser you can put the thing inside this no embed tag so let's come back to the browser and refresh it and see how this particular page is looking like so as here you can see this is one of the video of tutorials point of JavaScript which I have located in that particular location and now as soon as i refresh this page it is started so in the very same way you can just put the different kind of files like it is and before you can put all those file extensions available here which can be supported by the browser so this is how you can start accessing the video elements or any media elements through HTML though in real time web development we do have some more tools and better tools like in html5 we have at some other way to include the video or but whichever technology will be working one they may provide you some of the different controls which will give you some more advanced features of any media element or any video player so this is all about how you can access the video through HTML
