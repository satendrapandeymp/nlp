okay I've got one more length that I want to show you and that's the mail to link now I take a little liberty with my Bill of Rights page and I've gone ahead and added a mail to link at the very bottom you see where it says please email me for your input that's a mail to link now if I didn't have the word email here you wouldn't be able to distinguish it from any other link so I'm going to click on it when I do that it brings up my default email software however your computer is configured that's what it will bring up now notice that it's already addressed to me and that it has a subject of Bill of Rights I don't really want to send that to myself that'd be kind of silly so I'm just going to quit and let's quit Safari let me show you the code that I use to generate this now went down to the bottom of our HTML for the Bill of Rights page and I add it in this section of code right here the first line is simply a comment it's documenting what I'm doing when I came in I wanted to have a little white space between the last line and my email link or my mail to link so I put in a couple of breaks that I wanted my link to be a little bit bigger and centered on the page the way I accomplished that was to use the style attribute and applied it to the pair ten so everything in this paragraph I set to be 20 pixels high five size 20 pixels and text-align:center the next two lines are my mail to link over the beginning of my mail to links where I started up the first line is just like any other anchor tag it begins with a we then have href equals quote male 2 : that tells your browser to expect an email address and I put in my email address mark that Winokur at matcom the question mark is not part of my email address it's there to tell the browser that there's more to follow so we'll take a look at the second one the rest of it that follows is the at subject my subject heading for my email follows that subject equals and it's gonna look a little funny to you but that says Bill of Rights now you might be saying hey Mark what are you drinking in your coffee that says bill percentage sign 20 of percentage sign 20 rights well that's how I typed it in but percent 20 is interpreted as a blank space so I get bill space of space right and then I am my 10 notice also that the quotes are before male 2 and all the way at the end of my subject so that's my start tag I then put in the text that I want to anchor this tad to please email me your input the next one simply ends the tag and then I end the paragraph that's all of the new code that I added to get this mail too late give it a try I think you'll have some fun
