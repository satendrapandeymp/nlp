hello friends welcome to CSS video tutorial series in this video tutorial I would like to discuss CSS font family property vs. HTML face attribute CSS font family property and HTML face attribute are used to specify the font to be applied to the content of HTML element various values that we can assign to font family property are we can assign specific font name you can see here we have list of font names Cambria is one of the font Calabria is one of the font a table Arabic is one of the font all these are examples of font names we can assign any one of them to the font family property while assigning the font family property we have to check whether the font contains more than one words if there are more than one words then we have to enclose that font in single quotations if there is only one word then we can skip the single quotes also we can assign specific font family name for example Arial is a font family within the Arial you get various fonts like Arial black Arial narrow etc let me give you some more example for font family names for example here I type Arial if I go to Arial you can see Ariel is actually a font family within that we get various fonts like Arial black Arial narrow Arial rounded empty bold these are all fonts within the Arial family similarly I can say here century if you see the century you can observe century is the font family name within that you get century gothic is one of the font century school book is one of the font face I hope you guys are understanding the difference between a font face and the font family within the font family you get various fonts friends we can also assign generic font family name there are mainly to generic font families one is serif font family another one is sans serif font family to the font family property we can assign more than one fonts by using the comma operator what browser actually does means it applies the first font if it is available in the system if the first font is not available then it goes to the second font name then it goes to the third font name like that that is how it drilldowns while applying the font to the HTML content here in the notepad I have given a little bit introduction on fonts especially on serif fonts and sans-serif fonts serif font family has various fonts you can see Times New Roman century Bookman old style Georgia these are all examples for serif fonts the special feature of a serif fonts is the serif font characters stroke end you find extra decoration you can see here extra arms and base at the stroke end of a character whereas if you go to sailing serif sans serif fonts you don't find any extra decoration at the stroke end of a character Arial Verdana Tahoma Calibri these are all example for sans serif fonts sans means without serif means decoration sans serif means without decoration you can see that I hope you guys have understood the difference between serif fonts and sans serif fonts serif and sans serif fonts are generic font family names within the generic font family you find specific font family like Arial within that specific font family you find various fonts like Arial black Arial narrow etc let's see the demonstration and get some idea I go to the notepad here I have already opened the default dot HTML in the notepad it has the basic HTML document structure code written title is set of CSS properties demo already I have opened the default dot HTML in the chrome title he said to CSS properties demo I go to the notepad here in the body section I see some text then I say Br I use a br tag I'm going to copy that and paste a few times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the some text is displayed 9 times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 let me go to the notepad here I'm going to use the font tag opening font and then I say here closing font tag and then I use the face attribute to the face attribute if I say Ariel I'm using the fontname arial then i give a space then I say black Arial black I'm using the font here you can see I'm not using any single quotation to enclose I'm just writing here Arial black okay file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the some text font is changed it is now in Arial black how do i display the second some text also in an area back by using the CSS font family property I use the span tag here I use the opening span tag then I say here closing span tag then Here I am going to say style attribute then I say font - family : I use single quotations to enclose Arial black as it has more than one words I am using single quotations you can see then at the end I put semicolon file save put a browser and refresh you can see that second some text also displayed in Arial black I hope you guys are understanding clearly similarly I am going to copy this font tag and paste here here I can say Arial or simply I say here century I'm using now century as the font face for the 3rd some text here I'm going to say closing font tag file save for browser and refresh you can see 3rd some text is displayed in little bit different font that is in the century font now I am going to copy this span tag from here I paste it before the s and then I say here closing span tag now I am going to use the century font face century this time you can see I am not using single quotations to enclose this font as it has only one word involved I need not to use the single quotations file save to the browser and refresh you can see that for some text is also same as the third some text both are of century font now I go to the notepad before the S I am going to save span opening span tag then I say style equal to in double quotations I am going to say font - FA mi ly family : then I say here single quotation Arial black BL a seek a single quotation comma a RI al Arial then at the end I put semicolon close and here I say closing span tag you can see this time I am using more than one fonts to apply font to some text by using the font family property then we are assigning more than one fonts then we can use comma we cannot assign more than one fonts to HTML font face attribute we can use only one font face but here in CSS it provides you more facility file save this time the fifth the some text is going to be in Arial black refresh you can see that fifth some text is now in Arial black if the Arial black font is not available then browser drilldowns to the Arial font I am going to copy this span I pasted here to fix some text and then here I can use sans - serif sans serif is the generic font you can see that and here I say closing span tag file save this time I have assigned three different fonts to the font-family:arial black we enclosed in a single quotation then arial comma sans-serif file save for the browser and refresh you can see that six some text is also displayed in a Arial black let me show the Times New Roman I am going to copy this span tag paste before this s and Here I am going to say single quotation Times New Roman single quotation then we have semicolon here at the end I say closing span tag file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we are having the same because the default text for this browser is a Times New Roman friends so we are seeing the same output there is no change you can see that I hope you guys have clearly understood how you can use the font family property to apply the font to a specific content of HTML element how we can use the HTML face attribute that is font tag face attitude to change the font of a contender how do I apply all three different attributes of a font tag how do we use it let me use here a br tag to be our I use let's take file save go to browser and refresh you can see the some text are displayed it will be down to this some text I am going to apply by using the font tag okay I use the font tag I say color equal to red then I same font face is going to be Arial then size is going to be for clothes then I say here closing font tag this some text is going to have now size for Ariel face and color red file save put a browser and refresh you can see that it's some text is having now red color for size face is Ariel how do I do the same thing to the last that is the 9th sometimes how do I apply the same styles to the last some text what I can do is I can copy this span and paste here I can say here color colon red semicolon then font - family : Arial semicolon - sighs : I have to use here pixels or I can use predefined values let me use here large value semicolon then at the end I say closing font at this time this ninth some text is going to have the same style as the previous some text file save go to browser and refresh you can see that both of them are having the same style that is how you can use more than one CSS properties to apply more than one style to the content of a HTML element I hope you guys have clearly understood everything about fonts for this tutorial this much is enough friends I suggest you people to try using this font family font face color attribute or CSS properties in your HTML documents in the next tutorial we get more information on CSS for more benefits and be up to date please subscribe to my youtube channel don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
