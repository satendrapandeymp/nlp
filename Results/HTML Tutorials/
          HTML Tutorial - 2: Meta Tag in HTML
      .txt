hello guys welcome to my channel this is the second tutorial in this course the in this tutorial I again have a very simple HTML file for you and we're going to talk about a few more tags and you know a few more things that we can do in HTML using those tags right so what is similar between this file and the one that we checked out in the last tutorial is that it has a doctype tag and as I said in the last tutorial I'd you would have to include this in all the web pages that you make and then on line number two I have the opening HTML tag on line number 12 I have the closing HTML tag and between these two tags I have you know rest of the tags so the head section this time is a little more elaborate and what's a common is the title tag and it has the text you got it and inside the body section I have you know just the paragraph tag this time not the heading type and you know it it has a text I'm a hunter you want to see my gun right so I just show you guys how this file looks in you know in in Google Chrome so it's really very simple you have you have the title here you got it and you see the paragraph text here I am a hunter you want to see my gun so what are these other extra tags are doing here as I said you know as I told you in the last tutorial light within the head section you have you know tags that allow you to save information about your webpage so you know for instance you want to make your website search engine friendly in the sense that you want search engines to be able to find your webpage you know on requests from users you know when you know let's say you search for restaurants in New York so if you have a website that has information about restaurants in New York then you know you would have to inform search engines that okay hey I've got some information about restaurants in New York and you know this is how you're going to tell them so you have to use the meta tag for that so immediately after the title tag you got the word meta between the lesson symbol in the greater than symbol and you know as you must have noticed the Marriott doesn't have a closing time the way the title tag has so the Mara tag is a very simple type to construct you just have to make sure that you have the right attribute and value pairs right and this is very simple to understand what I mean is that after the word meta you have to give a space and then you have to have an attribute that goes along with the meta tag so one attribute that goes along with it is the name attribute and you know since we want to save some keywords about our webpage you use the keywords value within double quotes and after the assignment operator you know after the attribute name name right so name is the name of an attribute and the value that it takes for you to be able to save some keywords about your webpage is keywords right and similarly content is another attribute and you know this is where you're going to put in your keywords so you know going by the example that I gave you so if you if you have a website that has information about restaurants in New York so that's what you will put here you know New York restaurants and the you know maybe names of a few restaurants between double quotes and you know if you have multiple keywords and you would separate them with the comma symbol right and to close this tag you could either use a you know a closing meta tag the way we work with the title tag or you could just put in a forward slash and then the closing angular bracket or the you know greater than symbol right so this is how you include the you know keywords about your webpage you know within the webpage and on the next line I have another meta tag and this one is to save some description of the web page you know again to make it search engine friendly so you have the meta tag again and this time the name attribute takes the value description and the content attribute takes the value meta tags illustration right so this is you know the proper description that I thought you know this web page should have and then again to close it I have the forward slash and the Clos angular bracket and then on the next line I have another meta tag and this one has the attribute HTTP - equip right so that's EQ you IV and this has the value refresh so this particular attribute is used to refresh your webpage and the content attribute this time takes the value two so you know this is the number of seconds after which you want your webpage to be refreshed so I show you guys this page in Google Chrome and you must have noticed that the page is getting refreshed after every 2 seconds right and sometimes you would want this to happen if you want your content to be updated and displayed to users you know after every few seconds and let's say you do not want to redirect the you know your users to the same site after a few seconds you know let's say you want to take them to Google after after after 2 seconds right so what you'll have to do for that is you'll have to put a semicolon after the number of seconds you know as the value for the content attribute in the meta tag and then you'll have to type in URL and then the equal to symbol and then HTTP colon two slashes and then the URL where you want to take them so let's say you want to take them to google.com so you just type in www.google.com here you save your file and I'll refresh this in my browser and this time I see that after two seconds I am taken to google.com right so this is how you redirect users using the meta tags in HTML and that's all I wanted to discuss with you guys in the next tutorial I'll talk about another interesting HTML feature you check out more tags so you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready and take care less you next
