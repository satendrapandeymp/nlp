welcome to web design tutorials for HTML this is lesson number 21 and in this lesson I'm going to talk about how to create a HTML form and I'm also going to talk about how to create an input field for text and also for password so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that you want to do is go ahead and make sure that you have the previous document open from the previous tutorial and once you do that we're going to go ahead and click right after the closing order list tag that we created in the previous tutorial and I'm going to hit the enter key and I'm going to start writing my HTML form so I'm going to right angle bracket the word form another angle bracket and then I'm going to write the closing form tag and that's going to define the starting and ending point for our HTML form and after that we want to go ahead and create an input field for text or basically a place where the user is going to be able to enter their information but before we create that input field for text you first need to give that input field a title in this case I'm going to call it user name colon and after we define that input field title let's go ahead and create an input field tag where the user is going to be able to enter their information so I'm going to right angle bracket input and again that's just defining a tag where the user is going to be able to put their information in to the HTML form hit the hit the spacebar key I'm sorry I almost said enter there and I think hit the spacebar key let's write the word type equals text and basically that's the HTML attribute that's going to tell that input field that hey you're going to be entering text-based information for that field and after that let's hit the spacebar key and then let's write the word name equals and you're going to write user login name and in quotes then angle bracket and I'll get to that last HTML attribute in a moment but for now let's just go ahead and hit ctrl s and take a look at what this looks like in our web browser and as you'll see you'll see that the user name title is showing up in our web browser and our input field is this small rectangle that we see here and if you were to click inside there and write the name Joe or whatever name you want to hit it'll take that field and if you look at it in our address bar you'll see that says user login name equals Jo so basically what just happened there is the the information we entered into the input field was taken in in this case the name is Jo and it also took in that name attribute that we gave the input field in this case it says user login name so if this information was going to your your email address it would take in user login name for the name attribute and the value would be Jo because we entered in the value Jo in that input field so hopefully you understand what's going on here if you don't definitely send me a message on youtube or leave a comment and I'll do my best to assist you so let's go ahead and go back to our HTML form and write the break tag and that's going to create a line break so that our next input field will be on the next line in our in our HTML form and this time I'm going to write a title that says password in : and after we define our title let's go ahead and create our input field and this time we're going to write type equals password because we're creating a password field and for the name I'm going to write name equals and then quotes I'm going to write PWD and PWD is just short for for password okay and then go ahead and hit control s and go ahead and go back to your web browser with the Refresh key and you'll see that now we have an input field for a password and if we were to type in the name Jo again we could do that and then for our next input field if we were to type it would treat it as a password field and our characters would be hidden so that's how you create a input field for a text text-based information and that's also how you create an input field for passwords so hopefully this tutorial was helpful and if it was don't forget to embed comment share subscribe and I hope that you stay tuned for future tutorials have a great day
