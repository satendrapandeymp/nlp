hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and this is tutorial number 48 and in this tutorial I'm going to speak to you guys about the text area element that you can add into your form and if you guys don't know what the text area element does then that is basically that big block of typing space that you can type a whole big message into say like an email or even a youtube comment or something like that so it basically just gives you more space to type something than an actual input type of text so to get started let's go ahead and add this text area tag into our page so text area if I can spell it correctly and I think I'm just going to duplicate that and I'm feeling very lazy at the moment and put a closing slash in there okay and then I'm going to give this text area an attribute and you can probably guess which attribute it is it's going to be the name attribute and the reason why we give every one of our elements a name is because whenever the user Falls data or data or data I don't know how you guys like me to say that word but I say data and a lot of other people say either data or data um data or data so anyway whenever the user files data or data into this text area we need some way of identifying that data and we're going to identify that by the name that we're going to give this text area so I'm going to give this text area and name of story because I'm going to ask the user to tell me a story so tell me a story and I'm going to add a break tag in here for display purposes but now whenever the user was to visit this webpage we get this question over here or rather a yeast like command tell me a story and then the user actually has to tell us the story type it in here okay and then I'm going to speak to you guys about two other attributes that we could place into this text area okay and both of them are actually for resizing this text area so right now you can see we're able to resize it and make it as big as we want but by default whenever we refresh this the text area appears to be quite small so we can make that a lot bigger if we go back to notepad and we could add in two other attributes so I'm going to add in an attribute of rose and I'm going to set that equal to 15 and then I'm also going to add in an attribute of columns and I'm going to set that equal to let's say 60 okay and rows are basically how high you want the text area to be and columns are basically how wide you want the text area to be but this is not a measurement of pixels it's actually a measurement of characters so right now if we were to take a look at this text area without refreshing the page I can add in one two three so by default minam of rows is three rows and my columns well let's go ahead and find that out now so let's go three four five six seven eight nine and zero and okay so that's ten one two three four five six seven eight nine zero one two so by default our amount of columns over here is basically that 10 plus this 10 plus those two so 22 okay and now we can go ahead and actually refresh this and you can see it gets a lot bigger because now we're actually you in the rows that we specified here and the columns that we specified here so we got a lot more space but you cannot you guys can also use CSS to change the width and the height of this text area so if you guys don't want to use inline attributes like this then CSS is a much better option actually so I'm going to go ahead and just save that like that because that's all we have for this tutorial and yeah in the next video I'm going to be speaking to you guys about all sorts of buttons that we can use on our webpage so come back for that and until next time don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like and share this video and I'll see you guys in the next video
