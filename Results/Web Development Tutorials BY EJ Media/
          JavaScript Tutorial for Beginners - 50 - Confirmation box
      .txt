we're going to pick up right where we left off in the last video and of course we hit this button here and we fixed sort of a bug and what we did was we hid this button so that the user couldn't keep hitting it and the text would disappear forever and of course it works but that's sort of bad form not to warn the user that the changes are permanent so what we want to do in this video is add a confirmation box that's what we want to do we want to basically add a confirmation box so that we can let them know that these changes are in fact final so that's what we're going to do in this video so first let's go ahead and add the confirmation box so we're going to put this right here and the confirmation box by the way is similar to the alert box the only difference is you get a cancel button whereas with the alert box you only get a ok' button so there's no other option you have to hit OK and then your code will do whatever you want your code to do so all we do is type in confirm instead of alert and then we're going to put some stuff here in the parenthesis and we're simply going to say these changes are final we could write something like hit OK to proceed but if you want to do that you can I'm not going to okay and then let's just go ahead and put a semicolon here and that should give us our confirm box so let's go ahead and refresh our page and if we hit the submit button we get our confirmation box if we hit OK yeah that's great it did it that's what we said we wanted to do we said go ahead and make the change let's refresh back let's go ahead and cancel out ah it still did it anyways now that's not what we want if we hit the cancel button we want that to keep the original state now why didn't that work well take a look at the code there's nothing to stop it from executing this code right no matter what we do at the confirm box all these lines are going to be executed no matter what we do so we need to use an if statement and if statement to the rescue remember we can deal with multiple outcomes using an if statement so that's what we need to do but before we do that we need to put this confirm box in a variable so let's do that and you know we just write in var and let's just call this confirmation so we'll say that equals and of course our confirm box right here good now what we want to do is wrap all of this code now in an if statement so let's go right up here and of course you know we use the keyword if actually let's give this a space and then in parentheses we're going to put our argument of course and here is where we're going to use our variable and that's why we needed this variable so we could use it down in our if statement and we're going to use an equality operator now which of course is equals equals and we're going to set this to true now we're going to need an extra set of squiggly brackets so let's just copy and paste this here and then we'll need to close it out down here that's all good and so now all this code is now wrapped inside of our if statement so what we're doing here is we're testing to see if it's true remember this doesn't set it to true we're just testing to see if it is true if they hit the OK button if that is true then all of this code will be executed if it's false then as you know all this code will be skipped and it will exit out of the if statement and nothing will happen now we could put an else right down here you could put an else down here remember we dealt with that earlier in the series you could put it else down here and put some code for when they hit the cancel button but we're not going to do that we want it back at the original state so let's go ahead and see if this works so we'll refresh let's go ahead and hit the submit button we cancel and look at that it worked right the code was not executed now let's go ahead and hit this again and let's make sure the ok button still works and it does look at that so that's how you do a confirmation button and you always want to use an if statement if you have multiple buttons in your dialog box and in this case we did and you can keep this set of code for the future when you have multiple buttons you can use this if statement in other words it doesn't have to be this confirm box you could use any type of box or dialog box that you pop up and you could use this same if statement to do something when they hit a particular button okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
