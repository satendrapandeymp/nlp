hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 32 and in this tutorial we are still talking about float and clear so this is indeed the second part to the tutorial and in this video as promised I'm going to show you guys how to float a whole bunch of divs next to each other so that we can create like a three column layout for our website okay and we are going to use this in future when I do create like a website template or something but for now we're just actually going to create the three different columns so to do that let's start off by creating a div and I'm going to end that div off and I actually want to give this class or this div a class and the class can be left underscore column because this div is going to be on the left ok then I'm going to just put some text in here so let's give this some text of div 1 okay and just you know to be lazy let's copy that and paste that here and there so that we have three different divs but let's change this so this is going to be dove two and the next one can be div three okay and classes obviously need to change as well so our first div is going to be on the left so that's going to be Left column a second div is going to be in the middle so we're going to call that the middle column and our last div is going to be on the right so we're going to call that the right column okay so if we save this now and go over to Firefox and run this in Firefox you can see we have give one D 1 to 2 and F 3 so they're not exactly in columns just yet they still appearing beneath each other so we need to get them to appear next to each other but before we do that I actually just want to make them look a little bit more like some blocks or some actual squares or something so let's go over to CSS and actually style these classes so I'm going to grab my left column go over to CSS over here and select my left column and before I style this let's just set everything up so we've got middle column grab that paste that in here and we'll also do the right column so let's go ahead and grab the column from the right and put that in there as well okay and right now we haven't changed anything so let's actually give our div a background color so that we'll be able to see it a lot more clearly so I'm going to give that a background color of blue and then I'm going to give it a height of 200 pixels and we can give it a width of 200 pixels and then I think we can also just change the color of the text to white because this blue is actually gonna be very dark so we might not be able to see our word all our words div 1 on a blue background so we'll change the color to white and that way we'll be able to see them okay and if I'm wondering now if I should put a margin in or not but I think let's just give that a skip so I'm going to save this now let's go over to Firefox over here and click refresh and hey presto we have one big block over here that's for our first div okay and I'm going to just text align that to center just so that the text actually appears more or less in the center okay and what I'm going to do is copy that and paste that in here and in here but we're going to change the background color to red for the middle one and green for the right column so save this now huh and when we go back to Firefox we should have three cool colored blocks so a blue one a red one and the green one how cool is that but again there are still not exactly columns just yet because they're all appearing beneath each other so there's actually one column and not three separate columns so let's go ahead and learn how to get them next to each other and that was where float and clear comes into play so for our first column which is the left column we know we want that to be on the left so I'm going to go ahead and float that left and let's save this and actually go back to Firefox and see what happens click refresh well oh dear what's gone on here we've got our blue div and then our red dove seems to have disappeared but it actually is appear it's appearing it's just behind our blue div so let's go back here and for our middle column what I want to do is float that right next to our left column so that it'll be in the middle and I guess I confuse you guys by saying I want to float it right next to but I actually want to float it next to this div so I want to float it next to the left column and to do that I'm just going to go ahead and say float left again and whenever you do that we land up floating this column our left column left then our middle column floats left next to the left column and appears in the middle and let's go ahead and do the same thing for the right column so you might think well hey oops not float float float left okay you might be thinking well hey this is the right column why don't we floated right and I will show you guys why we're doing this in just a second but let's just float them all left and click refresh and as you can see we've got day of one and then div two floated next to our first div and then div three floated next to at our second div or our middle div so they're all appearing right next to each other and that's pretty cool but let's see what happens if I change this right ative to float right so go pakya and change that to float right then you'll notice that we land up having it float to the right and it leaves a whole bunch of space in the middle okay so whenever I want to create three different columns I want them to be right next to each other unless you know if I put a margin in just to give a little bit of space I still want those two margins of the of the divs to be touching in other words so I just float them all left one after the other and they all appear next to each other which is very cool that's just the way I like it so you don't have any like wasted space like you would over here so let's go back and I'm going to give this a float left again and we'll give this these things all a margin of ten pixels and you'll see they won't be touching each other anymore but they still won't be any wasted space other than the margin which we put there for spacing purposes so now we've got our margin over here but there's no like really huge amount of wasted space as there would be if I took this div 3 or our right column and floated it right and that's all for this tutorial guys so I hope you can hope this helped but in the next video we're actually going to start taking a look at how to create a website temple so we're going to place the header at the top of the page and then we're going to have our columns and our footer at the bottom clearing everything and we're going to make our website appear in the center of the browser and all that cool stuff so I'm going to show you guys a whole bunch of cool tips and a whole bunch of tricks just to get your website layout started and we're also going to learn about some new tags which I've kept right until this last moment so hopefully I will see you guys in the next tutorial and until then don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
