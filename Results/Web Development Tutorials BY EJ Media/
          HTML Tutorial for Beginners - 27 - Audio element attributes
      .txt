we're going to continue where we left off with the audio element tag in HTML now I want to point out one thing you no longer I have to create a value for the controlls attribute or for some of the other attributes that go along with the audio element tag in html5 so this is actually no longer necessary if you have a reason to use it you can certainly go ahead but let's go ahead and actually get rid of this and I'll show you that everything still remains normal so let's go ahead and save this will refresh our page and there you can see the control remains now what if you want the track to automatically play when the webpage is loaded for that we can use the autoplay attribute so let's go ahead and type that in here and let's save this let's actually go ahead and close the page out we'll reload it just to make sure it's working properly we'll reopen this this is an audio test for our test one dot mp3 and there you can see the autoplay worked now what if you want this to keep looping over and over and over again you can use the loop attribute for that so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and this should loop over and over this is an audio test for our test one dot mp3 this is an audio test for our test one dot mp3 this is an awed and it did and I doubt you want to hear my voice over and over and over again so I took mercy on you guys and hit the pause button now there's one other attribute I want to show you guys now this applies to any HTML element it really has nothing to do specifically with the audio element I just wanted to show you guys this attribute that's new in html5 and it allows you to drag any element that you want so again as I said you can put this in any element that you want and you guessed it it's the draggable attribute now this one we do actually have to give a value to and we just set this to true so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and I'm going to have to hit the pause button so this doesn't play over and over again this is an audio tap and there you can see we can actually drag this now anywhere within our web browser now you might be asking well how do we set up receiver how do we set up another element that will receive what we drag and we have to do that in either JavaScript or jQuery so that's for a future lecture ok that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video thank you
