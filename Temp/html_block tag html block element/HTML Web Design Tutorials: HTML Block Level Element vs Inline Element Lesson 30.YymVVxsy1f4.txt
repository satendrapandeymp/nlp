welcome to HTML tutorials this is lesson number 30 and in this lesson we're going to talk about a block level element versus a inline element so let's go ahead and get started the first thing you want to do is make sure you have the document open that we've been using throughout this HTML tutorial series and in this case already had that open so let's go ahead and move forward so dealing with the block level element you need to understand that it takes up a whole block level within your HTML document so in other words when someone goes to your website if they were to see a block level element it's gonna take up the full width or the full block within your HTML website and if you don't understand what I mean don't worry I'll explain it a little bit further a good example of a block level element would be the h1 tag so let's go ahead and look for that and once you find the h1 tag within your HTML document we're gonna actually add another HTML element right after that in this case I'm going to write a paragraph tag and a paragraph tag is going to be dealing with a block level element so let's go ahead and write this is some text and then we'll close the paragraph tag hit ctrl s to save it and then let's go ahead and open this in our web browser and if we scroll down you'll see that this is some text goes to the next line it didn't go right after the HTML web design tutorials which is the h1 tag element instead it went to the next line so in other words where we have HTML web design tutorials it takes up that whole block level and I'll actually have a rectangle that I'll draw around that just to demonstrate what I mean so where you see that rectangle that it takes up that whole block which is the reason that that paragraph tag cannot sit right after the HTML web design tutorials ok and also because the paragraph tag is actually a block level element to it automatically goes to its own new line ok hence the reason is on the next line but in this case let's go ahead and go back to our HTML document and I'm gonna show you what would happen if we're dealing with the inline element because with the inline element it only takes up the space that is needed it doesn't take up the whole block okay so let's go ahead and write a anchor tag right after the image tag that we created so let's look for the image tag and you'll see that the image tag is here but we're actually going to write our anchor or our link right after the anchor that we created for the image so let's go ahead and hit the enter key and we're gonna write a anchor tag right after that in this case I'm gonna use the term Google as my link so we'll write H ref equals HTTP colon or four slash google.com and that's just a HTML attribute which you should already be familiar with that so I'm gonna write the word Google here and then we're gonna close that angle bracket hit ctrl s and then let's go ahead and do this in our web browser I'm just gonna go ahead and hit the Refresh key to refresh the page and you'll see that the Google text is right after the image that we have here okay and of course this image has a link in it already as well but because a anchor tag is a inline element it only takes up the space that is needed so the Google text doesn't go to the next line and that in other words it stays on the same line as the image tag because that's an inline element and also the anchor or the link that surrounds this image is also a inline element so we can place in line elements on the same line okay it's not gonna go to the next block okay and take up that whole space instead it's only gonna use up the space that is necessary so hopefully you better understand what a block level element is versus a inline element to simply put it a block level element takes up the whole block versus a in my element only takes up the space that is needed and I'll actually write another link right after the text Google just to demonstrate that so let's go ahead and go back to notepad again and this time we're gonna create another link and in this case you can name it whatever you want in this case I'll name it let's see maybe just eggs our template calm and put that in parenthesis I'm sorry and put that in quotes and then angle bracket and then we'll write X our template and then it will close the anchor tag hit ctrl s let's go back to a web browser hit the Refresh key and you'll see that the exhort mplet text for the link is on the same line as the Google text is on the same line as the image because it's an inline element it only takes up the space that is needed now if you want it to separate this link a little bit better you could use the HTML entity and I'll actually demonstrate that let's go ahead and go back to our HTML document here and we're gonna create a space between those two links by using the ampersand MB SP which is basically going to create a break space and then semicolon hit ctrl s go back to our web browser hit the Refresh key and now there's a space between that so that people will know that those are two separate links but don't worry if you don't understand the HTML entity part you don't need to know that you just simply need to know that for inline elements it only takes up the space that is needed and a block level element will take up the whole block so if you found this video to be helpful don't forget to embed a
