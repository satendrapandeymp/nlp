hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML style tag here I am going to give you brief information about HTML style tag how it is helpful while creating HTML documents HTML style tag is used to embed CSS style rules that we can apply on various HTML tags or HTML elements as I am providing you brief information about style tag I suggest you to watch CSS video tutorials available on my youtube channel for more information on cascading style sheets or CSS so let's have a demonstration I go to start click on notepad then I write here opening HTML closing HTML tag then I write here opening head closing head opening body closing body in the head section I write title style tag demo closing title I go to file save as I save the file with the name de fa ult default dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and save it at desktop and then I right-click on the default dot HTML page open with the Google Chrome you can see that default dot HTML page is getting displayed and title is set to style tag demo here I have some content I am going to copy that content copy that and paste it in between body tags file save go to browser and refresh this is how our page looks now I am going to format it a little bit properly by using HTML tags that we already learned here I am going to use opening h1 tag and I write here closing h1 tag file save go to browser and refresh this is how the document looks now here I am going to use opening paragraph tag and here I am going to write closing paragraph tag file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks now then here I am going to write opening h1 tag closing h1 tag file save go to browser and refresh and this is how it looks then here I am going to read opening of tag here I'm gonna write a closing paragraph tag file save go to browser and refresh and Here I am going right opening h1 tag Here I am gonna add a closing h1 tag file save go to browser and refresh and then Here I am going to write opening paragraph tag and closing paragraph tag file save go to browser and refresh this is how our HTML document looks after using the h1 and paragraph tags I hope you understand how this formatting is working now what I want is I want to apply for every h1 tag or h1 element a background color of cyan and how do I apply the background color we know that if I try to write here BG color and I write tsiyon I say file save go to browser and refresh nothing happens because there is no BG color attribute with respect to heading tags so it won't work out and how do I apply background colors to each of these heading tags of Zion color here comes the use of CSS cascading style sheets CSS has collection of style rules that we can use to apply styles to HTML elements there are three different ways are there for applying styles to HTML elements inline style embedded style and external style to apply styles using embedded styles we use style tag style tag must be written within the head section and style tag is a pair tag hence I am go right opening style tag and then I write a closing style tag quite simple right and then in between these style tags we are going to write CSS style rules as I told CSS has collection of style rules style rules are going to have style rule name and the value that we want to apply for example there is a CSS style rule called as background - color - that we can assign a value by using the colon and then we can give any value for example cyan color I want to apply right so I can right sign there of course I have written here bag color : Sian that is a perfect style rule declaration but I should also tell to which HTML element I want to apply that style that we can say by writing name of the tag and then VI use flower brackets we are telling to the browser that search for every h1 element in this current HTML web page and apply the background color sign to it quite simple right like this we write style rules if I save file save go to browser and refresh you can see that every heading has a background color cyan quite simple right and also you can see that paragraphs are not affected by the style because we have already told that background color signs should be applied only to every h1 element available in the current web page if I want to apply background colour two paragraphs also we can write P opening and closing flower brackets and there I can say background - color - maybe I can say grey color semicolon if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the background color is set to grey color - every paragraph and if I want to apply more rules I just need to write more rules declaration that's it so here I have written color and then I say white semicolon color indicates text color file save go to browser and refresh you can see that every paragraph text color is set to white we can perform more operations by adding more style rules to these flower brackets to apply more styles on any HTML element for example I can apply a box shadow there is a style rule called as box shadow to that I am going to give some values 5px 5px 5px black semicolon you are going to see a shadow applied to every h1 element file save go to browser and refresh you can see that you can find a shadow effect apply to every h1 tag here so hope you guys are understanding how do we can use the style tag to apply CSS style rules to make our webpages more appealing so I can perform so many operations like I can say here width of the h1 should be 200 pixels and then if I say file/save good browser and refresh you can see that width of each heading is set to 200 pixels maybe it is quite smaller I can say here 400 pixels I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that similarly I can say for paragraphs also I can set the width of 400 pixels semicolon file save go to browser and refresh right we can apply padding we can apply margin so many things we can perform for example padding I give 10 pixels file save you can see that little bit space around the content you can see now our webpage looks more appealing when we start using CSS Styles if you do not write the style tag if you do not write opening end style tags you just have written the rules then those rules will not get applied to s tml elements browser interprets this as a normal content if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it is displaying all style rules as a normal content on the browser so the Mustang should write the style tag opening style and closing style so every style rule must and should be written in between the opening and closing style tag this is how HTML style tag will be helpful to apply styles to our HTML elements and we can create more appealing and well-designed websites by using CSS hope you guys have understood I suggest you to watch once again this video and understand everything clearly if you are having any doubts please post the comment and also watch CSS video tutorials on my youtube channel for this tutorial this much is inner friends for more benefits and be updated please subscribe and don't forget to Like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing see you in the next tutorial thank you guys thank you very much
