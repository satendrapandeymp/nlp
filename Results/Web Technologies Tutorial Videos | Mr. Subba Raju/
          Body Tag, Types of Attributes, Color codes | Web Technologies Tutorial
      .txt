hi guys welcome to nourish a technologies we'll see another video session on bodies section in previous video session I made very clear regarding header section in this video session at least we'll observe a few things in the body section body is the major part in entire the HTML document whatever we are implementing in the body section everything visible to us whereas in the head section logical part now I made very clearly definition body section contains text images video adios frames forms films graphics etcetera body also paid tag inside the body section there are the several local attributes available these attributes we are calling as element specific attributes body tag common attributes are BG color text background these are the three attributes commonly available with the body BG color changing background color of the web page text changing the text color of the webpage and a background we can keep an image on the body now this body section supports some attributes already attributes are red but before we are going to work with attributes what is an attribute what is the important of an attribute what is a parameter attribute means it is an added strength to the tag so every tag having generally attributes some tags are having none attributes some are one attribute some are more attributes attribute is nothing but property in HTML we are calling as attribute every attribute has the related parameter what is a parameter parameter is nothing but a value which we are supplying to an attribute then attribute related information we are going to observe simple I made here very clearly HTML tags can contain one or more attributes as it none also available attributes are always specified in the start tag attribute number we are specifying in the end tag and value attribute value always we are enclosing with the double quotes single quotes no quotes but as per w3c standard double quotation is always valid like that a few points available on your screen just write out parameters parameters are the values that way is an attribute I said already so this is the syntax and this is the example commonly we are showing this and whenever we are going to start with that so tag body attribute BG color parameter is blue I said there are the different types of attributes available before we are going to attributes practically we can try to observe this as useful doctype Allred explain HTML Lang already explained en - I n header section title I am providing raddish I technologies title close meta Care set is equal to - eight header section close body open body close HTML close welcome to HTML document body section just save it come to the concerned of a page refresh welcome to HTML document body section title available narration technologies right once you are coming back our script we are applying attributes here BG color is equal to I am writing hello double quotation single quotation no quotation again I am coming back to my script and I am writing text is equal to read save it and I am coming to source code I am providing background is equal to the concerned image I am providing save it refresh actually one time only image I added it is coming n number of times if you are decreasing is credit it is going to be increasing you are increasing save it is going to decrease no I want only one one image because one image is only added so that time we are unable to control by using HTML you need to control this image with the help of cascading style sheets definitely we can see but first before going to that this is global path all that explain related that in the favicon video global path means my HTML file my image both are in the same location now image I am changing for example that is one animated image i am keeping dot gif save it and if you are going to run that refresh right this is animated image so decrease that perfectly whatever the page available within fraction of seconds I made colorful so that is the power of attribute attribute is added strength to the tag added advantage to the tag more attributes are there tag is more powerful less attribute tag is less power no attributes tag is no power so tag capacity depends on number of attributes now these attributes are local attributes we are calling element to specific attributes were calling no my image available another location now I want to check that image for example my image available in my system in pictures area if I am going to pictures folder in a Windows environment commonly some kind of pics available you can take from there otherwise if pictures not available will go to pictures area I will take some pictures from that area for example HTML your number of images I saved so I am taking a few images different different category images I am taking just these images I am keeping I am showing right from scratch now right-click on that image properties copy the path right to click correctly directly you need to select right click copy it go to your resource area paste there backslash what is the image you need to take it means name is 7.2 jpg no problem number or name or anything just jpg right JP's jpg we are calling joint pictures export group jpg also we can right now I am trying to execute on my web browser yes unable to run I made already why it is unable to run in the previous video session because local path browser unable to recognize some browsers mainly Firefox unable to recognize if I am going to other browser for example Google Chrome Internet Explorer mini opera Apple Safari you see web browser there are the different different web browsers available I will try to show you on other web browsers for example I open Google Chrome there I am displaying my image perfectly displaying so Google Chrome supporting Firefox not supporting because the local path problem is some browsers perfectly some roses unable to that time we are providing file path are we are providing that file colon triple forward slash file save it any browser supports perfectly any browser perfectly support how to control this image I will show you definitely so this is your background image for example my image is available on another website so from that website I want to bring to my web page actually practice purpose you can do this but in the real time industry it must not be implement like this okay for example I want to do click on the GMA once if you are clicking on the Gmail it is going to Gmail at this logo also ok acceptable or here also locally available just right to click on that and you can take into account so come down different different images available just you can take app store right to click on that properties and once you are going to properties copy that once you are copying and the path you can paste in your source code area this is we are calling as web path right and go to your browser refresh yes perfectly display like this we can bring pictures from other websites or other web pages also practice purpose illegal all these are but whenever you are going to work in the real time industry please do not do like this because these are completely copyrights restricted now I am going to same application I want to bring this definitely right click and you can bring it this one also write for example a website available nourish Oh nourish IT dot-com here also several images available yes we can bring those images also click on right to click on that logo and you can copy the path you can provide but always the path are not visible to us sometimes if you are going through some kind of websites okay open that for example okay now I am taking one kind of website like okay Gmail all I am taking is inside the Gmail what available so available here so I want to bring this right to click properties and what is not that so whenever path not available we are unable to work with that of course there is a several ways available but frankly means we are unable to so whenever you are going to inspect element like that also we can copy so this is about your background attribute now here color name we can specify color course we can specify this color course information is nothing but hexadecimal color core system but before we are going to the color code system I mentioned different different types of attributes element specific attributes local attributes a tag which is having particular attributes exclusively for that' tag only those are called element specific attributes global attributes these are only we are calling standard attributes using these attributes we can apply on any tag for example previously our question is there why unnecessarily diagram is repeating here that question I want to clear so now for example this app store is repeating now now I am writing just observe in CSS classes very clearly we can see style background-repeat:no-repeat means I am going to control my image reputation on the web page excellent property like this see in the CSS we can do marvelous things so there we can observe but global property means I shown very clear applicable on any tag ID is a global language I go global already we did that line so like this spell check all these are global attribute global attribute Elias name is standard attributes common attributes dynamic attributes different different names available next one even the handler is nothing but JavaScript related all are whenever you are performing an action on a particular object the related event occurred click double click load or unload like this different blur focus of course every event starts with on keyword so like this available if you are going to see that kind of information especially we need to see about the JavaScript environment so scripting level we can observe all these things script type is equal to text or JavaScript language is equal to JavaScript then you can write function just I am showing one small example by saying this don't think it is a JavaScript class but the situation came there is in a small example I am showing alert I am showing nourish I technologies nourish i technologies write what is a lot also explain the scripting classes then script it flows and you can say same thing simply inside the body and you can add one button button on click is equal to and you can write that my fun my fun and close then you can see take me any text you can say button related information means related words means better I said so meaningful means this is also you can keep at a section and you closed within the script means had a section right available previously whatever information available a few seconds I am going to cut that this is so this is script pot script applause now I am coming to butter level and I am trying to execute this just make bigger and it is script narration technologies so like this information available related to event attributes after that I am coming to optional attributes type is always an optional attribute I am coming back to my previous example here only directly available type type I am removing type just cut it tie brie mode and welcome to narrator technologies for your confirmation purpose I am changing welcome to nourish I technologies so whenever I can say welcome to nourish a technology save and I am executing same example and different browser and click on that now different message game and for example same kind of information and I need to copy to another web browser now here I want to see yes and it is asking aloud because by default it doesn't why in Java C classes we can see script on that welcome to nourish a technologies so this is even two attributes related event attributes related type is always optional or CSS related type is always optional so optional type of attributes other attributes also available this is related to attributes information what is an attribute attribute is a special strength to the tag nothing but property he will attribute ends with value value within single quotation double quotation no quotation final I am coming to another one is color code system what is a color code system how we need to remember these color codes we need to observe periodically one by one then I will show you practically yeah as I discussed it already with UX a decimal color code system so 16 colors are web safe colors this is the way we can implement X our decimal color code system to save over time completely implemented already on the board very clearly first hexa 6 we know already that small a to F or capital A to F both are available decimal means 10 0 to 9 primary colors red the in blue the range is there zero to 255 means 256 like the three colors 256 into 256 into 256 so 16 million values you are getting all 16 million colors so mathematical calculation is values our colors mean 16 million colors we are getting how every color represents two digits Code Red the are our green gg blue BB like that six digits will come plus color code starts with hash symbol total 7 so whenever we are writing these colors least starting with 0 because 0 to 255 0 list 2 55f either capital F or small F so this is the zero zero two digits I said because whenever you are saying two digits zero zero so no color and if you are coming to is the color f FF 2 digits dark color so once we are coming to color codes format it has a different different color codes available here so we'll observe practically that what is color code system and one by one now these color codes available red green blue and starting with hash I provided a FF means red color available and I set 0 no green 0 no blue means zero means don't think one single digit or that I met two digits two digits two zeros to zero these two colors absent I said no color this is only present ready color available again red the green blue observer hash 1300 means no red absent FM is green present zero zero means blue absent so output is a green red the green blue again first hash starting zero zero means an adoption 0 0 means been absent FF miss blue present output is a blue red the green blue hash starting 0 0 means red absent 0 0 green absent 0 0 blue absent means black color generally people are thinking white color sorry least the color and among all those colors is black caste color highest color is white that is FF FF FF white so like this we can develop 6 in a million color coats these color codes practical implementation will try to observe on the system right color codes information one by one so as per w3c standard there are the several color names available these color names we are calling web safe colors these are the 16 safe colors as per w3c standard but these 16 colors unable to satisfy client requirement that time we are coming to color code system that is a hexadecimal color code system practically X are decimal color code system is completely related to digital format for that we can view an example on that symbol for example I am not writing any formal dis directly body and body and body inside BG color is equal to quotation start hash as I said every color code starts with hash EF f red a color 0 0 no color 0 0 no color close save and run on the webpage radical means color code system remembering is little bit difficult but easy also that is a reason of it is different different color Pickers available free of cost if you are going to html5 input type is equal to color if you can say directly color picker can display now some text I am entering what text I am entering for example my organization name I'm entering technologies whenever I am entering nourish ie technologies good and let me copy let me go so like this several times I am copy once you copy that I am changing text color text equal to I said for example hash every color code starts with 0 0 no color 0 0 no color FF blue color right come to the page and execute narration technologies like this color code system is very useful for us this color code system already discussed with you very clearly on the board thank you for watching my videos catch me for more videos youtube.com slash
