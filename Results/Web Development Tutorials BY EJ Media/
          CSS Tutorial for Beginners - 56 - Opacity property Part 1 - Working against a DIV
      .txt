over the next several videos we're going to take a look at some CSS effects and most of these involve css3 now some of the functionality is existing functionality but a lot of this stuff is new with css3 and we'll be covering opacity gradients and even combined opacity ingredients and also cover box shadows and any other subjects that I can think of but in this video we're first going to cover opacity which is the easiest and then we'll move into some more complex subjects like gradients and box shadows so you can see here I've created two div sections and I've given them IDs of box 1 and box 2 and they have exactly the same CSS rules so they are both blue essentially blue squares now the default opacity for every element is always 1.0 the values range from zero point zero which is full opacity all the way up to 1.0 which is no opacity and as I said the default value is always 1.0 as it should be so there's no transparency at all within these sections and that's the word you'll hear also even though the property is opacity you'll hear that buzzword transparent making your elements transparent so we're going to keep box one the same so we have something to compare against so this will remain at an opacity of 1.0 but box two we're going to go ahead and put in the opacity property so it is opacity and let's go ahead and give this a value of 0.4 and of course we need a semicolon so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see this is now looking somewhat transparent now if we set this down to the lowest setting which is zero point zero this should disappear completely and you can see it did this is now completely transparent and there may be some cases you will want to do that we'll talk about that in future videos let's go ahead and set this back to 0.5 so it'll be at the halfway mark and we'll refresh our page and there you can see it's back and it's somewhat transparent now usually with the opacity property you're also going to set up a hover effect with this so let's go ahead and do that right down here and you'll remember this is a pseudo selector but first we need to use our ID selector first so let's go ahead and do that and you'll remember that always starts out with a pound sign and we'll type in box - then of course a colon is what identifies this as a pseudo selector and of course the state that we want to alter is over so that's the one we're going to use and then of course we need the famous squiggly brackets now what we're going to do here is set the opacity to full and this will give kind of a nice transition so when we hover over our element people will know that they are over and over the element because the transparency will disappear and in order to do that of course we need to set this to the highest setting which is 1.0 so when they hover over this element now it should be completely visible so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and when we hover over it look there is now no opacity over on and off and you can see the effect we get so this is a nice little effect a lot of people will use with their webpages now of course in this video we did this for an entire section but you can also do this against images so those are really the two main uses of opacity you'll use it against the section or you'll use it against an image so in the next video we'll actually do this against an image and this will be very similar to what we do here we're just going to use it against a IMG element so we'll do that in the next video see you guys
