that you need to know and need to be thinking about when building your website my course makes it easy by giving you a step-by-step guide with easy actionable steps so you can break down the task of building your website into stages I hope you focus on the most important things are and what order you should do them this video will help you get started using the Divi page builder if you like what you see in this video head over to real website hints.com to find out more about my complete course let's go ahead and get started all right so we're on the back end of our website I've got Divi installed we've got it configured the next thing is to start building pages and learn how to use the Divi page builder so do that we're going to go over to pages and we're going to add new and then we've got the general page settings right here so we wanted to turn on split testing which I talked about in the advanced module as well as just the general look for the page and general page settings like general text color default section backgrounds etc and then this here opens and closes the Divi builder for some reason you wanted to minimize it then we've got this save to library button so if you've created a design here an entire page design or a section design and you wanted to save that to use as a template for your future pages you can click to save the library button and then the load to library button will allow you to load either from the Divi library so there's some there are some pages here that already come with the Divi theme and also if you do add from library this is where your own layouts will be or if you've uploaded layouts this is where they'll show up and then we've got the clear layout which of core empty the entire page this is the undo button the redo button and they see history button and DV is also added a bunch of keyboard shortcuts that we can use to help us edit our page most of the shortcuts work on the front end builder but a few of them work on the back end builder and I'll talk about that in the description of this video so now let's look at this section here and this is a graphical representation of how our page is going to be built this blue bar here and this box attached to this blue bar represents a section so the main thing you need to know about what a section is is a sections all going to have one background one background color one background photo behind it and then inside that section you can add additional rows this is a row here and then inside this green bar here with this white box attached to it is a row and inside of a row you can divide that up into different columns so by default we've got the ability to do a full width column and we break that down into sections as small as one quarter here if you want for some reason to do smaller than one quarter you can do that by using a specialty section even after you've inserted a column so let's just insert one column here you can insert a module and a module is how you add content to your site so there's this entire library of content here that we can add to our site probably the most common ones you're going to be using our images and text and then if we wanted to add another row on below this we can do that by clicking the add row button just like that and it'll ask us which how many columns we want in that realm and then the settings for the sections and the rows are here with his 3 bars this takes us into the special SEC settings just for the rows or just for the sections now when we want to add additional sections we can do that by clicking down here and choosing a standard section so that's going to add a section just like we already have we can add a full width section and now this is a specialty section with specialty modules that are going to be full width to the page and I think that the main use for this or the what I like to use it for the most if you want to have the very top section of your website have one big image with one big title and call-to-action button that takes up the entire window of your viewers browser you can do that with the full width header inside of the full-width section there's a lot of limitations to that you can't kind of do any sort of design you want to it's kind of limited but that's one thing you can do if you also want you want to have a special menu like in the middle of your page you can do a full width menu and then the final thing is the specialty section here and this allows you to do various different combinations and you can see here we've got one column two columns and then this can also be broken down into two columns or one column this will allow us to add more than four columns actually if we wanted to just click on this and then we can insert additional rows like this inside of these columns here so if you wanted to have more than four you can do that this way I generally don't advise I mean you know we don't see very many websites with more than four columns anyways I think it's winds up being too cluttered so I think four columns is a good stopping place and that's what Divi did let's go ahead and we're going to just start building a page I'm just going to remove these extra sections here that we don't need and we don't need this row for this and we're going to go ahead and insert a text module so we're going to go and scroll down to text here and a lot faster actually with the front-end builder we're going to get to in a minute nam because you can actually just start searching for the module that you want to use but right now I think it's just a good idea to know how the backend builder works that way occasionally very very very occasionally there's something a little bit weird with the front-end builder you might want to just switch to the backend builder and so this way you'll know how to use it and also you'll get a better understanding for how the front-end builder works if you know a little bit about how the backend builder works so we're going to make a coming soon page for our website just that we can have one page up that's just ready to go with the most basic information about our business on there so to do that we're going to go ahead and we're going to leave the text color dark for now and when change the text orientation to Center can also change the text orientation down here and some of these things like the text orientation and the text color we can also adjust in the Advanced Settings tab so every module has got a general settings and in advanced settings as well as a custom CSS so if you wanted to add custom code to a section of your site you could do that here but with Divi it's so easy to make modifications there are so many settings you don't really need to add custom CSS to make a great-looking site let's go ahead and we going to type in the name of our business beach town surf shop and let's make this a headline tag going to make it a larger text and using a HTML heading tag and that's what we can do by just clicking here highlighting the text and then just clicking there and if we want to view what this looks like on the front end of our website when we're on the back end builder we can just click this little eye icon right here it's going to show us what this section on the front of our website looks like it doesn't show us our whole page it just shows this one section here alright that's great so now let's do save and exit it's important to know about they save an exit button here is that that just saves it on the page while you're editing this page it doesn't actually save the whole page so save the whole page you either need to click on the save draft button here this publish button or one that after the websites been published the publish button will turn into a save button also and so it's in save draft mode it's not visible to our viewers who aren't logged in to the website it's only viewable to us and when we click the publish button it's live on the web so to insert one more module and we'll sort of give another line of text I'll Center this also say your source for custom surfboards and and surfboard repair and we'll go ahead and now we can view again just to see what the section looks like we go let's make this a little bit bigger by giving it an h2 tag here and then we'll click save and exit now some of the things we can do with the text if we want the text to be larger on the front end of our website we can click on the Advanced Settings tab here and then since we've gave that a headline tag we can use this header font size and just make it a little bit bigger and then we can preview it here make it a little bit bigger even all right that's great save and exit so now let's go ahead and start working with the front-end builder so the first thing I want to do is save this draft so we don't lose anything just in case when we switch to the front and builder we don't want to lose anything probably won't but I just like to be safe just save early save often and let's go ahead and click on use the visual builder okay so now we're here on the front end of our website and you can see there's the text that we added and now we can see these various different colored highlights that pop up so the blue represents sections the green represents the rows and we can adjust the columns by clicking on this column button here and then the gray represents the modules that are inside there so we want to add a new row here we can just click on the green button do a full width row and let's go ahead and add a email opt-in form so we're going to click on this and let's give this a name and you can see as we're typing here the text is being added in we can see what's going on we also move this window around so we can get a better view of what our page is looking like and what the edits that we're changing or making this is really kind of a revolutionary feature for WordPress and definitely for the Divi theme so the front end builders are very new to WordPress and I think Divi is doing an excellent job of making great front-end builder and we can choose whether we want to have a background color for this or not I like the background color in this case we might change that later and text light or dark text orientation left or centered then we'll just add some more text here okay there we go and let's go ahead and make this text a little bit bigger so it's easier for our audience to read so the header font here just make that let's leave that about like there and of course this is going to change depending the size of the window that your viewers are using so you want to keep that in mind and then let's also adjust the body size make that a little bit bigger like this then we'll click check here so now let's look at the settings for this section and let's give it a cool-looking background so we're going to click on this little gear icon here and then now we're looking at the section settings so we've got the general settings and we can add custom CSS we're going to add a background image so we just click on upload here I've already uploaded the image but if you wanted to upload it from your computer all you do is click on upload files you can either drag files from your computer onto here or you can select files and then just click on it right there and it will upload it and I've already optimized this picture and if there's a video in the course on how to optimize your images is really important to do that to make sure that your site loads quickly for your viewers let me go ahead and select this alright and there we go so we have this image and just about all the images that I used in this course from unsplash comm and I've got a link to unsplash and these and this particular image and the description below and also on my website real website hints.com i've got a post that shows you various different places where you can find free to use images for your website so now i've got a background image for our web page now let's go ahead and continue to make some modifications here so let's add some space up here above and below so that we can see more of the picture so to do that we're going to click on the plus icon here to add a new module and the module that we want to add is the divider module so you can just type in div and we pulls up the divider module and we can give it a height so I'm just going to give it a height of 100 to start out with you can see that divider module came in between our title of our shop that we put in here and the sort of tagline that we put below that so to move that we just mouse over to the gray box where the divider is and we just click on that cross and we just drag it up above there we go and then we can duplicate this just by clicking this little icon up here that looks like sort of two boxes on top of each other that'll make a copy of that and we can drag one of them down below there so now it's filling up more the screen and starting to look you know kind of fun and interesting as you can see how easy and once you understand what the backend builders doing how intuitive how intuitive it is to use the front-end builder really cool thing that Divi has two is the ability to use keyboard shortcuts so if we want to save our progress so far which is always a good idea save early save often so you don't lose anything you just push command or ctrl s just like you would do anything else you can see down here it says saving Draft so it's saving this page right here and then down here at the bottom we can actually open and close this and this is sort of the general page settings here we can also view what this page is going to look like on a tablet by clicking the tablet button here and on a knife Divi does a pretty good job as you can see here sort of doing optimization by itself so when a section of this course later on we're going to talk about how to optimize your pages for the use on different devices to make sure that all of your users no matter what device that are on are getting a great experience okay so let's add a background to this section here or to this row here so we can read this text easily easier we're going to make it sort of slightly transparent section so to do that we're gonna go to the row settings right here you can see how it highlights the row right around where that text is just going to click on settings we're going to click on design and I'm going to add a background color just by clicking here it's going to choose black and when you change the text to white in just a moment you can already see a problem there but we're going to fix that we're just going to drag this down do I get a same a transparent header like that I'm going to click OK and let's add one more section here just like this do one row and let's drag this let's drag this up here to the top and let's move our divider into this that it's separate from where our text is and you can do that you can just move things between rows just that easy and now let's change this text to be light let's change this text here also to be light so we go looking pretty good so far and let's just add one more section right below this and we'll just put it in our address so do that I'm just going to go ahead and duplicate this row here since we've got all the settings already in there there's a cool function in Divi theme all of the keyboard shortcuts which I was mentioning earlier if you just push the question mark button it's a shortcut that will show you all of the keyboard shortcuts that you can use when you're using the front-end builder like this so if you use command Z it'll undo command Y will redo etc so just really a bunch of really cool features and as you get to know the Divi builder you're just going to get faster and faster at building pages and features like this really help just go ahead and drag this section here below our signup box let's see we've got that divider in here so we'll add in one more section here with one row move that down below and then I'll move our oops it didn't move I'll move our divider and here move our divider and here and then I'll move this section down here there I go okay so now let's put in our address and phone number you can actually edit text just by clicking into it just like this so we can go and then if we don't like editing like that because right now when I push enter it's going back to the standard size which is actually probably what I want we can just click that you can just push the escape button and it's going to take you out of that text editor that sort of live on the front end and we can click on the gear icon and then we can go back and use the visual builder here so let's change all of this let's actually use an h2 tag here so and then we'll just type in our address and then to make all this text same size go ahead and just change that to an h2 tag click check and then we'll use this to modify our phone number you can just click right in and you can start editing right here so we go now we've got a really good nice-looking splash page that we can use while we're building the rest of our site behind now the one problem is is that we still have our title and menu bar up here and since we don't want our visitors clicking around on our site since it's not finished yet we want to go ahead and change that so that title bar doesn't show up so let's go ahead and save our settings here and then we can either click on exit visual builder or we can just click right to edit page and then what we need to do here is to change the page template down here from default template to blank page and a blank page is going to move the header area along with the menu section and we can click on update so now our page is live and then we can go ahead and view the page by clicking view page up here there we go so now we've got no menu up here just the menu because we're signed in to the back end of our website so these are our editing controls wonderfully signed out they wouldn't show up so we go so that's an introduction to the Divi builder and how it works and how to sort of start using the front-end builder if you are browsing around in your site and you want to start editing a page all you got to do is just click on enable the visual builder up here and you can go ahead and just start editing your page again and then you can just exit the visual builder I definitely recommend saving before you exit there is a warning that has it comes up sometimes to remind you to save your page when you've made changes but doesn't always work like right now it didn't work for example so always a good idea just click on this button down here that it opens up the page settings and you can click on save over here on the bottom right to save your changes and then exit the visual builder so the next video we're going to look at how to use Divi page templates and how to quickly and easily
