in this video we're going to discuss four elements the bold element the strong element the italic element and the e/m element now the bold and strong element are very similar but there are some subtle differences and the italic and the e/m element are very similar as well with some subtle differences so we'll discuss those differences in this video as well so to make our text bulb we use the B tag which gives us a bold element so let's just go ahead and do that really quickly and we'll just go ahead and copy and paste this over here and of course we need to close this out now so let's go ahead and save this let's hit refresh and there you can see we've got our bold text now let's go ahead and create a strong element and you guessed it the name of the tag is strong and then let's just go ahead and copy and paste this as well over here to close it out and let's do that and then let's go ahead and hit save let's refresh now you're going to take a look at this and go what is the difference here visually and the answer to that is there is nothing different visually they look exactly the same because visually they are the same well what's the difference well in fact there is a slight difference and the strong element in addition to making the text bold also adds emphasis to the text and what do I mean by that well it adds some additional information and that means it can be used in different ways and perhaps the biggest difference is that the strong element can be used by text-to-speech programs which of course are used by blind people with a bold element you do not get that it's just purely for style so again with the strong element you can place emphasis on certain words even though stylistically the two elements look exactly the same so if all you care about is the visual style then by all means use the bold element now I will say that going forward if and when there is an HTML 6 they might add additional functionality to the strong element but not to the bold element so you may want to just use this for future purposes as well now the italic and e/m element have the same relationship basically the e/m element also adds emphasis in the way the strong element does and it can be read by text-to-speech programs which again are used by blind people but let's go ahead and put both of these elements in now so we'll just do that and we'll go ahead and just close it out and let's just go ahead and put the EML iment in as well because we can and let's go ahead and save everything up let's hit refresh and there you can see we've italicized some of our text now and again the e/m and the italic element look exactly the same but once again the e/m element just like the strong element add some additional information to the text okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
