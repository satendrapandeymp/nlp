hello and welcome back to another HTML tutorial with meemic nerd three-two-one today we are covering tables now as you can see we've got a fairly complex table ething setup here and all the code is complex at least even if it doesn't look it then down here we have a slightly simpler to people as you can see when I highlight it you can tell where the table is split up so this has two rows and two columns I've called them cells because that's just easier when you're thinking about the code that's behind it and they're not it's just so that the two tables was based out of it and didn't look like they're all part of the same thing so we'll start by looking at this this simpler table down here looking at the code behind that to get you started with tables now the code for that is down here it is this section here so as you can see you begin a table with the table tag fairly simple helpful they've given it a decent name now to define a row which is what you do first you define it by rows and then within those rows you put cells or the TD elements which form the columns so we'll start by defining a row and I'll leave this going across the page so it's a bit clearer to you in terms of the layout on the screen and we'll have another row beneath it that's complaining at me because I haven't put anything in it now let's say in our first column we wanted I dunno it to say hello and so we put that in that TD element and that will come up in the first column on this row now if we want to do another column we are at in another TD element and within that we would say hello to and then if on the next one we didn't want anything in the first column we would just put an empty TD element which it's probably gonna moan at me about but it works and then in the next one we would put whatever we wanted to appear in /td boys remember to close off your things kids right so in this one we would say hello for so there's no hello three because we didn't feel like having it so that should display as an empty cell or empty column on the left which if we refresh it does it automatically ignores this just doesn't put anything in there because we left empty and instead in the second column it puts hello four so that's how you define a table you use TR for the row so I want another R it'd be another TR element and then within that you put the TD for each column that you want to have content in you couldn't just leave this bit out entirely because then it would put hello for in the first column underneath just hello you would have to put in all the empty I mean things and it's just a pain but that's is how tables are defined in HTML so if we wanted something that was then right at the very end and completely abstract and not related to anything else in our table but sort of formatted in the same way we would have three of these TD I will put spaces in so it's a bit clearer for you to see so if we wanted something on the third column we would then put it in here so this is gonna mean I don't know don't know what the number is I've lost track and then we would refresh the page and you see that it's put it in like its own third thing so if I highlight this you can see that these are just empty there's nothing there but they are defined so it's as formatted this all the way over here in a third column on its own now this more complex table that will you saw up here has headers and footers defined which is why this bit is in bold and that pit says put a thing and if you see when I highlight it there are slightly bigger gaps between that's just a way of telling that they are header and footer elements it's not particularly important but they are used because when you think about if you've got a massive table with loads and results on on a web page and something wants to print it most web browsers now interpret the head and they put that at the top of every single page so if you have like column titles that were important for all the pages then you'd walk them on all the pages and the web browsers will hopefully interpret to the header tag and put that on every single page at the top and the same with the footer tag they should put that on every single page at the bottom and then this bit in the middle is effectively just a normal table that goes in between the two but the way it's defined slightly different you define it with the header first so to do that we have our open table tag and we close that off right down here at the very end and then between them we start off with a tea head tag which stands for table header then within that we basically define a normal table except we don't use TD for the columns we use th which as you can see flushing up there and I hover over it specifies that a cell in the table is a header cell that will only work within this properly if you want it to go at the top of the page but if you just want something to be in bold then just use th normally so I could make this one a th and it would make it out to bolt if i refresh the page you will see that there we go that one's now gotten bold but that is just again something to do with the formatting and CSS which we will be moving on to next week I'll be doing some simple tutorials on that and sort of colors bold font styles with height things like that that sort of the basics of making things look nice and interesting and not just plain black text on a white background which can be quite boring if you want to visit a really interesting and amazing website that you're creating so we have the tea head and then within that just normal table rows with th columns defined within them that case is our table header now down here we then define the table footer your logically expect that the table body would come next but no you have the table footer and within that again you do a table row and then normally it's just sort of TD that you could use but if you wanted the footers to be in bold as well you could use th but these these are tea footers and tea headers are also helpful if you're formatting a table using CSS and you'll see next week they can be used so that all of these rows and cells have a slightly different font color or style to all of these rows and cells or all of these Rosen's cells you can define them as separate things as you will see soon but then after the T footer you can then move on to T body and in there you just dump normal rows and cells again like the footer but this time when it reads the page you see that it's put the body in the middle so as you can see on the code I've said T footer and within that is foot a thing and it's put out at the bottom even though it's defined before the T body so hopefully you guys get that and that's a basic introduction to tables basically explaining the difference between T header T body T footer and how to define rows and columns like we did down here and next week as you can see down here we are moving on to basic styling and CSS you
