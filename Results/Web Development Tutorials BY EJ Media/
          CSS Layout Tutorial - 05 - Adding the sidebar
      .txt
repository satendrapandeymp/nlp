welcome to the fifth tutorial on CSS layouts so we're continuing along from the last video and we set up the main content pane now we're going to add a sidebar and we're going to float that to the right and so the main content pane and the sidebar will be next to each other and so we'll have the classic two column layout you probably have heard that so let's go ahead and close this out so first thing we're going to do is we're going to update our index.html and we're going to place this div right below our main div so let's go ahead and do that and we'll just come down here and I've already typed this out so we'll copy and paste this right here I will copy and paste this by the way into the message board in case you don't want to type this out so there we go now we're going to use a class the same thing we did with the main content pane we're going to use a class again and we're going to call this side right I like to call it side right you can call it sidebar if you want but if you decide to put a sidebar on the Left it's easier to figure out in your CSS code which one you're dealing with so we're going to go ahead and call this side right we're going to use a h2 heading instead of an h1 it's a little bit smaller than an h1 because this will be a little bit of a smaller window and then I put in some sample content here and this is sort of a fake history website we've been working on so I was thinking well we might have some lectures or something let's say our website offered that now let's go ahead and create the CSS code for our side right so we'll just do a copy and paste of this right here and of course we will call this dot side right and you will remember that the dot stands for a class we're going to keep the same background color as our main and we're going to keep the margins at 10 pixels we're going to keep the border radius at 5 pixels or even can you keep the padding at 20 pixels oh it's very similar but we're going to knock down the font size percentage just by 5% so this will be a hundred and five percent and then we're going to use the float parameter so we're going to float this right and you'll remember in the last CSS series we talked about that if you do a float you must give the element a width so that's what we're going to do we're gonna give this a width of two hundred and sixty pixels so that's a little bit different than the main content pane on the side right we're only going to allow this to be 260 pixels wide so let's save everything here and let's open up our web page actually before we do that I made a couple rules for the h2 heading as well so I just copy and pasted it right here and so we'll put this font size at 120 percent and the color as dark blue so let's go ahead and save our stylesheet yet again and now let's open up the web page and there you can see we've got our sidebar but you'll notice that they are not side by side so we don't have our two column layout so what is going on here well this is where things start to get a little bit strange with floating now you will remember that we didn't put any width in our main element so what's going to happen here is the browser is going to paint the header first then our nav bar and then the main content pane and because we didn't put it with here it's going to size it to the entire length of the browser so there's no room for our sidebar now the other issue is that the browser is always going to stretch this all the way to the right so we have to actually move this element in our HTML code before the main element so that this will get rendered first it will float our sidebar over here and then this element also then will fit the open space because remember the side element is not in the flow you will remember we talked about the flow in the last CSS series this is not in the flow so this also will be side to side so let's go ahead and do this now I actually don't want you to do this right now so if you're following along just stop and watch this part because we're actually going to move this back and I'll show you why so we're going to go ahead and move this above the main div so we'll put it right up here we'll copy and paste that and then we'll get rid of this and again I don't want you to do this right now we'll save this and we're going to go ahead and voila it worked but we've got another problem remember our side element isn't a float so think of it like it's floating above the page the browser is doing exactly what it should do it's going to go ahead and paint this main div still and this since this is out of the flow it's just going to float right above this but we don't want that we want our little gutter here of margin space that we talked about in the last couple videos so what we so the easiest way to do this actually I like to do is to move this back and then we'll have to make some space and we'll talk about a couple strategies that you can use so let's close this out and let's go back and copy and paste this here get rid of the one up top here let's save this again and it should be back to well somewhat normal now there's a couple things we can do first is we could set a fixed length on our main pane but we don't want to do that remember we want this to stretch all the way if people resize our browser we want this thing to stretch right into our side element so we really don't want to set a fixed length here that kind of goes against the idea of a liquid website so we still have to make room and the way we're going to attack this is we're going to use margins we're going to set a merge in here and we're going to push this margin all the way over so we can fit our sidebar right into here so let's do that we'll just close this out and we'll go up to our main and we've got to play around with its margins now so let's get rid of this margin here of 10 pixels and I've already typed this out so I'll just copy and paste it in here and so the margin left is going to remain at 10 pixels but the margin right is going to be 320 pixels and I'll explain why and then the margin top and the margin bottom are going to be both 10 pixels so let's save this and let's go ahead and open our web page again and there you can see we looks like we have the correct space here doesn't it now you might be wondering well why is this still down here well again we have to move this above our main content pane and we'll do that Amit but I want to explain how I got that 320 pixels so we'll close this out now what happened here was that you basically have to add up the space that we need to fit our sidebar in there so the width it was 260 pixels plus the padding on the right and the padding on the left so that would give us 300 pixels and don't forget the margin on the left in the margin right which is 10 pixels that gives us you guessed it 320 pixels and so let's go ahead and move this and now you can do that so we will copy this and then get rid of it we will put it right above our main div we will save everything up here and we will open up our web page and there you can see everything fits nice and neat and now this is nice because this will size accordingly no matter what the user sets their browser to this will size accordingly but it will never come within 320 pixels of the right edge of the browser that space will always be reserved for our sidebar because we put that big margin in here and what's nice about that too is we really don't want to expand this out we really don't want this to be liquid we want our main content paint to be liquid because this is the main content that the people who are using your website are going to be looking at so it's better to have this become larger and larger not our sidebar now you may be wondering why is there 20 pixels here and there's only 10 between the rest of our elements now you will remember in the last CSS series we talked about divs and how the margin space between them works and you will remember that it cuts it in half so even though both of these elements have ten pixels and it should be 20 pixels the browser will cut it in half and make it ten but remember our sidebar is not in the float so the ten pixels it has gets counted along with this navbar element that makes 20 pixels now to get rid of that's pretty simple let's go up here and just borrow this code right here in our main div and we'll copy and paste this down over our 10 pixel margin here for our side right element and what we're going to do is we're going to give everything 10 pixels except for the margin top we want to make that zero pixels and let's go ahead and save this and let's open up our web page and there you can see everything is size nice and neat now so that's going to do it for this vid in the next video we're going to add some more content panels so I'll see you guys then
