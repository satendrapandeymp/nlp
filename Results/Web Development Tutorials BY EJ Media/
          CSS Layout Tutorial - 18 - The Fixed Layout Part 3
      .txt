in this video we're going to continue on with our fixed layout and let's take a look at our webpage for a moment here and what we want to do is add a mini content panel in here to our main content panel so it will look like a tile and people are doing that today adding a lot of tiles and their content panels and then people can drill down into those actually the drill down actually involves master and content pages and we'll get to that in a few videos but before we get to that topic we need to actually set up a mini content panel so we're going to do that in this video now the first thing we want to do since this mini content panel is going to be within our main content panel we want to nest that div inside our main content dip so we're going to create another div and I've already typed it out so we'll just copy and paste it and we'll put it right here and there you can see now we've got our box inside our main content panel so again this will be our mini content panel right here now let's go ahead and put some content in here so we'll just put a paragraph in here with some text and again I've already typed this out so I'll just copy and paste it into here and so here's the paragraph which reads in this series we are going to cover ancient Rome so this mini content panel will be a Content panel about Rome and so there you see we've got our paragraph element with some content inside of our new mini content panel so now let's go ahead and add some CSS so we can go ahead and style this new mini content panel and we'll use the same formula will put our nice comment section here that says this is a box actually let's actually call this mini content panel because that's what this is and then we'll add our CSS in here so I'm going to go ahead and paste all the properties in here then I'll explain each one of them because I've already typed all these out so we're going to have the background color set to a dark gray and so there's the hex code we're going to use a two pixel wide border and so that's why I've got right here we're actually going to put a little border radius in there to curve the edges the font size we want a little bit smaller than the rest of the webpage so we're going to keep that at 95% um we're going to add ten pixels of padding remember that padding goes around our text so we don't want that right near the edges and we've talked about that in many of the other CSS tutorials so we'll put patting around our text we're going to add a margin of 20 pixels and you'll remember that will push our div away from the edge of this div so we don't want these right next to each other so that's what the margin will do we're going to have a width of 280 pixels now you can resize this if you're going to use this for your own website you can resize this as you need be maybe you want this a little bit smaller but we're going to use 280 pixels for this tutorial and the color of the text will be white so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get now good that's a good start we've got our mini panel now we've got our text we got the padding to push away the text from the edge and we've got some nice margin here that pushes it away from the main content panels edge so that's looking pretty good but we want to do a little bit more here we want to make this look a little bit more dynamic so let's add an image into here and then we'll make a link out of that image so that we can drill down into another web page which as I said we'll be doing later on when we do master and content pages so let's go ahead and add an image now we're going to go right back into our box div and I've got this all typed out so I'll just go ahead and copy and paste it in here and we're going to create another paragraph that will actually hold our image here's the other paragraph so this will be our actually our first paragraph and we're going to create a class this time because we may want to use this for other images if we create other mini content panels we may want to actually reuse this class so again it'll be a class called test and we'll get to that in a minute now we're going to create a link and you'll remember from previous videos we always use the anchor tag now target we can keep blank now href remember that's what we're going to link to is called Rome dot HTM now here's where our content page will be now this is just a placeholder right now this will be the name of it when we get to the master and content pages but this is going to be called Rome dot HTM so that's what we're actually going to go ahead and link to but we obviously we're not going to create that in this video and here is our image Rome dot PNG now I've already put that in the folder now if you want this actual image if you go out to let me close this for a second I want to open this up with paint but if you go out to Google and you type in ancient Rome you'll see this down I think halfway down or something so you can use this image now depending on the size of your content panel you may need to reduce the size of it I actually reduced it I think like about 50% or I think of 75% to make the image smaller now the reason we want to do this in paint is because you want to do all your image reduction in Microsoft Paint or in Photoshop you don't want to use CSS to reduce the image because the images original size will be sent to the browser and then the CSS will reduce it but that's a lot of overhead you don't want that type of overhead so always reduce the images before they get sent to the clients browser so again I called it Rome and so we're all set to go and so now let's go ahead and actually take a look and see what we got and there you can see this looking better we've got a little hand here so when we add our content page we can drill down into it and we've got our text so it's all looking pretty good but we want to Center this image don't we we don't want this to be hanging on the left here so let's go ahead and add some more rules and we're just going to add it to our class that we already created here test and so we can add some properties or rules here that will Center our image and so we'll go ahead and put it over here in our CSS and as usual I already got typed down so I'll just copy and paste it over here and you know what we don't need to create a comment section for that we'll just we'll put it in here notice we're using the dot because it's a class and as I said we may reuse this to Center other images and other content panels so it makes sense not to make this a unique identifier you know what we might have wanted to make this a class but we'll leave this as a unique identifier for now so what we're going to do is we're going to kind of vert this to a block remember we need to convert this from inline because remember that's the default for an image and we want to convert this to a block and then we just use the text align property to Center it and we'll open this up and here you go whoa it didn't Center it what did we do wrong oh boy okay let's close this out and I always hate that when it doesn't work but we can figure out what we've done wrong let's always look at the CSS first and it looks good from this point of view I don't see any problems and then take a look at the HTML and I spotted the problem you guys see it I don't know if you see it there's an extra closing tag here which we don't need so we have an extra closing tag when we didn't need it so let's go ahead and get rid of that it's always something right all right let's go ahead and see if it works now yes it does and so that looks really good we've got our image now people will read this little tidbit here to know that this is a drill down or even saying please click on the image above will click on that so I will see you guys in the next video
