in this video we're going to take an initial look at events and of course we've been using events throughout the series we just haven't talked about them much because we focused on some other aspects of JavaScript but now we're going to take a look at events and for the next several videos I'll be introducing a new event in every video now in this video we're going to take a look at an event we've already used the on click event and that's good because we want to really talk about what events are and why we use them now almost every great website today is a responsive website now how do we make a website responsive to the user we do it through events and events quite simply happen most of the time when a user does something on the webpage they could click on a button they could hit a keystroke it is events that respond to something happening on our web page and it is events that in turn trigger our JavaScript code to respond to the user and that is why javascript is an awesome language because we can react to our users in a very dynamic way now the technical term they use is event handlers all that means is we create code in this case JavaScript code to handle the particular event that occurred and we've been doing event handlers that is we created our JavaScript functions they get executed when an event occurs so as I said the good news is we've already been doing a lot of this but now it's just time to break down what events are now there are two types of events those were the user actually does something like click on a mouse move a mouse perform a keystroke something like that and then there are events that are not necessarily triggered by the user but are triggered by something else for instance there is an event that gets kicked off when the web page loads and that is called the onload event and we'll be covering that in a future video so there are two main steps that we must do every time we create an event the first is we have to choose the element where we will place our event in this case we're putting it in the button element so our event is on click and when we click the button the event gets triggered and it will trigger our function our JavaScript function right here which will intern X cute the code that we want to execute in this case it'll change the color of this text so that first step remembers we have to take this event and put it in a AML element and as I said in this case we put it in the button element because it has to be associated with some element on our page otherwise nothing really will happen so that's the first step the second event is we have to choose the type of event we want to use in this case we're using the on click event and that is just a single click now you can actually do multiple events but that is for a future video in this case we're only worried about single events but you can actually trigger multiple events but in this case we're just going to pick the on click event which gets triggered of course when we click our submit button so just remember it's a two-step process you have to bind it to an element node and then you have to pick the type of event that you're going to use now when the event happens yes something has to happen in other words the button click until that our JavaScript code is just sitting there waiting to be executed but once that event happens the event triggers our JavaScript function which in this case is change color and then our JavaScript code gets executed so again this code is very recognizable we didn't really change anything up in this video I just wanted to talk about how you create events and in the next video we'll actually introduce a new event but let's go ahead and run this code and we're just going to do what we've been doing we're going to just get the element ID we know what that is and we're just going to change the color to blue so let's see what happens we'll actually fire up our webpage here now nothing has happened right this webpage got loaded but we haven't actually clicked on anything so the event has not been triggered now when we hit the submit button the event got triggered it triggered our function and then it went to our code and then it's a two-step process over here remember we have to get the element ID and then we have to do something to the element that we want to change in this case we want to change the paragraphs text to blue okay that's going to do it for this video in the next video we will introduce a new event see you guys
