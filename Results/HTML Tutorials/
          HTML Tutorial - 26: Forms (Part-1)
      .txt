hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 26 to total in this course and in this tutorial we'll be checking out forms in HTML N and probably I'm going to divide our discussion on forms into tutorials and this might be a little inconvenient for you because I'm going to use part of what we build in this tutorial in the next tutorial so you know you you you would probably want to check out both tutorials you know in one go and the reason why I'm doing this because if I discuss all you know form aspects in wanted oil and the tutorial will become very long and I don't want that so anyway let's just get started on line number one here in this file I have the doctype declaration then you know I have the head section in the body section and then between the body section I have you know lot of text that we haven't seen till now in the course and this one this file if you open it in Google Chrome this is how it looks so at the moment it has just this form has how many fields just one two and three fields so you can enter your first name your last name and you can tell your gender you know whether you're male or female so we have two different kinds of input forms and the first one is a text box that you see here and then you also have radio buttons and the special thing about radio buttons is that if a time I can only have one option selected so you know a person can either be male or can be female like you know at the moment these are the only options you have and you have to choose just one of the two whereas if you have something like checkboxes you know you can select multiple checkboxes and you know whatever variable you're setting with those values that variable can take multiple values for gender for instances is a variable that can take only one value and so is age you know like if it's selecting among age categories this is something that you see fairly often in survey questionnaires that you have age groups to select from so you know you can have you can either be in the age group 18 to 25 or you can be in the age group 25 to 30 it's not that you can belong to both age groups so in those situations again you use radio buttons whereas if you're selecting ways in which people can contact you through email through SMS or you know through call then you can have checkboxes am you know checkout checkboxes in maybe the next tutorial but in this tutorial let's see how we can construct this much so this is the HTML file and I want you guys to have a look at what I have on line number nine so I have the you know the text first name which is between the opening and closing paragraph tags on line number eight and 15 respectively so I have two text first name then a colon so you know this is where this is displayed first name and the colon and then I have the input tag so between the opening and closing angular brackets or the less-than and greater-than symbol you type the word input and give a space and type the word type right so you have to specify what kind of form control you want to use so if you want a simple text box then you just type in text between double quotes right and then you also have to give a name to your form field so this is how you would distinguish this text box from the text box that's going to taken then the last name for your user so you use the name attribute for that so this is going to be the name for this form field so you type in name the equal to symbol in between double quotes you type in whatever name you want to assign to the fields so if you want to assign first underscore name you can type in that if you want to just type in the alphabets FN that's also cool so you know that's up to you whatever name you want to give to the field you may and then you give a space get in the forward slash and the closing angle bracket and that's it you know you'll get your form field and then to have some space between the first field and the second field I have to you know be our tags here and then I have the same procedure for last name field again I have last name colon and then I've used the input tag with the type text and the name for this field is last underscore name and then again you have the forward slash and the closing angular bracket and then again I have BR tags here and then finally I have the radio button field here so I have gender : which is same as you know for the previous two fields I had first name : last one : here I have gender : and then I have used the input tag but this time the type for the tank is radio instead of text it's radio and you know I have given the name gender to this field and I have the value male for the male radio button and I have you know just copied this and used the value female for the female radio button and you have to make sure that you know if for one particular variable like in this case it is gender if you have five different values then the name for all the fields has to be the same so the name for the first field which is for male is gender and for the second one is also gender whereas the values are different so the value for the first one is male and the value for the second one is female if you change the names then people will be able to select multiple radio buttons as well right so this is something that I want you guys to understand like here say if I change the value of gender to gender underscore new and save this file and if i refresh it in google chrome I'll be able to select male as well as female right and this defeats the purpose so you know you don't want this so I'm gonna change this back to gender and I save the file and this is what we want we can select only one option at a time right so we're gonna check out more form controls in the next tutorial and if you have any doubts regarding any of this feel free to comment on the troll or you could also reach out to me in other ways send me messages or you know catch up with me on facebook or you know send me an email and I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel I'll see the next video till then take care
