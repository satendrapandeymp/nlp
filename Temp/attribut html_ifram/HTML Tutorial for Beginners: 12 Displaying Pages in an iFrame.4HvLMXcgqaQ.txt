hey this is Sasha and thanks for joining me here for another video lesson where I share with you some HTML tips to running and operating your online business end on the web now in today's video I wanted to share with you some insights on iframes iframes are not used as often or frequently regarding your website content these days as much but it's so good to know how the iframes are structured because in rare circumstances you still may want to use them so here's basically what they do is an iframe is a frame within your website so think of it like a little picture of content that you can now look at on the wall so if the whole wall is your website an iframe is a picture that now you can show other content or other data in there think of it like a video that you embed on your website from YouTube or another source so this is kind of like an iframe that really works in a similar fashion so let me share with you an example at how you can kind of use this so here if you take a look at what I've done and what I've set up here for the iframe basically the iframe code the way that it starts is it starts just show you the quick rundown here so that way later we can get into this code if you look at I frame and the iframe right there it starts out with the code being kind of like this now initially when you first start this code out you basically get a blank box because there's nothing in there so what it does is it shows external content okay so I could type in let's just say Google right here and I'll go ahead and save it if I hit refresh you'll see Google is populated in there it's a little bit small right there and what we can actually do is do with and let's just say 500 pixels and high we'll do let's just say 500 pixels and as we go ahead and now we hit refresh you can see it's kind of within my website so you'll see the URL at the top it's actually my page there that I set up but now you're viewing Google ok so as you continue to do this what you could do is go ahead and put other of content in there whether that's your other pages that you have and you slink it into there you could do it that way now I've created a quick little bit of code here that you can see there's a frame border that we named it and added an ID and if you take a look also there's the width there's the height and I've linked to my website right there so let me just get rid of this remaining code right here and just to show you what that looks like with the iframe so what you'll see is it's pulling up the backstage income website on that sides in that with at least the home page it gives you an idea of how it looks in a phone browser which there are a few issues in either case what you can actually do is since you have this kind of setup you could go ahead and add a little bit of a link which I've done there earlier at that in a few breaking spaces right there and here's a link that's outside of this iframe because the iframe the whole iframe is right there there's a few breaking spaces and there's a link and what I've done is hit the target to the ID I've matched that up so now when I click it it'll actually pull up my other website rise to learn so what we can do is let me just stop the auto refresher right here okay so you'll see the link is right here here's our iframe that's our initial page that we're displaying right there in the iframe and if I click here what you'll notice is that page the rise for learn page will load up right there right away so that's kind of how the iframe works it's great for additional content that you want to add in it could be from other pages that you have you want to pull content in there you could do it that way for me personally I like to use the PHP code and as you get more advanced you'll pull in other content like PHP include files that may be a little bit better but iframe is still one of the older ways to do this and pull in a content feed from another source so that way you're kind of looking at it from a third-party I guess so thanks for joining me in this training video I hope you found it helpful don't forget to hit the subscribe button over on this side or get on my newsletter list so that way can join me on a live class get one of my books or even see my in-depth premium courses so get on the newsletter list because that's where the action is thanks again and I hope to see you in my next training video
