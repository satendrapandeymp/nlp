when we look into attributes and one of the frequently asked question in JavaScript is difference between attribute and element property so we will look into this also difference between element property and attribute okay so let's take one example very basic HTML element I am clicking example of this button and let's say name is any value get data and type is submit okay and this is some text and end of tag I'm not talking about any JavaScript thing here okay so what is this this is just simple tag name this is name value pair this is name value pair this is takes and this is end of tag okay so this name value pair this name value pair is called attribute and again I'm not talking about JavaScript so this is just plain HTML so this name value pair is attribute this is first attribute this is the second attribute okay this is attribute name this is attribute value attribute name and value okay so now what is property if you consider this element in equivalent this element in to Dom okay javascript this is represented by one object in JavaScript okay and in this example this is instance of HTML button element okay what is this this is instance of HTML but an element class okay or in general you can say also HTML button element object okay now now since this is object okay here this is let me draw one line this is complete HTML okay no nothing to do with JavaScript this is JavaScript okay and you can see it like a mirror sort of thing okay here there are some equivalent thing you see in JavaScript Dom API okay now come to this check since this is object and every object has some properties okay properties properties and some might be methods okay these are all properties defined on this object okay these are properties and now if you look into the prototype chain of this object it's like this HTML button element object okay then we have HTML element then we have element class then node and finally object and finally null okay this is my prototype chain or you can say this chain of inheritance now come to this object again let's say these properties are inherited from your from object okay these properties are inherited from node okay node interfaces those might be methods these properties originated from element okay and these are inherited from HTML element now rest of the properties are owned property these are inherited okay one two three four and these are owned property of this object is complete equivalent object of HTML element okay and in this owned property is subset of properties represent the attribute values okay attribute values which are equivalent to this name value pair okay so what is this these are element properties and every property has name also okay so this represent okay one by one all the attributes okay for example if this element event is denoted by E we call we access any property like each dot name and this if this is this value is get data this would be get data okay so if this property is named the value is gated if this property is type the value is we we say e dot type that is equal to submit this is a string okay this is the string now now you know the difference between element okay now if I ask question that what is property value and attribute value okay now let's finish it quickly if I say what is the difference or what is property value and attribute value property value is the value at this property okay value at this property let's say this is name so value at this property of this object is property value what is attribute value this is the value that is defined in your HTML okay and same is true for another one also type also this is property value what is property name okay one important thing here the name here in our team the name is here here's name and here the name is also name but what happens if you have this class is some class value okay CSS class there should be some equivalent name or property inside this object also but it cannot be class because class is reserved word in JavaScript so there is one equivalent property for this class that is called class name I will come to the nomenclature of these things like class is represented by class name property and other thing like for for is also keyword so this is represented by HTML for name property okay okay let's do some practical example quickly this is my sample markup div one inside this div one moody is one anchor okay so okay leave it leave this anchor we are interested in this button name is get data and type is submit okay so this has tml markup this is a stable element this is attribute this is attribute okay let's open it and see the equivalent part in JavaScript okay let's grab this element mmm where it will be document taught you can grab anything but okay it's fine if I grab through div okay first I grab this step one okay and this is at steam a little bit object so we can again use mmm like last shell nice last element child okay you can also use query selector all and just by simply putting button that will return the note list object okay last element child this piece would be button okay so what is B B is HTML we can you can see the class of this one by indirectly calling to is string on the object or prototype call B what is B B is a steam button element okay so this is as jml element in your HTML and equivalent object in JavaScript is this P that is instance of HTML button element class okay now this B there are some properties defined on P if you say be taught there are so many properties defined here right so as I said there are so many properties defined some are coming from node some are coming from element some are coming from here but we are interested in own property of this HTML element and the subset of those properties are just reflecting the attribute okay that can be simply accessed like be taught name that is get data okay so this is this one is element property and this this one is attribute clear be taught you can see it type also okay now let us define one class here class is like green button we need to refresh it again okay this is just name there is no green here and do the same thing again be and now this class is this class is equal to green button this completing is attribute and there is equivalent property here that is called class name okay so remember this name and this name is not it's not always same okay yes in this case this is different this is different plus name that is green button so I hope now you are very much clear about attribute property value name and value property name property value and so so on if you have any confusion any question please ask below this video and thanks for our time thanks for watching bye
