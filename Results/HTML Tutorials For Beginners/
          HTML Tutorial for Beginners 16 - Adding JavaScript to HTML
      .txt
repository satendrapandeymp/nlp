yo people I'm sure from the nettinger and this is HTML basics lesson 15 adding JavaScript to your HTML ah so how do we have JavaScript well there's a few different ways and I'm going to give a quick overview first of all Before we jump back into the code so the first way is by using the script tags and we can place the script tags in either the head or the body and then we'd write our JavaScript code between the script tags and then when the page loads it executes the code wherever it finds it in the document the second way is by linking an external javascript file and we can do that in the head of the body also so much like we link an external stylesheet we can do that with JavaScript the third way is by inline scripting and again I'm not a big fan of this third way and much like with the CSS where we added styles to the tags themselves we can add JavaScript to the tags themselves so the reason I'm not a big fan of this is because if you've got a lot of different pages with kind of inline scripts on the tags then when you come to update your website and change these scripts or delete them it's gonna be a big big big time wasting kind of effort so for that reason not a big fan some people like doing it and I suppose if you do it in the correct way then it's fine and that's just my personal preference so what we're going to do now is jump back into the code and start adding some script to our file so here I am back in the index file and nothing has changed since the last time and we're going to start adding some scripts so the first way I mentioned was between the script tags and I said we can do this in the head or the body so we'll go ahead and put some in the head first of all so we open our script tag and we close it off and by the way in days gone by in the advent of the web site kind of technology era we used to have to specify what type of script we were going to employ and we used to do this by saying type equals JavaScript these days we don't need to do this anymore because the default script language of websites is JavaScript so by default it's going to render this as JavaScript so and let's just add a really basic kind of script and I'm going to use something that we used to always do when website first started appearing on the Internet and that's the annoying alert script so this is going to give one of those stupid little pop-ups when we load the page and I'll say yo Lingus welcome to my website and again you don't need to pay attention to the script that I'm doing that's not what I'm here to tell you I'm here to kind of explain how we add JavaScript to a webpage I'm not here to teach your JavaScript which I'll be doing in a different course entirely so we'll save that out now and I'm going to view this in a browser and there we go there is the annoying pop-up that we all hate right so as as soon as we click OK it's going to render the rest of the page so you'll notice something very important here and it didn't render the page until the JavaScript had kind of finished and we'd kind of clicked over that javascript so just bear that in mind when you're doing JavaScript now I'm going to show you what happens when we place that same script in the body tag so I'll copy and paste this and I'm going to go right down to the bottom of the body I've already put an empty placeholder script out here which I'll delete and I'll paste this script in so I'm going to save this and I'm going to view it in a browser again okay so we still get that pop-up but this time notice that in the background we've loaded that webpage and that's because the browser has encountered this script right at the bottom of the HTML document at the bottom of the body tag so it's already rendered all the rest of the web page before it's got to the JavaScript so good practice would dictate that we always put our JavaScript at the bottom of the body tag now that's not always plausible and I know there's going to be some exceptions but I'd say to begin with try to get in the habit of putting your JavaScript at the bottom of your body tag there for the rest of your page can load first of all before the JavaScript executes okay so that's the script tag the next thing we'll look at is adding an external script file so I'm going to copy this here I'm just going to cut it and I'll take out those script tags there and I'm going to save this file and the next thing I'm going to do is right-click in this left pane create a new folder called scripts and within the folder I'm going to create a new file called main JX and within this main J's file I'm just going to copy what I did in the previous example the alert here so it's exactly the same script so we'll go back to our index file now and we're going to link to this script in our head and the way we do this is by adding the script tag again and we just need to specify a source and in the same way that we specify the source in the H ref attribute here we do it in the source attribute here now it is slightly different because this is a script tag and this is a link tag and that's something you're just going to have to remember okay so we link JavaScript with the script tag and we link CSS with the link tag so within the source I'm going to find this main to make a s so the first thing we want to do is jump into the scripts directory and then put a forward slash and then click the mink gf J's file here so again we've put this in the head so the browser should encounter this script tag and load in in the head and then execute it as if the script was in the head itself so I'm going to save this file and preview it again in a browser and there we go we have the JavaScript pop-up once again coming in before the page loads and that's because again it's in the head before it's rendered the body so I'm going to click OK then it will load the rest of the page I'm going to jump back into the code and I'm going to take this script tag I'm going to pop it right at the bottom of the body just like we did with the previous example and again I'm going to right click show an explorer and preview this and now you can see that the the documents loaded with the exception of the image for some reason and I think that's just because it's taken a little longer to download the image before it's got to the script tag at but again best practice dictates that you should put your scripts maybe at the bottom of the body tag like I say not always the case there's some exceptions to this rule but as a beginner I'd always recommend popping your scripts in the bottom of your body tag okay so that's the first two methods finally we're going to have a look at some inline scripting so first of all I'm going to delete that script tag at the bottom so that doesn't interfere with anything and then what I'm going to do is pop a an inline script on this a tag right here in the navigation and I'm going to say that when someone clicks this egg link and I want the alert to come up and we do this with JavaScript events and one such event is on click so I'm saying on click of this anchor tag this anchor link and want this JavaScript to happen so I'm going to paste in not that I'm going to go to our main GS copy this and pop this back in our JavaScript here I'm just going to have to change these double quotes here two single quotes just because if you notice with the attribute here we open them with double quotes and we close them with double quotes so when it encountered a double quote here it closed the attribute for us so if I put a double quote here then the attribute is now this little bit here so I'm going to use single quotes for this JavaScript so that it doesn't interfere with our attribute so I'll save this again and view it in a browser one last time and we said that when we click one of these links I think it was the top one we should have that alert so I'll do that now and there we go it's come up with the alert and if I click OK then it's going to load the page which it links to so there are three ways of adding JavaScript to our file like say don't concentrate on the JavaScript that I've done in itself I'll do a course on that in the future but just be aware of the different ways we can add it to our web page so the takeaway from this are you can edit via the script tags in which case I'd 99 times out of 100 recommend that you put that at the bottom of your body tag we can do it via an external javascript file and link to that in the HTML document itself and again NAT nine times out of a hundred put that at the bottom of your body tag and the third way is by inline scripting which I don't really recommend but we can use it to kind of control certain events on a webpage okay so that's it for this
