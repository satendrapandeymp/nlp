[Music] [Music] hello everyone I'm exotic gaming and welcome back to another pixel gun 3d video and today's video is another special tutorial video for something that I've wanted to do a video on for a very long time now here's the thing this is something that has been going on and off in pixel gun 3d for a long time people basically having special colored names in the game and and I really knew how to do it until about two years ago when somebody showed me a specific color code in order to change your user name and then that didn't work and everybody had the same color user name and nobody knew how to change their color user name and then a friend DM me on instagram a couple of days ago and then he told me a new way to get this color coded user name in pixel gun 3d so in today's video I will be showing you all how you can get special colored user names in pixel gun 3d something I've been wanting to do for a long time and I'm finally able to show you all now I don't know if this works for Android devices I would imagine it probably does the person who showed me how to do this had an iPhone himself I'm doing this on my iPhone but I'm willing to bet it probably works for Android because it would probably work in the same type of way so if you guys are excited for this video make sure to leave a like down below and make sure to go check up the video that I posted right before this one I will link it down below at the top of the description I'm not going to tell you guys what it is but I highly recommend checking it out after you watch this one now it's a very simple process in order to changing your user name as the guys will see here if I was to just change myself to like Hello or something like that and I went into a battle into a server very quickly and changed my user name it really wouldn't be any difference it would just be the same so let's just go into any random server and then let me go chat and let me go show you guys what it looks like and my character will still have the same old yellow username just like we always do so if I say hi right now it'll be the regular green and then my characters username will be in the regulars what now we want to change that so all you're going to need to do is go look at one of the codes I have posted down below in the description I'll have a lot of them posted down below but there are even more if you go search these up online so what you're going to want to do is go over here to your little web browser and you're going to want to search color codes HTML basically for some reason the HTML color codes work with pixel gun 3d you can go to really whatever one appears first and then you will see that you can click on any of these colors here and it will give you a specific number and letter combination so this is 5 8 8 2 F a so that's a blueish color name 5 8 8 2 F a so what you're going to what to do is go 5 8 8 to F a very important what you do is you add those brackets at the very beginning and then also you add FF like I'm doing right here and then put in your username like I have right here and now it's going to say just regular exotic and if we go into a battle Nell and then we go chat we will have a blue username and it's basically that simple so let's go connect to a server very quickly just any random server doesn't really matter just showing you guys what it looks like so we're going to go into king of the hill right now let's go join it's going to take a second and as you guys will see now I have a blue username and it's that easy I'm not entirely sure if I type in high yet even if you type it will be in a different color as well I think the typing and the chat has a completely random color that is associated with the color that you chose but you guys will see now you can have different colors and you will have any specific color you want any shade any color whatever you really want you can have just search up the color code online and it's that simple you can use really whatever color you want any different seitan once as long as it shows you the HTML color codes I was using this one right here and that one looked a little bit better you can choose any color that you want so say you want to have a pink color so you go over to the pink one right here and you go click okay I actually don't know if this one works as well as the other one so let's go back to that other website let's go over to a pink color let's go get maybe this color right here that is f 8 5 8 F 4 F a 5 8 F core so F a 5/8 or F I think it's f8 for I'm assuming that's what it is F 8 5 8 F 4 nope nope and I put s 8 4 dang it's a F 4 and then let's go put the brackets again F F and then double brackets and then my name exotic and then let's go into a server very quickly and that's basically it just a little short tutorial guys thought you guys would want to see how to do this really big shout out to my friend who showed me how to do this George you know who you are and let's go into a silent school match and yes that's basically it guys I really hope you guys did enjoy this little short tutorial if you guys did make sure to leave a like down below and what a great username um but there we go yes I have a pink coloured username right now and it's that awesome so umm reason why I'm doing this tutorial I wanted to do this in a different day but I was originally planning on doing H top 10 backup video and it wasn't working at all I was not getting the greatest gameplay in the world because it seemed like every person in the entire world decided to use things like this guy using the laser minigun and other ridiculously overpowered weapons like the ghost lantern and stuff like that and in truth it was not working out all too well I was uh pretty much failing non-stop trying to get the recording of that and didn't really like it so I'm scrapping that video till a later time when I can actually have a lot more time to record and I promise you that will eventually get posted that's like one of my top priorities right now I've wanted to do the top 10 backup weapons ever since the pixel gun rants video that I posted to give you guys an idea of how long then since I've wanted to post this video and I've never had the time to do so so yeah that's that's basically it I just I really want to get that video posted I don't know if this guy knows who I am because he's using his bed bar himself but stuff yeah that's basically it guys make sure to comment down below any other cool video ideas you guys have I wanted to do a special glitch tutorial on how to get out of a specific map but for some reason it wasn't working out I'm not entirely sure why that's the case but whatever it is what it is it doesn't really matter hey you know what let's go do some gameplay here with something I don't ever really do gameplay with the infiltrator everybody's always just like exotics do some gameplay with the infiltrator so I mean you know what might as well get a couple of kills here with our little infiltrator show you guys up so more people have joined will so take this guy off this Chinese guy thinking he can take me out no no no I don't know how to say our username like doesn't really matter because you are my mom but anyways yeah definitely try this thing out guys don't know how long it's going to last um a special way of getting a special colored username in to click on 3d the best thing is if it's not like dad it's not going to screw other screw up other people's player experience it's just a harmless little cool thing that you can do for pixel gun 3d to increase your player experience it's a little it's weird because I feel like this is something that was intentionally added into the game and I feel like really soft probably would have wanted to have people do this so I'm a little surprised that they never actually you know officially showed us how to do this in pixel gun 3d but for right now um yeah that's basically it guys I just wanted to do a couple of minutes of gameplay because I know there are people that probably wanted to see a gameplay video of course today so to make it up for them I am doing a couple of minutes of gameplay here just randomly with a couple of different weapons from the backup section specifically things that I don't normally do some gameplay with like my red twins right here we probably got so it was a lot of time I use the red twins I think it was with the campaign episode number 7 which I posted like in November something like that long time ago but hey you know what red twins always a great secondary weapon a lot of fun to use the dual wielded things and they're great so I'm going to go write about I'd say I'm not going to do these video this video as long as my other ones I just want to be a couple of minutes while the red twins I mean they're they're pretty good but they're not the absolute greatest I mean either guys can see it was a lot of shots to take that person with very little armor out so on kinda underpowered but whatever it is what it is let's finish that match up and let's go you know what let's go change our username one last time I've seen other people doing this with rainbow colors and I don't know how that would exactly work because you do have a character limit when you're creating your username here if you were to keep increasing your character name as you guys will see it eventually stops at that point so I mean I'm not entirely sure how people are able to increase their character limit and do that but there may be very well a way in order to do that so hey let's go do a like a yellow or an orange character right now f-a-a c58 so let's go really quickly f-a-a c58 let's go put the FF right here very important and then put exotic there we go so let's go really quickly into a battle now thing and let's just go see if the orange works there are some color combinations that don't really work all too well so just expect maybe once in a while if you do choose a specific color it might not work but I mean as you guys can see I've tried three consecutive colors that I've never tried before in a row and they all work so the vast majority of colors that you do choose are going to work so you really don't have to worry about it on the others basically it's so thank you all for watching just absolutely destroying all of these people nice and easily that guy just resurrected I believe that one of the first time I've seen that but yeah that's basically it so thank you all for watching make
