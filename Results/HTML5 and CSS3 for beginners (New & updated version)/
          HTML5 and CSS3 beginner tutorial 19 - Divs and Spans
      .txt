hey YouTube how's it going hit screens in here and welcome to tutorial number 19 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about div and span tags and in the process we're going to talk about inline elements and block level elements and take a look at the difference between both of them so if you take a look at my text editor right now you can see that the body is blank there's no content within my body my index file right now is also blank there's nothing here and if you take a look at that in the browser of course there's nothing here as well so let's take a look at first of all the div tags I'm gonna create or open up a new tag here which is a div tag hit enter and a div tag is a block level element so let me just type block element over here and now if I put some text inside of this you'll notice that if I jump back over the browser and hit refresh it doesn't actually display or change the display of this text so maybe let me just zoom in a little bit so you can see this better but there's no styling added to the text by this div the div doesn't actually style any text inside it but what it does do is allow or give us a block that we can use to then manipulate the text and put it in certain places or move it across our page so if I jump back over to my CSS and I start styling this div tag let me give it a border of one pixel solid and red okay save this now jump back over to the browser you'll notice that this div takes up the full width or almost the full width of our page there is a little bit of spacing over here and I think that's due to the body having a little bit of padding so this this body tag obviously has some padding but one thing that is very characteristic of all block level is that if you ever give them a boarder you'll notice that the border starts and ends you know it goes all the way across the page basically so it doesn't just take up the space where the text is whereas if I were to add a span tag in here so let's create a span and well if I have enter at the right moment there it would have Auto completed it for me let's go this is a span right save this come back over to the browser hit refresh you can see that the span tag also doesn't change the display of the text in any way whatsoever so the text is not altered or the there's no styling added to the text but if I jump back over to my CSS file and I start styling the span tag let's give it a border of one pixel solid green right now you can see the difference between the two because a span tag is an inline element whereas a div tag is a block level element and you'll see that the span tag the border only goes around the text right it's only it only starts here and and yeah it doesn't stretch across the full width of the page so that means whenever you have multiple span tags let's say I have two or three of these right span tags always fit along next to each other they display in line that's where the term inline comes from whereas a block level element like this div tag if I ever had more of these they they fit underneath each other just like a paragraph does right so they'll always go one below the other even though there is actually space here div tags will not like fill up oh yeah fill up in line next to each other because they are block level elements always start on a new line right so that is the difference between a block level element or the main difference between a block level elements and an inline element right but something else that we can do to these elements is if I jump back over to my CSS I can make my div display as an inline so I if I jump back or the CSS and I just type display inline I can make my div tag display as an inline element and therefore now because my div tag and my span tag both display inline they are inline next to each other but I can also make my span tag display as a block so let's go display block and if I save this and jump back over the browser now you can see my span tag tries to fit the full width of the page whereas the div tag does not so you can change these things around you can make a div display as an inline and inline display as a block although there isn't really any need to if you just use the right element to start off with right but something I also want to show you guys is if we take away those block and inline at properties and I add another new property here let's say div and we'll give it a width of 400 pixels and a height of 600 pixels right block level elements can have widths and Heights so if I come back here and hit refresh you can now see that my div tag goes across the page until a certain point and this will probably be better to look at at the original size which is this size so that's 400 pixels across and that is 600 pixels down yeah so block level elements like this div tag can be given a width and a height although well I don't want to say although although span or inline elements cannot so if I take these same two attributes let's just copy that and paste those over there all right so if I take the same two attributes width and height and display that on a span tag if I come back here and refresh and I scroll down and look at my span tag it it didn't take that width and that height it should be the exact same size as this red block but it's not because inline elements cannot be given a width and a height they cannot be given custom with tonight's I can always change that by adding display block as a property and now my inline element as you can see displays the same size as the the red block above it maybe but just zoom out you can see that right so you always have to display an element as a block to be able to give it a custom width and height right but I'm gonna just remove those because they're not necessary and yeah just try make use of inline elements way you would use an inline elements and then make use of the div where you would want to use the block elements that way you don't have to do too much styling so let's take a look at some more examples of block level elements and inline elements so another block level element is our paragraph you'll notice that if you ever work around or play around with this this also displays as a block another inline element is actually the a tag or the anchor tag if you ever use this anywhere you'll notice that it displays as an inline element right then in future we'll be taking a look at some new tags called section so section displays as a block there's also whoopsie article tags and header tags these all display as blocks by the way another one would be footer I believe so the footer tag also displays as a block and we'll be taking a look at all of these in future and I'll explain where we would use them and why in line elements other than the span and a tag I can't really think of many off of my head but I think images as well display:inline and yeah that is all I have for you in this video and I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now why you're still here there are a few
