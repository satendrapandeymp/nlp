in this video we're going to go over how to set up a drop-down list in HTML now this is a little bit different from the checkbox we did a few videos ago a checkbox allows the user to select as many options as they want in a drop-down list you only want them to select one option so again that's what we're going to setup in this video so it is the Select element that we use to create this drop-down list and you can see it right here so we need an opening tag and we need a closing tag and then we have to use the option element and we embed that inside of our select element and we can put as many of these as we want as many options as you want to present to the user so again these go inside of our select element and again the option tags will allow us to define all the available options in this drop-down list so let's go ahead and create some options we'll just put some States in here so let's say we had some sort of travel website and let's just pretend that we have three States that we are allowing them to pick from and they can only go to one of them so the first one let's say is Michigan now this value we don't really have to worry about right now we will deal with this later on when we get to PHP and ASP but for now let's just go ahead and put in Michigan now here's where we put in the content this is what will be displayed in our drop-down list so we want to display of course Michigan and it's very appropriate to keep the value and the name the same you can do that or you can make them different so let's just go ahead and copy and paste a new item in here and let's pick another state and we'll go with Alabama about that and to complete the process let's do one more state so we'll give them three options to choose from and we'll make this North Dakota so those are the three options they get and we'll just copy and paste this in here again and let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh our HTML page and if we hit our drop-down box here you can see these are the three options that they get in our drop-down list and again they can only choose one so let's say we choose Alabama and there you can see only Alabama now shows up in the dropdownlist now again in a future video probably in the PHP or ASP series will develop a script that will actually take this and process it on a server and we'll talk about that again in a future video
