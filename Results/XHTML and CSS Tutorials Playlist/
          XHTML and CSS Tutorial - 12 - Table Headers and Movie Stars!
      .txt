well is up people how y'all doing today welcome back to you or let's see what this is 12x HTML tutorial I always go let's see what this is or what number is it i preffer should I just you know think about what number is before I start talking by no I didn't so anyways on with the tutorial in this tutorial I said we're going to be talking a little more about tables and I meant it because in this tutorial we're going to be learning about table headers now a header for your table is pretty much a title that you can put for each column so if you just have a table with a bunch of data in it people might be confused be like are these addresses or are they phone numbers are they names of people or street names I need a title to tell me what each row means or excuse me what each column means so in order to do that we need to create table headers so in order to create table headers we first need a table so let's go ahead and make a table with a border of one and put the ending table so we don't forget it later on and inside our table let's just go ahead and make a three rows so table row table row and let's go ahead and copy this actually let's go ahead and indent this make it easier to read and copy this and paste and paste so now we have a table with 3 rows in it now let's go ahead and space out these rows this is going to make it easier to read and inside the first row what we want to do is let's say we want to make a web page of the girls that I think are awesome and beautiful seems like an appropriate topic so let's go ahead and add our first header at top now in order to make a header it's th this stands for table header and these are going to be the headers for your columns so anything that you put in header is not going to be like a regular table data it's going to be bold and center so these are perfect for making the titles you're going to see later on how awesome they are so let's go ahead and make three of them we'll have three columns in this table we'll have the name of the girl and I'll write a movie that they played in I'll pick a movie stars and write the person who they love right there so I'm going to have their name a movie that they played in and someone that they love in the third column so let's go ahead and in our first row we'll make our first go girl um remember you need table data for this because this is just regular data information so let me go ahead and copy this so now we have three bits of data the first one is the name in the first girl that is awesome is Natalie Portman even though she's pretty right now best look Natalie and a movie that she played in Garden State if you guys never saw it I would highly recommend checking it out and a person that they love let's just go ahead and put Bucky because you know I'm pretty irresistible if I don't say myself so let's go ahead and take all this data copy it and put it into our next row but we can't just stress the fact how much Natalie Portman loves me because I mean we all know that so let's go ahead and pick a new girl and that would be Rachel Mick Adams and that's the girl who played in the notebook and Mean Girls um she played I think Regina in Mean Girls don't ask me how I know that just so you know just let it slide and who she loves oh yeah we'll just leave that Bucky for now so and go ahead and save that and refresh this and check it out the name this is your table header right now and you can see a table header is different because a it's centered all these are left justified and this is centered and also they're bold so they stand out so now when someone looks at this table they won't see just random information but they can see what each column means it's a lot easier to read and a lot easier to follow so yeah this actually looks like a pretty accurate table so um I'm just going to leave it like that I'm going to publish this and yeah we're good to go so anyways that's the basics of how you make a header for your table and also place it above table data and also some little insight into movie stars in who they love so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and if you have any questions go to my forum the new button comm slash forum and someone will answer for you so thank you for watching and I'll see you later
