at this point it's time to start thinking about the next step I always like to ask that question myself what is the next step in terms of my development and I recommend now that you learn jQuery jQuery is a natural extension of JavaScript it is a JavaScript framework and there are many out there today but jQuery is the most widely used and the most widely respected javascript framework so I recommend that you take that you can find that series on my channel page I will also put a link to that in the description of this video now this is not to say that I will not continue to make JavaScript videos I will javascript is simply a massive subject so I still have several other subjects that I want to talk about but at this point you can certainly go ahead and start to take the jquery course now if you have any comments or suggestions about the javascript series feel free to make them in the comment section of this video and as always thanks for watching
