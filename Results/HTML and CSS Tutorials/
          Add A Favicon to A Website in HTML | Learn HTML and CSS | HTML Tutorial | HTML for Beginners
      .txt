today we're going to learn how to insert a favicon inside our website and if you don't know what a favicon is it's basically the small icon that we see up in the tap when we view a website inside the browser so as you guys can see in my browser behind the side inside Google over here we do like to have a small icon up in the top here that shows you know two small Google logo now inside this website here that I just created which is just a basic empty template we don't have any kind of icons so inside a professional website it makes sense that we want to have the website logo or something else inside the tab so before we get started this one thing I want to do here since my monitor is quite big and the icons up here is quite small and you guys can really see what's going on in here I'm just going to go and sue mout what you guys can see here so you can see whop in the top and so you guys can actually see what's going on inside the tabs now in order to get a favicon working I went ahead and went inside my root folder of my website which is right here as you guys can see I have my index file and I created a folder called image now inside my image folder I have a image of my youtube channel logo which are designed to call that I con dot PNG well I didn't really decide to call it is I recommend you guys call it this because you need to have a separate image for your favicon now one thing to note about this image here which is of course the icon we're going to insert inside our tab is that it should not be very big now I do actually have a very big logo here because I did not prepare a small image but if you were to use a favicon you need to make sure that the icon is not a huge image that's like 500 times 500 pixels instead you should try and make it very small to save up space you know the larger the image is the more resources need to be loaded inside the website and since the favicon is going to be on every single page of your website you don't want it to be very resourceful okay so now that we have an image or at least this image view of which you guys can download in the description of this video if you want to have it just for practice and we're going to go ahead and insert it inside our website so inside my HTML document inside the head tag we're going to go ahead and include with a link so I'm just going to go and include a link tag and inside this link tag we're going to go ahead and include a rel attribute inside the rel attribute we're going to set this type of link to shortcut space icon now after the rel attribute we're going to go ahead and set a type attribute the type attribute is going to be a image /p and D and after the type we're going to go ahead and set a link to the actual image so I'm going to set a hyper reference to the folder called image we're going to dig inside of it with a forward slash and we're going to go ahead and set this one as Feb I con dot T and G so now we're actually linking to the image we can go inside our browser and as you guys can see when I do actually refresh the browser we get a favicon so this is a very simple thing to do it's not really complicated so we're not going to spend too much you know time in this episode so hope you guys enjoyed it and learn how to insert the Save icon and I'll see you guys next time
