hello guys welcome to my channel this is the seventh tutorial in this course and in this tutorial we'll be checking out the bold italic and underlined tags in HTML and as you can see I have a file opened in my text editor notepad plus plus I've give me the name tutorial - seven dot HTML and on line one in this file I have the doctype declaration and then between the HTML tags I have the head section in which I have the title of my web page which is the bold italic and underlined tags and in the body section I have three paragraphs and the first paragraph has a text this will be in bold the second paragraph has the text this will be in italic the third paragraph will have the text this will be underlined right so there are three paragraphs and let me show you guys how this page looks when I open it in Google Chrome so this is how it looks and you know it's very obvious that the style in which the text is presented in in each paragraph is different alright so the first paragraph has text or in bold the second one has text in italic and third one is text in you know in the underline mode and the way you achieve you know this is very simple I'll show you my file now and to have text in bold you have to use the B tag right that's what it's called some people call it the bold tag but you know you just have to pull in the alphabet B just as you use the alphabet P for paragraph you use the alphabet B for bold so you have the opening B tag in the closing B tag between the opening and closing P tags and this will give you the bold effect to have the italic effect you have to use the alphabet I so it's the eye tag and then do have the effect the underlined effect you have to use the alphabet you right so after the paragraph tag you have the opening unlined tag and then you have the closing online tag and the closing paragraph tag so remember that's the sequence has to be opposite so you have P as the opening tag here and you as the second tag so you have to close it in the reverse way you have to first have the closing you tag and then the closing P tag right so that's it for this tutorial and I'll see you guys next door in which we'll discuss some more HTML more tags more features and I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready and I see you soon
