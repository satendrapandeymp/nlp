hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 21 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about some child selectors in HTML and CSS so in the previous tutorial we looked at how to like identify elements more uniquely by using a class or an ID and sometimes you might want to leverage a little bit more power in CSS where you'll have a div and you might give this to a class of something like red text and you'll put a few paragraphs in here so let's just say this is a paragraph and we can duplicate that a bunch of times I'm not sure if I hit come on oh d no or come on D huh come on shifty ah there we go okay come on shift deep duplicate that line a few times and now we have paragraphs within a div that has a class of red text but we might also have a few paragraphs outside of that div right so now we can use a child selector to select only these paragraphs right so let's jump back over to the browser hit refresh let's see what this looks like so right now it's a bunch of unstyled paragraphs and I'll just zoom in make that a little bit bigger for you to see and what I'd like to do now is style those using a child selector so we know normally if we wanted to style a paragraph I might come here select that paragraph with its elements and then type in color red right but what that'll do is it'll change every single paragraph even the paragraphs outside of the div red and so let's just actually add that in here just so we can see more clearly which ones are outside the div although I mean we should all know it's the bottom three okay some save that we can see these ones that are outside of the div still display red because we've selected all of them by paragraph right but instead what we could do is come back here and look for all divs or all paragraphs within a div so let's do this I'll type in div then I'll add a space and then I'll add a paragraph tag so maybe just zoom in a little bit here about basically what this space does is tell CSS hey listen up we're looking for divs and then anything within sight inside of that div that is actually a paragraph we want to style all of those ribs so let's save here and come back and hit refresh and now you can see these three divs I think I might have zoomed in a little bit too much there but these three paragraphs that are inside of the div all got styled read whereas the three that are not inside of a div got no styling what save us they're still black right but let's say for instance I have another div on the page but this one has a different class of something like blue text and let me end that off and go ahead and copy these and paste them in here right now I've got red text which I wants to be read but I've got these ones at the bottom here which I would actually like them to be blue but because of my styling rule div space paragraph selecting all paragraphs within a div now all of these are red right so instead of selecting by element we can select by class as well so in this case I'll take any div or anything that is in a class of red text so any paragraph that has a parent with the class of red text we want to turn the right but any paragraph with a call a class of blue text let's change that blue right so let's come back yet and hit refresh and now you can see we've got red paragraphs and we've got blue paragraphs because we're using or we're selecting by class of the parents right so in this case the parents happens to be a div with a class of blue text but I could even change this div to something I don't want to say a paragraph I could change it to another element let's just call it an article maybe or a section it doesn't actually matter what element we use here because we're selecting by class so let's come back here and refresh you see we've got the same result right but in some cases you might even want to get a little bit more complicated with this or a little bit more strict with this and say hey you know what listen up I only want divs with the class of blue text to have blue paragraphs so if this is an article with blue text I don't want or an article with the class of blue text I don't want those paragraphs to to turn blue and so what you can do is specify div and then don't leave any space ha just select the class by adding that full stop and saying okay now only divs with this class or only paragraphs who have a parent of a div with the class of blue text should turn blue right let's come back here and hit refresh and you can see that now this has lost its styling because if we take a look at this again in the code this is an article with a class of blue text right so if we change this back to div and save this and come the browser and hit refresh now we've got these paragraphs displaying blue again because we're looking for paragraphs within the div that has a class of blue text so that's you know quite powerful if you think about it when you have quite a large number of elements that you want to style but you want to get really strict and you you want only one element with the class to be styled or only one element with the class that has paragraphs inside it and you only want those paragraphs to be styled and yeah I know this was a very simple example but it is a lot more powerful I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at their Mountain they run a coding
