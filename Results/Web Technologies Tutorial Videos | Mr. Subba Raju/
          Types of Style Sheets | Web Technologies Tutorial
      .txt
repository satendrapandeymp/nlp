hi guys welcome to nourish this is a barrage second video session on cascading stylesheets mechanism in this video session particular I am going to discuss with you types of style sheets how many types of style sheets available what is a meaning of style sheet in the live environment these Styles we are implementing in three ways first one is inline styles second one is internal style sheets these are popularly known as embedded style sheets third one is external style sheets maximum these three types we are implementing one by one practically I will try to show you inline Styles internal style sheets external style sheets style means collection of properties so in a sense we can apply Styles sheet level sheets level and the line level that line level is called inline style sheets if we specify the style inside a tag specific tag that to within the body part so those Styles we are calling as inline Styles vertically that inline Styles mechanism we can observe for example if you are going to practical mechanism drop type as usual standards had a section style type is equal to text or CSS paragraph and style clothes had a section closed now inside that I am using one probiotic color I said simply read come down to body area body and I said paragraph welcome to styles very simple one yesterday whatever is shown same thing I'm showing but here paragraph means I said I said already selector when we are coming to CSS syntax three parts available please refer my previous video session now I am running on my screen on any web browser now the same line I want to change as blue color not possible possible means again you need to change your blue but without changing color not possible two times below applied not like that one paragraph I want ready color one paragraph I want blue means not possible not possible in the sense I am unable to write code that is not the sense one time if you write code I want to integrate it multiple times not possible at the inline styles because inline styles are not a cascading mechanism that time better these styles we can implement like this body tag directly inside a body for example italic welcome to inline styles same example little bit differently I am showing inline styles so italic level close that same line I am duplicating right I am changing as P paragraph again this one also I am changing and be bold and this one also be bold so inline Styles Ora just run it if you need doctype you can add not compulsory better always standards LD program right doctype HTML I said I made okay good inline Styles welcome to welcome to but italic paragraph and bold though there is no style applied now I am applying for example style equal to color blue okay color blue will add 0 0 FF okay right now the same color style I want to apply here also then you need to do there is no chance of the inherit right I duplicated this color I am changing to FF only radical or I want and this color I am changing to green color right let me cut it and paste here yes now run it three three colors available you can so once opened one style is equal to color color color you need to yes after that one you need : right right separation so whenever we are writing syntax in previous video session already said color means a property : value value whatever you want you can apply right so these three inline styles available but here I declare one color here another color here another color I want to keep this color here means possible but same color you need to write without writing not possible so inline styles wherever you declared that line only affected same styles unable to apply to another line without writing those properties that is called inline Styles personality another property I'm applying for example font size font the size write a 10 pixel Iser simply write as I said you same let me duplicate 10 pixel I want to show here 20 pixel I want to show here 30 pixels and 30 pixels right go ahead now refresh perfect so 10 20 30 now this that I want to apply here without writing mix I hope you understood know correctly not possible good inline Styles applicable all tax only within the body because styles are not applicable to hide a section so second category we can see means inline style sheets after internal style sheets these are popularly known as embedded style sheets this is embedded style sheets mechanism if we specify the styles in our HTML file only that file for example I created nourish IT dot HTML one page if you are applying those files only on the page that is ITT dot HTML web page early so those Styles comes under internal or embedded style sheets these cells cannot be used in other files that means not possible to inherit to other page within the place beginning in every 10 times means I created narration - dot HTML for example knacker services dot HTML in nagger services dot HTML whatever styles available I am unable to editor it to nourish 80 if narrow say t dot HTML whatever styles available I am unable to inherit to another page again I am saying without ur writing without writing inherit possible only on that particular page right syntax very clearly mention HTML header section style type is equal to required styles you can provide and now I am showing this one by default whatever examples so far implemented all those are comes under that Styles only again I am writing HTML had a section and I am writing title doesn't require only perfect standard bone example I'm showing internal style sheets header section and body open body close HTML close inside inside observe style type is equal to always optional text or CSS it is a mind type not compulsory style now I am giving here any tag we can use write several properties any color background color one by one I'll show you first let me complete this deep within the page welcome to internal style sheets now I am running on the web page perfect now I'm applying your background color light green yes and after that one I want to apply font a size 20 bits yes i JD yes after that one font the family anyone we can apply font family good but here in this page any number of times you can duplicate no problem here you can inherit n number of times but the same one you are unable to call to another page as I said in the previous example nourish I T dot HTML knacker services dot HTML so two types of Style Sheets already shown one is inline Styles another one is internal or embedded style sheets third one important one external style sheets if you specify the Styles other than current HTML means one time if you created if you declare the Styles outside of html5 that means of other than this file then they are called external styles means CSS file we are creating separately HTML file or files we are creating separately this CSS file directly we are unable to execute on the web browser because web browser by default supports HTML as exe but CSS file save it dot CSS and try to run it you are unable to view output try that one also so that time we are integrating these two files I'm creating one small picture also for that these Styles can be reusable they can more than one file I said one CSS many HTML files may be many CSS files many HTML files the change means if you save external file dot CSS extension and if you are modifying for example one CSS file is there I attach it to for example ten HTML files if you modify in this CSS file one time how many times it is reflecting ten times obviously correct so the syntax the related syntax in the like you process environment commonly we are using external style sheets now practically before going to practical session let me show you picture wise what happening exactly here remove it and I am coming to web page on the web page I am showing for example it is one cascading style sheet file observe carefully it is dot CSS file it is a normal text file then you get it out also what is the meaning of normal text file you observed or not every CSS file writing time I am using style type is equal to text or CSS the meaning is my style sheets are equal to text type text files can we run directly on a web browser no that is a reason I wrote it is a normal text file it contains only CSS Styles no tax no in the sense not in the format of angular brackets it contains a pure English text type so ts CSS file now I am creating this as a Stepford so once step one I created I am trying to create one HTML second HTML third HTML like this like this n number of HTML how many means n number of HTML files so imagine this is a dot HTML file this is dot HTM anyone it is related to HTML or not that is important like this n number of HTML files available and here this is stepped now these HTML files are equal to exe I am showing that one two three and four all these are executable files now these executable files we can run on any web browser directly so we are running because this HT these HTML files required some colorful styles that time styles available here so these pages I am linking to here I am linking to here using which tag you are linking link tag there is a tag available link tag this link tag you want to observe means please refer my video to in HTML sessions you are getting a clear idea related to this link type so which resources I am linking to whom cascading style sheets resources I am linking to HTML file the reason it is a non executable it is the cutable directly unable to run directly can able to run now link to tag I used using this tag and we are linking CSS resource to html5 link to syntax there is no space to write I am reading out link H rough hypertext reference equal to path of the resources re l relation equal to kind of relation to the HTML file type type of the resources to the HTML so this is a link attack syntax now you linker that this one CSS file to all these HTML files now simply I am going to execute exe v z axis run on any major major web browser major web browser this is a perfect picture for you to understand in a better way external stylesheets of mechanism so if you modify one time here it is reflecting here see how many times available those many times now for better understanding I am writing another point here the point is external stylesheet these are the HTML files so this diagram practically one by one I am proving so how I am giving the resources using the link tag good I think you understood very clearly this right disappear step one I'm creating dot two CSS file right without wasting a valuable time already kept dot CSS file ready layer you only sir clearly show me any tag available here no then you should ask immediately deviis tag no tag means what where is the angular bracket now what we are calling a div tag no select our correct property value property value so perfectly there is a CSS file ready all that is saved with one dot CSS mice my style dot C as any name is a name is not material dot to see is since extinction is there or not that is a matter okay dot CSX named available now I am coming to HTML file I am writing simple code doctype HTML header section inside the head link attack H ref my file name is one dot CSS global path and arielle relation equal to style sheets because link syntax I'm talking type is equal to text or CSS completed header section close so I am calling the resources to header section we can close double quotation single quotation no problem now this is HTML file how can you say angular brackets clearly available now for example I am coming to body level and body level that the selected name I need to call what is that name div yes see how I use it no angular bracket it is attacked but it is similar I now welcome to welcome to external stylesheets do you close means select or close right so once you close it you are running so it whatever the styles it required it is importing from one dot CSS now I'm saving this one save with what extinction correct exactly dot HTML extinction once I say dot its civil extinction yes I want to run this on a neighbor browser welcome to external stylesheets come back to my CSS file and once you can modify in the CSS file what color is the green is there I want for example red the color yes ready color and modified refresh perfect so for example CSS file available another location happily right you click on the file wherever the file available go to properties copy the path put there where here put their innocence here already shown this one because local path global path root path Weber path and most important in the real-time global path no means observe immediately I will show you that one all right and one dot CSS available in my system some XYZ location imagine on the desktop available that is maybe another name no problem any name KS Raj you name available but is there any name KS Raju name available happy right so here this file available right click on that one right click properties copy the path local what I am doing copy it come to your source code and page the source backslash and I am giving KS Raju dot CSS and type I am removing you know because type is always optional attribute now once that is completed now I am coming refreshing you note put what happens flag local path some browsers supports some browsers may not support that time we are using file path efi le : triple forward slash now I am running yes perfect so this is external stylesheets of mechanism one style sheet we can attach to n number of HTML files thank you for watching my
