hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 24th we roll in this course in this year oil will be checking out how we can construct tables in our HTML web pages so the HTML file that I have here has the doctype declaration on line number one and then between the opening and closing HTML tags on lines 2 and 31 respectively I have the head section which has the opening and closing title tags and the title tags enclose the text tables in St ml and I also have the body section between the opening and closing HTML tags and the body section has opening and closing h1 heading tags on line number 7 that again you know the tags enclose the text tables in HTML and then on line number 8 I have the table element and this is the first time we're using it in this course but before I talk about rest of the elements in this file let me show you guys how this file would look if I were to open it in Google Chrome alright so this is how this file would look and you know this here is the table like we made and you know over the next few minutes we're going to talk about how we can improve it you know like have a border and you know some space between the cells and all that but you know this is a table you know a very basic table it has a country continent and capital as the headings for the three columns it has and it has four rows in total right the first row has the table headers and then there are three rows that contain data so let me go back to the file now so to have a table in you know web page you have to use a table element right so you type in table the word table between opening and closing angular brackets and there's a corresponding closing table tag online but 29 here and between the opening closing table tags you have the opening and closing TR tags for each row in your table so as I showed you guys in the in the in the fight you know when I opened the file in google chrome there are four rows in the table so there has to be four sets of TR tags and ER is a short form for table row so this is the first set and this is the second side and this is the third side and this is a fourth side right so if you want to add more rows and you'll have to you know get in another pair of opening and closing TR tags and then to have the table headers you have to use the th tag right so th is a short form for table header and it's very simple you just type in th between opening and closing angular brackets or the less than and greater than symbol and you type in your values so you know generally you would want to have table headers in the first row of the table so that's why in the first set of opening and closing TR tags I have you know three sets of th and the closing th tags so country is the first header content is the second header and capital is the third header so these are column headers for the table and then for the other rows you have to use TD as you know the sort of to have cell values in your tables so in the second row I want to have France as my value for the first column so that's why I have opening TD tag and closing TD tag here and between these two I have France and then I want to have Europe as the value for the second column so that's why opening TD tag and closing TD died here in between that I have your up source so on and so forth you know you have to just add in the opening and closing TR tags and between those you have to add an opening and closing TD tags to include the cell values now let's say you want to add a border to this table right so it's very simple all you have to do is go to your table tag on line number eight and you know just give it space after the word table and type in border right that's an attribute for the table element and then you type in the equal to symbol in between double quotes you type in the thickness for your border so let's say you want to have a border of one pixel thickness you just type in that save the file and I'll go to google chrome and I'll just refresh this and there you go you know your table now has a border and it looks good but you know as you can see the values in the first column like France India night United States of America are actually stuffed pretty much towards the left so you would want to have some space between the values and the border of the table so the way you can have that the space is by using the cell padding attribute for the table element you type in cell padding and between double quotes you type in how much space you actually want so let's say you want to have a space of five pixels so I'll type in 5px save the file and I'll go to google chrome and refresh so now you see that each value is you know sort of separated from the surrounding walls of the cells by at least five pixels right so here you have five pixels and then you have five pixels separation from the value and the you know bottle below and you know that's the case for all cells and next let's say you also want some space between the cells so you know in the third row particularly we see that it seems a little crowded because you have long values there United States of America and North America and Washington DC all long values so if you want to have space between the cells you have to use the cell spacing attribute of the table element and you again type in cell spacing C e double spacing the equal to symbol and between double quotes you type in as much space as you want so let's see one space of five pixel you type in 5px save the file and i refresh it in my browser so now I see that there is space between each cell right so that's it about the table tag in HTML and I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and there are other things that you can do with tables actually you know you can have different colors for different rows to sort of enhance the readability and the look of the table but that's kind of fancy and you know you mostly use CSS to you know deal with tables in HTML and we're going to check out how we can have different colors for different rows and maybe the next tutorial when I discuss the background color you know attribute for tags in HTML and anyway I hope you guys had fun and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I'll see you the next video till then take care
