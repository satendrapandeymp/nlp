hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 24 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about float and Kalia so if you take a look at my browser right now this is blank and that is because I've cleared everything out of my body I've also cleared everything out of my main CSS and let's take a look at how to float and clear some objects and I'm gonna be showing you guys this with an image so I've added an image to my to my directory over here you can see it with CSS the index dot HTML file and my image so that is very conveniently named me JPEG because it is a picture of me and let's add an image over here source me dot JPEG please make sure that you are using the correct file extension every time I get a comment in my HTML tutorials if I follow up with the guys it's because they're always using the wrong file extension okay and then let's add this alt attribute just because that is necessary and I'm gonna say Quinton what as the alt attribute right and then I'm going to create a paragraph so let's open up a paragraph tag and type in an and lorem and hit tab and that will generate a paragraph of lorem ipsum yeah if if you're not using sublime this is not gonna work so you're gonna have to type out a paragraph of some nonsense but let's hit save come back here and hit refresh and now you can see i've got an image appearing and then I've got my paragraph appearing below that and this is technically what you would expect to happen right you'd expect the image to appear here and in the paragraph to appear below that and this is normal document flow but let's say for instance I floated my image what that does is it pulls the image out of the normal document flow so just to demonstrate exactly what's going on here I want to create a slightly longer paragraph so I'm gonna just add in a little bit more lorem ipsum and then I'm gonna go over to my CSS file and I'm gonna select that paragraph and I just want to give it a border of 3 pixels solid and red and the reason why I'm doing that is just to show you guys what happens with the normal document flow so right now we have our paragraph and everything appears within the border of that paragraph there's no spacing there's no nothing over here and watch what happens when I float this image so let's go back to our index file I'm gonna add a class to my image and I'm just gonna call this float or you could call it float left or right whatever you want to do and I'm gonna select that image by the class so float and then I'm going to float that to the left now you can float elements any which way you want so floating to the left means that our image will be on the Left if you float to the right it means our image will be on the right so let's hit refresh and now you can see we've got our paragraph appearing to the right-hand side of our image and again you'll notice that the paragraph text is pushed all the way up against the image but one thing you'll notice is that the border of this image or the border of this paragraph is kind of missing all right and the reason for that is because that border actually goes all the way behind this image and we'll be able to see that a little bit more clearly perhaps if I stop zooming in and out and I just come back over to this image and let's give this image a width of 150 pixels and maybe make this paragraph slightly longer so where do you think I should add or make it longer from there perhaps all right so let's hit refresh and now you can see that the border of our paragraph goes all the way behind the image and basically what happened here was that this image was above the paragraph and the paragraph was below the image and then what happened was I decided to float the image and that pulled the image out of the normal document flow so pulled it ahead of the paragraph and the paragraph slipped in behind that so that's basically what happened here right and now the paragraph is behind the image but the text doesn't display behind the image so the text will always move over and give the image a little bit of space and something we could do to make this look a little bit nicer is whenever you floated your image just give it a margin to the bottom of 20 pixels or something and then give it a margin to the it depends now if if your image is floated to the left like mine is you want to give it a margin to the right of 20 pixels and now if I come back here and hit refresh you can see we've got a little bit of spacing there so that the paragraph is not pushed all the way up against the image and the only reason why I've left this border here is to show you guys that that's exactly what happens right the image was here and the paragraph now that it's floated the paragraph pulls in behind the image but if I remove that border so let's remove it you get to have something that looks a little bit more like an actual website this is what people would you how people would usually use floating right is just to pull the image to the left or to the right so let's let's float right and just show you guys what that looks like so if you look right that means I want the margin on the left of the image come back here and hit refresh and now we have our image to the right of our content so it depends it's up to you where you want to place it in fact this might look a little bit better if our paragraph was aligned to the left and I'm gonna pull that back to the left I'll place the margin back on the right again just to make it look exactly how to look before and I'm gonna make this image just a little bit bigger again so let's let's make that image 200 pixels the reason why is I want to show you guys what happens if I have a second paragraph over here so I think 200 pixels was still too small it's good 240 pixels okay just that we've got this little bit of space and the reason why I'm doing that is cuz if i duplicate this paragraph by the way all I did was hide the text in that paragraph start document looks a little bit neater but we've got these two really long paragraphs so if I save this and come back over the browser now and refresh you can see I've got paragraph 1 and then I've got paragraph 2 right and paragraph 2 because that image is so big and has floated paragraph 2 is also appearing next to the image instead of below the image and this might be a look you're going for you might decide like hey I really like this and I want to use my image or my text this way but let's just say for some reason you didn't like this and you wanted the second paragraph to absolutely no matter what display below the image right then we've got to make use of something called clear so I'm going to create a class over here called clear and then I'm going to give it and give it a property called clear and I'm gonna set that to both and the value for both just means that we're clearing items that might be floated to the left or to the right it doesn't matter which way this image is flow we're clearing both sides right so save that and then I'm going to go over to my second paragraph so not the first one but the actual second one and I'm going to give this a class of clear save this now jump back over to the browser hit refresh and now you can see what we did was we forced the second paragraph to no matter what display below the floated contents and so like I said before this we had this image over here and it was above everything and then we floated the image so everything kind of like fold in behind the gap of the image and what we did with the second paragraph was we said okay we don't want you to fill in anymore behind this image we want you to just display on a new line and so that is floating and clearing or the basics of floating and caring and there's a lot more that we can do with this and we will be looking at that in future videos so until then I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev
