hello everyone welcome to tutorial number for image mapping in HTML before starting with image mapping you know we have to learn how to create the hyperlink effect in an image when the last class we did how to create a hyperlink effect in a text now if for example if I have this image in my web page and I want that if I click on any part of this image I know google.com should open in the same tab or the next step so how to achieve that effect so it's pretty similar to what we did in the last class you have to open the anchor tag then we have to write href and then you know I want the destination which is google.com we will not put out any so this is my destination and copy the destination and I paste it over here and then I have a closing up anchor down now between this opening and closing of anchor tag I used to write some text and that takes yeah you know it became hyperlink that means that when I clicked on that text it took me to the destination website instead of writing some text I'll insert that image here so let's say and then I'll copy the destination of the image I will copy that this is the name of the image and then it's extension and now I'll save this so this is my web page so you see this is the image that I inserted in my web page now you can see that this image has been hyperlink because my cursor appears as a hand now if I move my cursor to the right part of my screen so this part of the screen is not hyperlink so if I click over here nothing happens but when I move my cursor on this image and I click on this so this takes me to Google dot hyperlink in an image ok so now moving on to image mapping so I'll give you an example to show what we can achieve with image mapping suppose I have this image with me now I wonder if I click on this part of the image it should take me to an image containing you know containing a menu about Bruce now if I click on this part of the image so it should take me to image that contains a menu about cakes similarly for this this image when I click click on this image so that you take me to a menu containing cold coffees so this is what we achieve through image mapping now for image mapping we require a few things first of all we need a suitable image now what I mean by a suitable image is that the image should have clear cut lines so this is a very good image for you know if we want to generate image mapping because in this mapping you can see all these lines they are clearly mark so you can define a hotspot around these lines so now what is a hotspot now hotspot is basically the area where you where if you click so you are taken to a different part in the same page or to a different page which happen if I have this image so I want that when I click around this cup shape show you should take me to our here menu containing hot coffee so this area will be called as a hotspot now in image mapping we have three kinds of hot spot that angular watch for circular hotspot and polygon hotspot now they are clear by as the name suggests rectangular hotspot is an in a rectangular shaped circular hotspot is in circular shape and polygon is any polygon now you know we require coordinates now for rectangular if you are using it if we are using a rectangular hotspot we need two coordinates first the top left coordinate and the bottom right coordinate and so this will cover the entire area alternatively you can also define the top right and the bottom left coordinate again for a circular coordinate I need to I need the coordinates of the center and the length of the radius so that is enough to define the circular coordinates and for a polygon hotspot I require if I have an n-sided polygon I require the coordinates of all the N edges and I have to define the one after the other now how to find if the coordinates now we can use any image editor of the simplest paint so you know you just open the image and paint now if I move my cursor to the top left part of this bruise so have my cursor over here and at the bottom left part of the screen I can see the coordinates as 189 comma 1 7 7 now if I move my cursor to the bottom right again I have the coordinates as 246 for more 260 so this is how you find the coordinates now I will show you what are the tags that we use for image mapping first of all I have to insert the image on which I want to create an image match so again I'll use this image source and then I'll be using this image to create an image map so I'll go to each properties and I'll copy the destination followed by the name of the image and the extension and close it now I have this image in my web page so now I want to start with the image mapping so I'll just use the center tag so that this image appears in the center of my screen and then I'll just close the center to this now I want my I want to tell my browser that I am actually creating an image image mapping in this image so I have a attribute called use map and then I have to define a name for that month so you know you can again you can define any name like I'll choose menu as my name so okay I have inserted I have inserted the image and I've also told my browser that I'm actually creating an image map in this image so I'll use this attribute code you slap now I will open this open this map so this is the tag that is used and then I'll do and write the name of the map that I defined idea which was many so while defining we are using the hashtag and while opening we are not using hashtag this is something that we have done earlier also so now and then I open this map now now I have to define the area of the shape of the hotspot and the coordinate so this is the tax that I use a Liam shaped equals to now I am using a rectangular hotspot so I will write direct in if I am using a circular hot spot on that circular and if I am using a polygon watch what I will just write Bondi and then I have to define the coordinate so now I open this image and paint again the top-left corner the coordinates are let's say 1 9 1 comma 1 7 7 so I'll simply write simply write them separated by commas now the coordinates of the bottom left bottom right sorry is natural to 45 comma 260 so again I just have to separate them by commas now now I have put it when define the href and I'll just write a name let's say Bruce so I have this I've defined the shape of the hotspot and the coordinates of the hotspot and have also defined a name for the edge now I have to define not to define that where should this this where should this coordinate when I click on these coordinates where should my browser take me so for that let's say I have this I already have this image so this is a menu about Bruce so I want that when I click on this part of the image it should take me to this brings menu so this is how I'll do it again for that I have to insert this image in my web page so you know on I just use few brake lines over here and let's say I'll define a header as and now I am inserting the image as the image was in the same directory as I can simply copy this and instead of main menu the name of the image was blue so I'm naming it it as now under I have inserted this image in my web page now before this bruise I will I will open the anchor which I defined earlier now the name of the anchor was Cruz so I'll just write through this before this it may sound a little confusing but you know once I show you the effect you know it will be very clear so now again going back I'll just explain quickly what I have done I have first of all I have inserted my main image and then I have defined that I am creating an image lap in this case then I open that image map then I have defined the shape of the hotspot the coordinates of the hotspot that I will be using and I also define the answer now I want this anchor to take me to you know just before this job open the anchor so I want this angle to be equal to Bruges and I'll use another break line over here and then I'll show you the effect I'll save it now I have this image mapping the way you can see in any other part of the image my cursor it appears as a normal question but when I take it when I can you know when when I take my cursor over this blue section so it changes into a hand that means that this part of the image has been hyperlink and this has been linked to this text so I'll show you what happens when I click on this image so you see it takes me to this text and because I position this text just before the image so consequently I am also getting that image now if I wanted I could have removed this bruise you know this text has bring is also an in place of this bruise I I'll just show you in place of these tools I'll place this bruise with the image you know we have witnessed this in the beginning of of our class you know we can also hyperlink an image instead of instead of vertex so again I will save it and refresh it so when I click on this it again takes me to the it again takes me to the grooves bit so this is done now again I there was like me just by name main image now I need the coordinates of all these all these small images so I already have the bondage so I'll just copy them and okay I'll copy and paste them so I again I'll tell you what are the things that I've pasted now this is something that we already did we define the coordinates for the proofs now I have defined the coordinates for cone coffee again the coordinates for snacks cakes and likewise the bondage for shakes now I have I've inserted the image of grooves and I also have created an anchor just before this heading rules now again I open the anchor bolt coal coking you see I've defined the anchor code coffee over here now I've opened the anchor code coffee and I have the image corresponding to coal both a similarly of the anchor for snacks and after coordinate for snacks and down here I have the image for snacks and just before this define the anchor so and similarly for cakes and shakes and at the end you have to close the novel so this is again so I'll save it and refresh it now you see when I click on throughs it takes me to Bruce I'll use more great line tags this is AG you okay so now I'm done with all the formatting now when I click on this bruise it takes me to a menu containing proves again when I click on kake it takes me to a menu containing cakes now if I click on this cold coffee so it takes me to the whole coffee section if I want four shakes ok I am NOT getting the image four shakes if I want the snacks I am getting the image for slacks so this is how we create image mapping using an image and this is all in this tutorial and you can again we can subscribe to my channel I'll be posting more tutorials and thanks again
