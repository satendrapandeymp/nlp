sometimes we need to quote somebody whether it's a book passage or something somebody said on a different blog there's a lot of different uses think of it just when writing a normal article with pen and paper there are some times when you need to quote somebody and we can do that within HTML as well by using what's known as the block quote element now within here this is a way to tell the browser anything within here is a quote so why don't we reference an Einstein quote I pulled up a list of some of his quotes let's just get one of these so within here it is a paragraph so I'm going to make sure that I add a P tag paste it in and close out my paragraph as well and remember what we learned about indentation it's a good practice make sure we indent so it's easy to tell that this paragraph is a child of the block quote good so let's save that and view it in the browser so if I view it it may not look like anything special to you and that's okay because remember if you were expecting maybe big shiny quotation marks or at least the text to be italic that's not what markup is about markup does not specify formatting or font weight or font style it's simply to describe your content and that's something you always need to remember so you might be thinking well why would I ever use that it's just it's easy to do this I get the same effect and it's less markup and it's because we are describing our content and that is equally important whether it be for screen readers or for future proofing our markup so let's save that and if I view the source once again you can go to view developer source or I always press control/command you on the Mac and now we have given the browser some understanding as to what this specific content is so just remember if you're writing a blog posting if you're doing a website anytime you need to provide a call-out and it's again a nice way when creating blog postings to divide your content once again if we refer to net touch you can see that we use block quotes like so let's check it out inspect element and once again you can see that it is wrapped within a blockquote and within here we have our quote and then we're using styling or cascading style sheets to make the text italic to add a quotation mark here to make it look like a quote but the mark-up alone is simply a block quote with the paragraph tag in it
