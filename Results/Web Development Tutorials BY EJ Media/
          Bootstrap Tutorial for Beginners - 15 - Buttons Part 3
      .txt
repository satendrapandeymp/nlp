in this video we're going to take a look at how to create toolbars in bootstrap now in the last video of course we created these button groups and basically what a toolbar is that it allows you to combine multiple groups together into one unified toolbar so again that is what we're going to do in this video so let's go ahead and we're going to go ahead and take this group right here that we created in the last video we're just going to copy this we're going to go down here and we're going to go ahead and paste that right here and so this will be our first button group then what we're going to do is all of our buttons are actually going to be primary buttons and this works better if you have a bunch of buttons that are similar in this case we're just going to number the buttons and you'll see how this looks in the end so we're going to make these all primary buttons and then what we're going to do is we're just going to call this one the first one and we're going to call this one two and we're going to call this one three and for good measure let's add two more buttons to our toolbar and those will be four and five so let's just go ahead and copy and paste this here and then we'll add these other numbers good now what we want to do is take this remember I said you're actually combining multiple groups to create your toolbar so we're going to create a second group here so we'll copy and paste the one we just did and let's just copy and paste this right below so there we go now let's go ahead and we'll call this button six because remember this is all part of the same toolbar this will be seven this will be eight and this will be nine let's not worry about a tenth button we'll just go with nine buttons that's good there we go so now we've got our two groups right there now what we need to do is unify all these into our toolbar and so what we're going to do is create another div to wrap both of these groups inside that div so let's go ahead and do that and of course we just specify div here and the class that we're going to call is another bootstrap class and you won't be surprised by what the name is it is the toolbar class and so we just specify BTN - toolbar that's what we do and so there we go we've got our toolbar class now in this case we set the role to toolbar you remember in the button groups that's a group but in this case we'll set the role now to toolbar to identify this as a toolbar there we go now let's go ahead and we're going to give this an ID because we want to create some margin for this because we've been doing that in the previous videos we've been given everything a margin of five pixels so we'll give our toolbar also a margin of five pixels and we're just going to give this an ID and let's just call this test one there we go and then let's go ahead and close our div out down here and now we've got both of our groups now wrapped with inside of our toolbar and this should create a nice toolbar effect but before we do that let's go over to our style sheet and let's go ahead and add that ID that we created just copy and paste this div one here and we're just going to say pound test one for the ID that we created good all right so let's save this and let's go back to our HTML document let's save that and let's go ahead now and open this up in chrome and see what we get there you can see we've got this nice toolbar take a look at how nice that looks and again this works well if you're using very similar buttons as you can see here so again this is how you can combine multiple button groups into one toolbar okay we'll move on to drop-down menus in the next lecture see you guys
