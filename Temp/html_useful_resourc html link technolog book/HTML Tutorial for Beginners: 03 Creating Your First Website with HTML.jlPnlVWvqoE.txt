hey this is Sasha and welcome back today I want to share with you how to create your first website and just show you the construction of it not going to be too difficult you'll see we'll run through this fairly quickly I'll just show you the basic fundamentals behind it and what creates the website so let's take a look at some code and then look at our browser and see how this really applies to creating our first page all right so you see I have a basic sublime text notepad file here open and the way that you write out the code or at least initially in order to start out your website is it's going to start with this HTML kind of a bracket so you'll notice that what I have is a plug-in by sublime text is called emmett and you can install that through your package controls but if you hit tab it will actually automatically fill these things in to set up a basic HTML document so let's run through what each of these things do because this is kind of the core or the baseline to writing an HTML document so typically what you'll notice is right here at the top this defines the type of document that it is it is the HTML document okay then what we'll have is these two brackets that are HTML and you have the opening and you have the closing bracket okay you'll notice that by the slash right there okay so the only dot area here as you can see that does not have a closing bracket is this document type that's defined everything else is going to have one of these closing and brackets okay so the next one that we have if you take a look at it and I'm going to just highlight it you can see we have a head tag ok so the head tag again it starts right here and ends right there now inside of that head tag we also have a title tag this is called nesting and we'll talk about that later basically it's a tag within attack but we have a head tag right here and then we also have the body tag okay now the body tag is to be your main area where you're going to do ninety percent of your HTML work probably ninety five percent there are some things that go in the head tag but other than that most of it would go in the body pack so that's what we're going to do is we're going to work right there in that body tag in that area that's our core is this body tag area and the great thing with HTML is you can add a lot of additional spaces here and it won't count those because it's reading the tags it's reading what's out there so all these empty lines and empty spaces you don't even have to worry about them so if you want to make things easier you could go ahead and add a few lines here if you want to indent them with sublime text I can highlight them and invent them and that way I can see he and make things a little more organized and that's why you'll see this title tag also slightly indented so again if we break things apart there's your HTML okay with in that I'm going to go ahead and do my heading tag or a head tag then in here i have my body tag okay so there it is and I add some spaces right there so those are my tags if I want to make them a little more readable there we go that's our baseline for the website now in order for me to save this all I need to do is go to file save as pretty simple process and now I'll go ahead and pick my location or directory now for me it's going to be we'll do it in our HTML training I'll just save it as my page 01 okay we'll just go this route that way we can reference back other pages I'm going to add the extension dot HTML on here and then we'll go ahead and hit save now if I go on to my desktop right here and i go to HTML training there is my page i can simply double-click and open it up and as i look into my other browser and pop that up for you can see it takes me right there my page dot 1 there's my directory my location you can see it right there you don't really see anything on the page because there's nothing there okay if I right click and I view page source you'll see my page is basically empty if i zoom in but it's written exactly the way that I did it with the spacings and so on and so forth so I'll leave the screen up so that way I can refresh it from time to time as we go back into it if I go ahead and pull back my file right here what i could do is go ahead and add a title tag okay so this is the title tag that we had in the past i'll just type that in hit tab button it'll expand it so i could say my cooking website now that i have the title in there i can go ahead and hit ctrl f or save it one more time and as i go back and look at this page you'll see nothing has changed yet and you can see at the very top also right there it says my page 01 so this is what the title really controls and you can see there's no title yet right here so if I go right here and click the other tab this is the empty page if I hit f5 you can see what happened right there my cooking website it changed that tab to my cooking website and if I go back to the HTML and I had f5 you can see that code was also added in so you can see how this works out real well that when you're working with multiple monitors you're able to flip back and forth very quickly so as we go back into our document if we want to go ahead and now start adding and typing in some text I'm just going to you could just type in some text I have a little quick program that you know expands my text for me and i'll just write in some dummy text right there so after i wrote in some dummy text i can go ahead and hit ctrl s and save it again as i go back into the page you'll see nothing has changed yet if i hit f5 and refresh you'll see there is my page there's the text that i wrote in if i go back to the code f5 you can see there is the code there's the text that i put in so you can see that's basically our first website you can see you don't need a lot of tools to be able to test things all you need is a browser and just a basic notepad file because your browser itself is going to read these files for you and process them and read them for you and output a look whether that's a basic look right here where are you just seeing the text if you want to view the source you know right click and view page source which is what we're doing right here you'll be able to see it right there or if you're reading the code eventually as you get better you'll simply read the code and you'll understand kind of what the website will look like so with time and with practice you'll continue to get better and better and ultimately will continue to evolve your skills but that's basically your first website from saving the file right there now one last point it's important to remember is that when you're uploading files to your web server what you want to remember is that the primary name that you want for your homepage you don't want it just my page hyphen o one you want index dot HTML and that'll be your w your domain com and that's what it'll be it could be index dot HTM or you could make it dot HTML typically be consistent as you give into more advanced pages it might be dot PHP as you get into PHP based coding and things of that nature but in either case for our examples you would write dot HTML so that way that would be your homepage but in our case I just named it my page hyphen o 1 dot HTML so that way we can keep consistent as we go through the lessons thanks for joining me in this lesson I hope you really enjoyed it and found it helpful to getting your first website up continue watching some of the next training videos because that's where we start getting into more detailed HTML but if you want to see some of my business training videos or get exclusive video content on business training go ahead hit the button right here sign up to my newsletter list
