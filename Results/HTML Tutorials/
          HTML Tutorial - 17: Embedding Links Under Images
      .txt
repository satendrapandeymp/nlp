hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 73 total in this course in this tutorial we're gonna continue our discussion on links and check out how we can embed links behind images in our webpages so in this document on line number one i have the doctype declaration and between the opening and closing HTML tags i have the head section which has the you know opening and closing title tags and the title of this page is all about links part 3 this is the third tutorial on links in this course and then in the body section I have you know the center tag and the h1 heading tag and the heading of the page is the Tennis Center and I've closed the heading tag in the center tag in the set sequence and then I also have the IMG tag here and I have included you know the image tennis dot jpg that's the name of the file and I've set the height of the image to 80% of the original height and the width to 100% of the original height and I've closed the image tag and you know I have also you know wrapped around this image tag the anchor tag and you know the value that I have associated with the href attribute is the URL WWWE P world.com and now let me show you guys this file in Google Chrome so this is how it looks and you know this must be familiar because the tutorial that we had on images in that it'll be made you know a similar webpage I guess it was exactly the same in fact we know we had the same heading same font style same font size everything was the same and we even used the same image right and the only difference between that file in this file is that in this file if I would click on any space on the image I would be taken to www.google.com as I I just did that and here it is you know I've been taken to a TV Volcom so this is how you insert or embed links over images in HTML and it's actually pretty simple and again you know something that's widely used you have your Desmond's and you know so many other things on websites when you click on those images you are taken to you know the websites of the windows and that's it for now I'll see you guys in the next tutorial in which we'll discuss some more interesting features of HTML I hope you guys had fun I assume the next video you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and see you soon till then take care
