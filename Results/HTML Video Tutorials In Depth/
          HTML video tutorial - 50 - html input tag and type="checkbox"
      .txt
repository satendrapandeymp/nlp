hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page by right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in the previous tutorial we understood how we can create radio buttons and how we can group radio buttons to get the proper behavior we also understood how we can create password fields how we can create text boxes in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML check boxes are check box control how we create check boxes when we need to create check boxes answer to the second question when we need to create check boxes if we want to get more than one values our list of values are if we want to allow users to make more than 1 selections then we create check boxes for example in an application form if we want to get list of software skills of an applicant like C C++ Java C sharp there will be many options right and one applicant might know C C++ Java other might know HTML CSS JavaScript on some other applicant might know C++ CSS JavaScript in that situation to get list of skills and allow user to make more than one selections we create check boxes let's take one more example if we want to get hobbies of an applicant like playing cricket listening to music drawing there will be many options again one applicant might be having a hobby of playing cricket and other may be having listening to music and drawing or one more person or applicant might have a hobby of playing cricket listening to music as well as drawing to get list of hobbies or allowed the applicant to select more than one hobbies in that situation we are going to create checkboxes now we are going to get answer to the first question that is how we create checkboxes let's see practically here I am going to put break tag BR then I use paragraph then I say here software skills s ki ll s closing paragraph control s I go to browser and say refresh you can see that software skills got displayed I put : here then to create a check box also we are going to use input tag I n P UT input type the value we are going to give is CH e ck Bevo x check box for our slash greater than file save go to browser refresh you can see that browser is displaying it check box and also you can see I should tell for what this check box is meant just in front of this I am going to put a text so that user can identify or understand this check box is meant for something some specific thing like I am going to say here see file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have C takes displayed just beside the check box then I have to give name I can give a name also later similarly I want one more check box to get one more check box I am going to copy this then I paste it then I say here C++ file save go to browser refresh you can see that one more check box got displayed I can add more check boxes let's take I say here check box for Java file save go to browser refresh c c++ java 3 check box has got displayed properly next thing i need to give a name properly to give a name i am going to use the name attribute and i give a value as CH k that indicates checkbox CH k I am using prefix then I say here soft skills actually I can write here software skills that will give more meaning then I hit enter I copy this name and paste it here similarly I hit enter I give the name to this also same can see here I grouped all the checkboxes by giving same value to the name attribute in all the checkboxes file save go to browser refresh ok you can see when I load the browser if i refresh all checkboxes are d selected they are not checked I can put by default one checkbox is checked by using the attribute called as check here I'm going to say CH e cked check the attribute I am using file save go to browser and say refresh you can see that C check box is now checked by default I have checked this checkbox similarly I can give value to each checkbox for this I am going to use the value C for this I am going to give value as cpp for this I am going to give VA lue value as j.j for Java you can see that we have given different values file save go to browser refresh no problem when I access this checkbox group this name chk software skills if C check box is selected c++ check box is selected then in the code I am going to get array of values separated by comma I will get C comma CPP if a person selected Java checkbox and C++ checkbox when I access chk software skills in JavaScript code or some other code then I will get array of CPP and Java that is I am going to get CPP comma J return in the code I can access these controls very easily by using the name or I can use the ID also hope you guys have understood how we can create check boxes and also you can see that I can select or deselect the check box I can select more than one check boxes or I can check more than one checkboxes right this is how the checkboxes behave guys for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
