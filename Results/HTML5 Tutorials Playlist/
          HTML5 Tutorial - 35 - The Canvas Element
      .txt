what's going on guys welcome to another amazing tutorial and in this lesson I want to start talking to you guys about the canvas in html5 now what the canvas is is it's a very powerful feature that basically allows us to draw graphics on our web page and I'm not just talking about JPEG or ping images that we can embed on there I'm talking about a drawing program just like you would draw graphics in Photoshop we can actually use that same technology but in our web pages now to make dynamic moving changing graphics and it's going to be awesome so the first thing I want to mention is this in order to use the canvas feature you actually need a JavaScript file the JavaScript is basically going to be the brains behind drawing everything the HTML is pretty much just going to be the display what you look at so let's go ahead and a link to our JavaScript file now and I'm gonna do that source equal Bucky Jas and I recommend that you name yours Bucky js2 why because it's my name and it's awesome so go ahead and link to it right there and now let's actually go ahead and make the canvas itself so I'm actually gonna put this in a section and I'll just give it an ID of main and this is just because I like organizing everything very nicely and insider section is the canvas itself so in order to make a canvas on your HTML file what you need to do is first make the canvas open and closing tags then of course the tag name is canvas if you kind of guessed and the opening canvas tag takes a couple attributes that are actually necessary the first thing we need to do is we need to give it an ID so let me go ahead and just give this an ID of canvas now why do we need to give an ID well whenever we are referencing this canvas in JavaScript say we have five different canvases on our web page well we want to say that we want to work with this canvas so in order to say alright this is the canvas we want to work with we reference it through ID actually through the JavaScript method get element by ID I don't know if you guys remember that you'll see later on and now after this it takes two more necessary attributes width and you guys can probably guess height so this is basically how wide and how tall of an area do you want to be able to draw graphics on so depending on your website depending on what you're developing for this may be a little bit different but for me for this tutorial I'm just gonna make mine 600 by 400 and what this is is it's basically like a blank piece of paper on your website and in this area is the only area that you're going to be able to draw on so if you didn't have this at all like this you wouldn't just be able to draw graphics are you here you actually need a canvas and set the width and height of it before you can draw so before we start typing and drawing you know a whole bunch of shapes in gradients and you know colors on this canvas we need to do something for the people that don't have Google chromia before you know your grandma who just got the internet like 10 years ago and has upgraded their browser let me go ahead and write like hopefully you don't see this if you do get Google Chrome so why would I write an awful mean message like that well as you guys probably could have guessed what the canvas does is like I said it's basically a blank piece of paper that shows up on your website that you can draw graphics on now for those people who have not upgraded their browser in like the last three years and are working with like you know an old Internet Explorer 6 what they do is that browser doesn't have the capability to you know see the canvas yet it doesn't even know about it so whenever someone with the old browser tries to see a webpage with a canvas on it and they can't because the browser just is incapable they're gonna get this message instead so if we go ahead and save this and run in launching Chrome I have updated browser that is you know capable of all the html5 features so I don't see that you know error message at all I just see this canvas that's ready to be drawn on however like I said not everyone can see this if they don't then you're going to give this error message so if you're watching this tutorial and you're like no I wonder if my browser can see there sometime just go ahead and throw this in and hopefully you don't see this so now before we start drawing crap I want to mention one last thing you know how this has a width of 604 well let me go ahead and mention this what the canvas is is it's basically a bunch of coordinates or a grid system now in this canvas 0 0 is in the top left so don't think of this like in math class while you're making quadrant 1 2 3 4 and 0 zero was in the middle not this case 0 0 is in the top left so if I say okay we're gonna start drawing at the coordinate 100 100 it would mean 100 across and 100 pixels down so 100 100 would be right around here and that's where we tell the canvas where we want to start making those shapes so that is all I'm gonna cover for this tutorial again make sure your HTML file is set up and in the next surah what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be hopping over to this javascript file and actually showing you guys how to make different kinds of shapes how to make different sizes and a whole bunch of awesome stuff so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys then
