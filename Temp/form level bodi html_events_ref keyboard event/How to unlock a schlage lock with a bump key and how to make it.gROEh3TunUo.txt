all right today's lock-picking lesson guys this is going to be on bump key how to open a lock with a bump key so first I want to explain you guys really quick what a lock looks like on the inside so right here this is your key okay be a standard key these are your called your bottom pins and these are your top pins okay so win your top pins and your bottom pins getting this orientation as they are right now this right here is called your shear line okay so when you put a key in they get that's the right key they they make this shear line like this and then you can actually turn the key over here and a lock will open okay with the key out these Springs push these down and then your shear line is blocked by the pins and that is how it's locked so without the right key you can't create the shear line and turn the lock so that's a basic lesson on a lock now let me get into what bump keying is so pacifically what what the keys look like see if I can show you guys here if you can make it out okay so you can see this is a key this is a normal key and then I'm going to show you one to compare it to so you can see the other one this is a bump key okay the normal key has got normal cuts in it and a normal tip and a normal shoulder right here and on the bottom of normal shoulder alright the bump key has a sanded down tip sanded shoulder and sanded top shoulder and then all of the cuts in it as you can see are very very deep instead of being you know jagged up down up down these are all sanded or filed down to the deepest cut and this is for a Schlage lock so I think those cuts are a number called number nines on Asha leg maybe sixes I don't remember I get quick settings like confused sometimes so you got to on a key if you have a standard key like this one above is sand off the tip sand the shoulder back a little bit maybe an eighth of an inch and 1/8 inch off the tip and then sand down or file down all of your grooves all the way down till they hit that line which is the deepest cut you could possibly have and that this is a standard key and that right there is a bump key so now let me get my lock out and show you how this actually works is pretty neat I want to pause you can get a better view of this alright here's my lock so as you can see here I'm going to turn this so you can see it will not unlock it's locked back here on this little sucker so you're going to do is you take your bump key and you're going to sit it inside the lock and you want to actually push all the way and then let it pull back just a hair okay then you want to hold the lock like this and get a screwdriver like this one and whack the key normally takes a couple whacks right there it goes now you see a turn all right now I actually locked the good lock again I turned it the wrong direction but let's do it again push pressure on this side and cut it a couple times and there you go now the lock turns there it is the lock is now unlocked now this will work on any kind of Schlage lock any lock this kind of key would actually fit in and that's it man you just hear will relock it so I can show you again taking it up turn that it's locked stick your lock in kind of pull it back just to here and then we got to push it the right direction this time sometimes you got to pull it out just a hair to hit it again sometimes you'll get in like the first couple hits times it might take a couple of them but this if I got it again there it goes so it turned it again and there it is this will work on Schlage door knobs dead bolts anything that easy why mess with picking a lock when you can bump it so check it out sometime give it a try yourself it's really cool play with your own locks at your house real easy these cuts on this thing don't have to be exact when you bring this back up so you can get a better backdrop here the cuts on this key don't have to be exact right on here I filed them all down with a file if you get them close you're good enough the key is softer than the pins inside the lock these pins up here so the key will actually mold a little bit if your filings aren't like perfectly lined up nice so there it is guys that's that's how you do it that's how to make a bump key that's how to bump a lock really easy get in a nice leg lock you can make a quick set bump key the same way go ahead and have some fun with it check it out thanks for watching and as always you can just subscribe down the bottom corner right down bar and see what other videos I got out there thanks
