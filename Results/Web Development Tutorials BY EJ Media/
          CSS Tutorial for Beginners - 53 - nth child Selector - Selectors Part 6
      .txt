we are going to look at the enth child selector in this video now the end child selector is a type of pseudo selector you will remember a while ago we talked about the hover effect and that is also a type of pseudo selector and so is the nth child selector now every pseudo selector starts out with a colon and so the enth starts out with a colon as well which again identifies it as a pseudo selector now we use the nth child for pattern selections so maybe you want to select every even or odd numbered element and that's what we are going to start out first with selecting odd or even numbered elements so you can see here I've created all of these paragraphs because I want a lot of paragraphs to establish pattern and right here we're going to select our div which of course is as an ID of right so we'll select that and then we'll point to our paragraphs that's what we want to target so all of our paragraphs inside of our right div and then of course we use the colon right here and this kicks off our pseudo selector and here of course we put nth child now we put arguments into these open parentheses right here so the first thing we want to do is select all of the even-numbered elements so all you do is just use the keyword even very simple so let's just go ahead and save this and so now if this works all the even-numbered elements should be selected so let's refresh our page and you can see they are so we have the second one the fourth one the sixth the eighth and so on now the opposite is the odd keyword and you guessed it that will do all of the odd numbered paragraph elements so let's refresh our page and there you can see now we start out with the first because that is an odd number three five and so on now you can also just put a straight number in here let's say you just wanted to select a third element well you can do that and we'll go ahead and refresh our page and there you can see you get just the third element selected but that's not a pattern is it so if you want that to be a pattern you put the letter and after it and that will tell it to create a pattern so if we refresh our page there you can see now we get every third element selected now what if we wanted to do a little bit more of a complicated pattern we can do that by adding a plus sign and what you can do here is you can started out at a specific point so let's say we still want to go ahead and repeat this every three but we want to start it out at a very specific point so again you put in the plus sign and then you put in where you want this to start out at so let's say we want to start out at the fourth position instead of the third position and then after that we want to repeat three again so we'll put in four right here and we'll go ahead and save this so once again if this works we'll start out at the fourth paragraph element and then we'll repeat every three elements so let's refresh our page and there you can see it did it look we started out at the fourth paragraph this time and then we repeated every three let's go ahead and switch this to two now see what happens now it should be every two paragraphs after we start out with the fourth paragraph so let's refresh this whoops I did that wrong not 32 - okay that's why I didn't say anything let's go ahead and refresh this and there you can see we select every second paragraph after starting out with the fourth paragraph so that's how the enth selector works I will see you guys in the next video
