hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we have understood how to use html5 video tag to embed a video in a webpage we can use the video tag or embed tag the browsers that support video tag will play the source video provided in the video tag and the browsers that don't support the video tag will play the source video provided in embed tag videos that are embedded by using the embed tag are played by installed player plugins whereas videos that are embedded by using the video tag are played by the browser themselves if we embed a video by using the embed tag then user need to depend on the plugins if player plug-in is not available or installed then video don't get play user need to install or enable the plug-in to play the video if we embed a video by using the video tag then user need not to depend on any player plugins because browsers will play the video themselves both video and embed tag have the SRC attribute which except the source video file to be played to control whether the video should get play automatically or not video tag uses autoplay attribute embed tag uses auto start attribute to display the controls in video tag we use controls attribute whereas embed tag automatically adds the controls below the video in this video tutorial we are going to discuss some more attributes of video tag so first thing you can see in the firefox this is how we get the output and in the Internet Explorer this is how we get the output of the code that we have written we can set the width and height of the videos first thing I go to embed tag and set here width equal to 300 pixels heig SD height equal to 200 pixels I save file save go to Internet Explorer and refresh you can see the video width and height got reduced if I go to Firefox and refresh nothing happens because I have to set the width equal to 300 heig SD height equal to 200 in the video tag so we your tag has the width and height attribute also file/save go to browser and refresh you can see the width and height of the video got reduced this is how you can set the width and height of a video by using the width and height attribute and one more thing is if I play the video let me go to Firefox and play the video you can see the video is getting played I go to end of the video you can see the video is getting played once the video got played at the end video gets stopped it won't look back if you want to loop the video back or you can play again and again repeatedly then you need to loop the video right to loop a video you have to use the loop attribute in video tag for example let's see file save go to Firefox and refresh the video or refresh the HTML page and play the video you can see video is getting played I go to end video ends and gets replay back you can see that I go to end of the video again video ends and replays back so that is the loop attribute operation so loop attribute loops the video similarly in embed tag what we have to do is we have to use the loop attribute and we should set true or false values so here I say true true means the video should loop file save go to Internet Explorer refresh the video and play the video you can see video is getting played I go to end of the video video ends and gets replay I go to end video ends and the getting replay that is how you can loop the video by using the loop attribute in embed tag and in video tag I hope you guys have understood how do you loop the video file save go to Firefox refresh go to Internet Explorer and refresh one more thing we can do is you can see here the video control here that we see is displaying the first frame of the video which is completely black screen right instead of that we can display one of the frame of the video or we can display one image here or we can say we can set a thumb image or we can set a poster to the video to do that you can see what I have done is I have taken a screen shot let me right click on it and say pre we've taken screenshot or a snapshot of one frame of the video I can apply this image as a thumbnail to the video or as a poster to the video how do we do that means we can go to the video tab here we use poster attribute and to the poster we have to give the image file I am going to copy this name and paste here dot PNG is the file format I am giving the image file here file save go to Firefox now this time if i refresh you will see that image in this place as a poster or a thumbnail if i refresh you can see i have that image displayed then once i click off on the play button video will get start playing hope you guys have understood how do you set the thumbnail image or poster image to the video by using the poster attribute of a video tag we don't have any such attribute with respect to the embed tag to display a image on the video or a poster on the video we can use some CSS techniques to display some image so hope you guys have understood different attributes with respect to the video tag and embed tag how do we control the videos remember that SRC attribute accepts the source video to be played and controls attribute adds controls or video controls to the video loop attribute is going to loop the video width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video poster attribute is used to set the poster to the video and autoplay attribute is used to control whether the video should get automatically play are the video should get play only when the user clicks on the play button so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next
