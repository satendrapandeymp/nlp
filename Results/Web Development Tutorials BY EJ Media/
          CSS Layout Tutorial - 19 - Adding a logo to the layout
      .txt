so I've had a lot of requests from people on how to add a logo to the header section in their HTML document and if I get enough questions I guess it's time to do a video on it so that's what we're going to do in this video now we're going to use the fixed layout that we've used in the last several videos but you could use this for the fluid layout that we did earlier you could use this procedure in any type of layout that you want so first thing I want you to do is go ahead and open up your website folder and I want you to copy the logo that you're going to use into that folder and let's just go ahead and open this up and this is the logo that I designed actually in Photoshop quite a while ago I probably should do a video on this by the way but you know there's never enough time in the day now you can use square logos you can use rectangles circles whatever you want to use I generally like to use squares but you can use whatever you want so again copy that to your website folder and let's just open up our website here really quickly and of course this is where we want to add our logo right into our header section so let's go ahead and close this out so the first thing we need to do of course is add the HTML we need to have that in place and of course this is an image so we can go ahead and just use this IMG code that we already have let's just copy that and we'll paste it right up into our header div there we go now of course the name isn't Rome dot PNG we use that in the last lecture it is logo and I believe it was a JPEG file so let's just put that in here and there we go so let's go ahead and save this and let's reopen up our web page and just see what this looks like and there you can see it's way too big for our web page so we need to shrink that and size it to our header now you might be asking well why did it do that since it was already inside the header why didn't it automatically size and that's because we just put in the raw HTML the browser doesn't know any better it's going to use the original size of the image so we need to shrink this at least to the size of the header now you could do what we did in the last video you could go ahead and reduce that in Photoshop or Microsoft Paint but a bunch of people ask me how do I do this in CSS and that's what I'm going to show you in this video so remember that an IMG element we talked about this a long time ago in the series is an inline element in order to Center it we need to convert that to block and you'll remember we use the display property but first we need to actually create some CSS so let's just go ahead and copy and paste this body rule set and we'll go all the way to the bottom and we'll just paste this here and of course we're going to go ahead and use the IMG type selector so that's what we're going to select the IMG and as I said the first thing we need to do is convert it to a block level element that will allow us to Center it so you know what I'm sorry about that I got ahead of myself we actually want to shrink this first so we need to use the max width and max height properties so I'm going to go ahead and just copy and paste this in here I've already got this typed out and I'll explain that so there we go we got the max width we got the max height we want to set that to 100% that will expand it to the width and height of our header section or our header div and you might ask well why didn't the browser know to do that well it doesn't again that was just the raw HTML here we are saying hey expand this out to the exact width and the exact height of the element that the IMG is inside of in this case by the way it is the header this div right here so this now should expand out appropriately in terms of the width and height so let's go ahead and save everything up and we'll see if this works and it did and you'll notice it actually keeps the original aspect ratio to this little square didn't try to make this a rectangle it'll keep the original aspect ratio which was a square which is what we wanted so that fits nice and neat now maybe you want this logo right here on the left and that's fine you don't have to do anything at this point but what if you wanted to have it on the right or you wanted to go ahead and put this in the center well we need to do a couple different things first if you want it all the way to the right we can just float it right so let's go ahead and do that and we'll just put in float and then right and let's go ahead and see what we get and there you can see it's now all the way on the right so again you can certainly go ahead and do it that way if you want it and some people actually do that you'll see a lot of websites put their logo all the way on the right but others will actually put it on the center you don't see it on the left quite as much but most of the time it's either in the center or on the far right so let's go ahead now and I'll show you how to actually Center this if you wish to do so so as I said in the beginning we need to make this IMG element a black element because by default it is inline and you'll remember that from those videos I did earlier so let's go ahead and we'll make this a block level element and that will allow us now to Center it so we need to use the margin left and margin right properties and I'll go ahead and just copy and paste those in here and there we go and the value that we use is auto auto will Center it that's the value that you use if you use auto it will automatically Center it so by using Auto basically what you're saying here is hey Center this all the way from the left and center this all the way from the right so that's how that works so let's go ahead now and we'll save this and let's see what we get and there you see it's now centered so those are some of the CSS strategies that you can use when you're adding a logo to your header section
