alright guys welcome to your twelfth html5 tutorial where we are going to finish laying our website hopefully if I got enough time so the next thing we need to cover is this main section now this main section is basically our two main articles so if we go ahead and take a look at our main section we can see that we have article 1 and article 2 and outside that we have a side section with the news so we aren't going to be styling that yeah just our main two articles so let's go ahead and hop back in notepad in our main message file rather and we can go ahead and start styling links with main underscore section now the very first thing I want to do is I want to float this to the left now this is very important because right now if we look at our website pretty much everything is underneath each other now what I want to do is I want to take this main section and take it to the left and to the right of that I want to have this little new section now in order to do that I need to change the layout of this by changing the float now whenever I do this these articles are going to be on the left hand side in this new section is going to be on the right hand side now another thing that we need to remember is our entire website is 1,000 pixels wide so we need to organize our main section in our side section and we need to make sure that we don't go over a thousand pixels because if we do then it's going to say okay you don't have enough room and it's going to be placed under it so that's another key thing that we want to take note of so you need to make sure you have a thousand in mind so the very first thing in order to shift this to the left is put float left and I talked about float in my CSS story so if you don't know what I'm doing go watch them please so the another thing I want to do is I want to set the width of this section now I'm going to be setting the width to let me think if I hit 660 pixels that's going to set the initial width however I'm also going to be adding a margin now I'm going to be adding a margin of 30 pixel now whenever I apply margin like this this is going to give it a margin all around the element top bottom left and right so we need to account for that whenever we're adding up the total so the width of this is 660 but we have a margin of 30 pixels on each side so 660 plus 30 for the left is 690 plus 30 for the right is 720 so we have a total pixel count of 720 for this entire section I'll add a little comment and a comment and CSS is just great like this so we it's nice to have comments whenever you're working with um you know specific numbers especially when you can't go over a certain value so I'll say that this is 720 pixels and I'll also say we have 280 left so now whenever we're making our new section we need to make sure that it doesn't go over 280 pixels simple enough so let's go ahead and take care of that right now so we don't forget it and if we go ahead and take a look at our website real quick we can see that our new section is now to the left floated left and all the other stuff is now to the right of it whenever you float something left it pretty much says well this is pretty much a really clear example instead of me trying to explain just look what's going on right here so now if we take that side news is that outside news yep side news okay so now if we take that side news section we can go ahead and start laying out this exactly how we want it so the very first thing I'm going to do is float this left so float left however it can't have the same width the width of this is let me think for a second okay I think I got it okay so the width W ID th that goes with that's how you do it so the width of this is going to be 220 now remember we have 280 left so we can do a couple of things if I write that correctly so aside from that I want to change the margin of this now the margin of the side news is going to be first I want to add some space on the top because if I shift this down a little bit from the top it's going to look a whole lot nicer so I'm going to go ahead and add a margin of 20 pixels on the top and 0 on the bottom so that takes care of my top and bottom now since we have a width of 20 and we need to take this take up a total of 280 that means we can have a padding of 30 on each side because 220 plus 30 plus 30 that's going to give us our 280 so if we go ahead and change our padding setting and we just add this as 30 pixels then that's going to give us our 280 total so hopefully 720 plus 280 is going to give us other a thousand to fit perfectly in our big wrapper and another thing is make sure that you don't have a border on either your main section or your side news because even if you have a border of one pixel then that's pretty much going to throw everything off and it's going to ruin that so that is why it's very important to have a calculator nearby whenever you're doing all this so the very last thing I want to do is actually I'm going to add a background for this just so you guys can clearly see the difference between the new section in the main section and I actually remember one of these it's a 6 6 CC CC and that's going to give you a nice light blue color I don't even that's kind of embarrassing that I know that but thanks to many years of Photoshop I do know that so basically you can see that okay our main section is laid out on the left and our side news is floated to pretty much the right however we have this footer right here and that's not good we want this footer to be centered kind of below both this article and this little new section we don't want to just randomly on the right-hand side right there so let's take care of that problem right now so I believe I just named I named it footer or the footer the footer some go ahead and copy that because I'm extremely lazy and we reference that by hitting pound and the footer and now what we need to do in order to kind of take away the floating properties we need to add a property called clear and the value we need to set both now what this pretty much means is okay for this footer I don't want any floating crap on the left or right I kind of want it to be its own thing so that's just kind of going to reset it to the default layout make it a plain block level element so if we go ahead and save this right now our layout should be good and it is now under both of these pretty much nothing is floating to the left hand side of this or the right hand side of this now what we want to do is we want to Center this beast because it looks kind of weird on the left hand side there so in order to do that just put text align Center and that's going to go ahead and center that now before I test this out I want to do a couple more things I want to add a padding and I'm just add a padding of like 20 pixels and I also want to change of the border but I don't want to border all the way around this I only want a border on top of this because I think that'll look it will pretty much give it a horizontal rule kind of look make sure that there's a line only on top of it separating it from the rest of the website so I'm going to add a border top and I'm going to give this oh let's see let's give it two pixels solid green so now if I go ahead and save this and refresh it you can see that you see why I didn't want to border around all of it because there's already a border to the bottom of it in the left and right so if I put a border just across the top of it it's going to go ahead and separate this footer from the rest of the website and it's going to give it kind of a cool-looking look cool looking look mmm funny I should say that so this website is looking pretty good right here and we have our overall layout complete this is floated to the left this is floated to the left everything is nice and organized this footers position exactly how we want it however these articles right here they don't really look that great we can spice them up a little bit and I'm going to be showing you guys a couple cool tricks with those so I'm running out of time for now and I actually need a drink because my voice is getting kind of course but anyways I will talk to you guys about that in the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys then
