I was going everyone and welcome back to a next episode on how to validate a website now in the last episode you've learned how to upload a website to the Internet and I talked briefly about how to validate your website before you uploaded and I think this is something that is so important to talk about that I wanted to create a separate lesson just for validating a website so that's what we're gonna do today I'm gonna talk about why we need to validate it and how we can validate it both with HTML and CSS so as you can see in front of me I do actually have a website that I want to test out if this is actually a valid website and this is the website we've been creating in this course here so if you want to download this website you can go in the description of this video and download it if you want to if not then you just need to create your own website or just create something really quickly that you can use with this example here it doesn't really need to be anything special you just need to have a HTML page and a CSS style sheet that you can test out with me if you just want to create something really quickly so what I want to do now is I want to take a look at the website inside the browser and if we were to scroll up and down we can actually see that that doesn't really seem to be any kind of errors they ADEs tml is structured correctly this year says styling seems to be working like it should so it does really look like there's any kind of errors but I can actually tell you that before recording this episode I purposely went into the HTML markup and inside the CSS styling and made a couple of errors on purpose so why can't we see it inside the browser then well one thing the browser's do when you run a HTML markup website that has CSS styling applied to it is that if you have any kind of errors inside your markup the browser's gonna try to figure out what kind of error did you make and what did you try to do inside your code or inside your markup and is then gonna try to fix it when it shows the to visually inside the browser so right now even though I do have errors it's gonna try to fix it by itself the good thing about this is that it allow for us to make errors and get away with it but the bad thing is that we do have errors inside our code or inside our markup and it needs to be fixed and sometimes we don't actually see the errors because it tries to fix it for us so what we can do is we can actually take the website and test it out inside a HTML and CSS validator to see if there's any kind of errors we don't see inside the browser now the testing tool we're going to use to something created by w3c which is a community that creates the standards that we see in the web today and these are the people that decide what is the correct standard when we make websites and they have a tool for both HTML validation and also when it comes to CSS validation so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to validator dot w3.org and I'm gonna go and use the validate in order to test out our website which right now like I said Dutchman look like there's any kind of errors inside the browser so what I can do inside this website here so I can test out the website in three different ways I can first of all go and get the URL for my website which you can only do if your website is online so right now because I'm locally on my computer I can't take my link and just test it out it needs to be online so I'm not going to use the first tool here the second tool is by uploading a file by it's aching the HTML file and then uploading it to the website and then testing it and the third option is we can actually write code directly inside the website and then test it out inside this little input here now what I want to do for this episode is I want to go ahead and just upload one of the files from the website since I haven't uploaded it to the web yet so inside this folder here I do actually have the front page of my website the one that you guys saw inside the browser and I also have the stylesheet and then a folder with the images for the website but we don't need to do anything with that folder so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and drag and drop my index file into the upload area then I'm gonna go ahead and see if you want to add more options to it right now we don't want to but we could take a look at these different options and do something to it again like I said we're not gonna touch it and then I'm just gonna go ahead and run check and as you can see we get a bunch of errors inside the mark-up which again we can't see inside the actual web site here so let's actually go and take a look at what we have inside the testing here now down where we have notes and potential issues we have a couple of different notes that were given to us to see what Aeros we might have inside our markup now forward to scroll further down the page you can see we have validation output which gives us a more accurate idea about where inside the code we might have errors so this is the one I'm gonna use in order to figure out where the box are inside the code or inside the the markup now the first error says that we don't have a document type declaration which means that we don't have any kind of markup that says what kind of document are we talking about now as a default we should be telling it that we have a html5 document and everything below this document is html5 code so if I were to go back inside the actual code for the website you can see at the top here I didn't declare that this was a html5 document so what I can do is I can go ahead and say we have a doctype which is an html5 doctype just going to save it and then I'm gonna try to re-upload the code to the validator or the the markup to the validator so back at the top here I'm just gonna drag and drop the document in here again then I'm gonna say revalidate o revalidate it's called recheck it and then you can see we get still errors but we should have less errors than before and you can actually see that there's a lot less errors than before so right now it says that we have 4 errors the first one is that we don't have any text in between the title tags so right now for where to go inside my markup you can see the title tags doesn't have any text inside of it so we can say this is a website just to have something in here I'm gonna save it then I'm gonna go back into the validator and check for the next error that says we have a bad value which is a bad URL that links to the fonts that are used inside the website now this is actually Google's own suggestion to what I should link to in order to get the fonts working inside the website and now you might be asking me well how can Google's own link they want to suggest it for me to use in order to link to the fonts inside Google's library ba error because it's Google we're talking about don't they know how to link to a font correctly well when you link to fonts using google fonts it typically gives you this pipe symbol inside the link to the fonts which is something that our validate is not really that happy about seeing so we can get around this in another way so were to go inside my HTML markup again and go to the link here used to link to Google's own font I can go to the pipe symbol delete it and use something called URL encoding which means that we have a set of characters or a string of characters that we can use that when you run it inside the URL is going to interpret as a single character so the character we have when it comes to a pipe symbol is using % 7c which means that if you were to take these three characters and run it inside the URL it's going to show you a pipe symbol so if we were to run this again inside the validator it's going to take these characters and turn it into a symbol so this is how we can fix the errors when it comes to linking to Google's own fonts which is sort of a weird thing that Google hasn't addressed is which is an issue when it comes to validating a website now if we go back inside the validator you can see that we have two more errors left's one that says that we have a end tag for the body but there's unclosed elements before we get to the body tag hmm now if we look at the last error it says that we have an unclothed element which must mean the unclosed element that we have inside arrow number three so let's actually go and take a look at the fourth one and fix that one and see if it doesn't fix the third error so we go down it says we have a div that doesn't have a closing tag now we do actually have it div down here says that we called a wrapper inside of markup so if I go back inside my HTML markup and scroll down to the wrapper that we have at the bottom here this one right here you can see that we go down to the bottom after the footer what we need to have the closing tag we don't have a closing div and this is actually a typical air that I see a lot of people they forget to fix inside their code or inside the markup because when people start making websites and their new added a lot of times to make the opening tag but they forget to make the closing tag which is a really important thing to look out for so I'm just gonna go and create a closing div tag gonna save it and then I'm gonna try to re-upload the code or the markup inside the validator so I'm just gonna grab my my file again drop it in here and check it and now I can see you have no errors inside our HTML markup so this is how we can fix HTML markup using this valid data and again I'm gonna link to it in the description in case you haven't gotten the link for this specific website now when it comes to CSS styling we need to use a different validator because this is only for HTML markup now the link for the CSS validator is called jigsaw dot David three org forward slash CSS - validator and again I'm gonna go and even link the description so you can just open up if you want to now the CSS validator is very similar to the HTML validator so we can see we can either use a link we can use file upload or direct input so for what to go ahead and grab my CSS file drag it in here check it you can see if you get an error message now if you take a look at the error it found you can actually see that on line 115 we have a parse error that says we have something wrong with this piece of CSS styling so if we go inside our CSS file to line 115 go down to where it says 115 you can see that we have the head of styling down him somewhere around here we have an error message or not an error message but an error and if we were to take a look at the main tag you can actually see that I forgot to include a curly brackets at the opening of this styling here so were to save it go back inside the validator re-uploaded and we just need to go back to do that so I'm just gonna refresh grab the CSS file drag it in and check it you can now see that there's no errors found inside to CSS styling and again I didn't really test out the CSS down before I made this episode so I'm just happy to see that when we created this website back some episodes ago there was no errors when we did it so this is how we can validate a website using these different tools now it's very important to mention that you need to validate your website before you upload it to the internet just because there's errors inside your markup but also because it might affect the search ranking inside Google if you have errors sided code so it's very importantly to fix these errors now second of all she was actually taken exam studying web development I'm pretty sure that teachers will require that you validate a website before you turn in your website for an exam because it's super important that you validate your website and if you don't do it and there's errors believe me the teachers will validate it and see if there's any kind of errors inside the mark-up so if you're a student and you want to create a website for an exam project make sure that you validate your website okay this is pretty much what I want to say in this episode I hope you all enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music]
