so today we're going to get into how to do web development now I want to draw a quick distinction before we get into stuff what's the difference between web design and web development and basically web design is more graphic design it means you work with Photoshop you make the look in the feel of the web page and then you give it to a developer they're going to take your look and feel and they're going to make the actual web page for you the designers don't tend to get paid as much they don't tend to have as much opportunity to work remotely I used to be a designer and I moved on to development because it was just a better career to get into so that's kind of the difference also it's cheaper to be a web developer you don't have to buy a thousand dollars worth of Adobe Photoshop software all you need is notepad that's right notepad except for you'll probably want to get something better than notepad we are going to be using sublime text which is one of the best notepad kind of editors out there and it's free so go ahead go download sublime text pause the video come back when you got it fire it up and we're going to build a web page so what we're going to do is we're going to start by creating a new file in sublime text and saving it as index.html as you see here we're basically you can call it whatever you want but the fact that we're calling it dot HTML means that when we open it up in Chrome it's going to know that it's a web page so it's going to show it as an HTML web page and today we're going to be learning HTML later we're going to be learning CSS which is another skill you need to learn to be a web developer and then later on you're going to learn JavaScript JavaScript is what HTML is what puts the content together for your page but it's going to be ugly because it's just content CSS is what puts together your style it stands for cascading cascading style sheets so basically it gives look feel and style to your webpage but we're not going to cover that today so what we're going to make today is ugly be prepared we're going to get into style later and then Java Script is function it makes the web page do cool things load in data real time just like Pinterest does and like Instagram it makes things move around and animate Java Script is where things get fun it's also where you get paid better if you learn HTML CSS you know you get paid fine you get paid normal but if you get really good at JavaScript people are really looking for people are good at JavaScript you can get paid quite a bit and it's a lot easier to get remote work or very flexible work so we know further ado we let's get into making an HTML page so you've saved your index.html now go to Chrome and Open File open your index.html file where you saved it mine shows localhost because I'm using live reload basically whatever I type it's automatically going to refresh over here for me automatically for you you're going to have to hit save you're gonna have to come over to Chrome you're gonna have to hit refresh but I for the sake of this video I'm doing it differently so let's build an HTML page the core of HTML is tags basically that's all there is to HTML is tags a tag is basically something surrounded by greater than and less than kind of quotes and so this is an HTML tag and this is a closing HTML tag pardon me if you can hear my baby crying somewhere way in the background I'm not sure what's going on out there but I'm sure mom will take care of it said like a good dad right so here we have HTML opening tag HTML closing tag tags are a little awkward to type at first because they use those keys down towards the bottom right that you don't use very often but I promise you'll get fast very quickly so basically anything in between these HTML tags is considered within the HTML tags there's basically three tags that you're going to use to create a web page there's an HTML which means hey this is my HTML page anything inside of this is considered your web page you're going to make a head tag which we'll get into in a little bit and you're going to make a body tag whatever's in the body tag is what your user will see and interact with so I'm going to put in here hello world and now I have a web page congratulations your web developer you're probably thinking wow this is kind of complicated it's all this code look stuff don't worry it looks like a foreign language at first but seriously within five times you're going to feel very comfortable there's only like ten tags maybe 20 at the most you're going to use and they're all tags you just have to remember a different word so far all we've actually done is created three tags we made an HTML tag we put a head tag with inside of it and we put a body tag with inside of it as well and these are considered siblings they're next to each other I'm also going to add a title tag and inside of the title I'm going to put my webpage and I can't type today my webpage and now you look at the top when you refresh it says my webpage at the top of your web page or your tab so once again the head is not what the user interacts with this is all reserved for other stuff which is why the title goes up there and so the body is what the user interacts with and we did hello world and the rest of our example we'll be adding other tags in here so let me show you kind of some other tags this is bold so we're going to wrap bold or it's called wrapping it in be tags and now you can see that bold is bold because I wrapped it in B which stands for bold e/m is what we're going to use for italic and e/m basically stands for emphasis it used to be people would use I it also works but that is not the correct way to do it anymore do not show a prospective employer that because it's not good so B is for bold e/m is for italic and then let's see actually strong I can't believe I did this strong is what we're going to use for bold we used to use B and we used to use I and we used to use you for underline but now we use strong for bold and we use e/m for italics and we started doing this when we started getting into mobile devices and devices that might not actually have the capability of rendering bold or italics and so we needed some other way to let the user know or maybe it's a screen reader that you should display it in whatever way you can so but for the most part strong is always bold e/m is always italic that's about all you need to know so we've covered bold and italic now let's get into a critical tag the a tag that makes a hyperlink to another webpage when you click on it so we're going to make a google comm and guess what it doesn't go anywhere that's because it doesn't know where to go one thing that some tags need is what's called attributes we've defined an a tag but this a tag doesn't know enough about itself to know where to go we know what's inside of it google.com text but we need to know where to go so we're going to add an href attribute you add an attribute by doing equals and then a pair of quotes and whatever's inside of the quotes is setting the href so Google com there you go and look magically now I'm underlined and I have that purple color because I've been to google.com before and look I can now go back and forth from google.com to my webpage all like that you're now a web developer it's tremendous so let's do another tag and IMG for image and this one needs to know what the source of the image is I'll leave that blank for now and that's all an image tag is for the source I'm going to go look something up on Google and let's just look up an image of Simon Cowell sure everybody loves Simon right why not let's view image I'm going to copy the URL why won't you let me close I don't know okay my computer is acting strange hit save and look there we go Google commlink and a nice link to Simon Cowell's web website see if I can close this there we go so basically that's your core tags another thing you'll probably notice is is these are not coming on to new lines like we've typed them out at first that doesn't make sense and it seems very bad but later on you'll realize it's very very good how HTML works is is it does not recognize anything except for how you program it to go so unless you say it with tags it doesn't know what to do and that's because these things can get huge or sometimes they'll get word wrapping like this and it just doesn't know what to do so it's not going to make any guesses for you if you don't say line break which is a br tag it doesn't line break so there we go I added a br tag and now it's bold whoops I want to add another line break because right now Simon Cowell's on the same line as all other friends so I'm going to be are there you go so now we got this is bold line break this is italic Google calm line break and an image that's kind of how you start structuring your webpage and you're probably thinking this is ugly this doesn't feel like building a web page but this is about as complicated as HTML gets for real I'm not making it up HTML is not much more complicated than this you just have to remember a few tags a few attributes like href and source and that's about it I can show you a few more tags here ul is something you'll use a lot that stands for unordered list and inside this you'll add el eyes so here I've added an Li which stands for line item item 1 item 2 and now you see we've got our you know I'm going to get rid of mr. Simon nobody likes to see him for very long anyway okay there we go so now we've got an unordered list which by default is just going to display with bullet points item 1 item 2 you can style these a lot of different ways so you're going to use the UL a lot anytime you have a list of items you're going to use a UL with allies inside of it a drop down navigation is a list of items you'll use ul Li an actual navigation is a list of items you'll use ul Li a list of mp3s in fake mp3 player online you ELLs with allies another thing very similar is OLS and that's and that is ordered list and that actually by default is going to spit out numbers for each item you don't really use this one very often but it's helpful to know that it exists we're almost out of tags honestly folks there's div tags which you use a lot but we're not going to show you that's basically for styling so we're going to leave it untouched right now span tags you'll also use a decent bit but once again that is for styling so that is about as complicated as HTML gets all you have to do is get comfortable typing in tags and you're pretty much an HTML developer paragraph tags those are important and header tags and then we'll be done P is for paragraph that's another way to kind of separate text let's say we added this four times it's starting to get a little messy and I forgot to close these P and H P in a / P there we go so inside of this paragraph we have this I don't know what that did right there inside of this paragraph we have a block of text for each one and you'll see the paragraph automatically kind of created its own space on either side paragraphs are usually the way you're going to want to add fresh line breaks usually you don't want to use the br tag like we're using there but it has its purposes as well BR creates a line break as you can see here and P creates as fresh paragraph with space on either side the only other tags are going to use our header tags they start with H depending on how big you want the header to be you'll use h1 for the biggest h2 is smaller than that nh3 and so on down to about h6 or so it's pretty rare to have headers being in six different sizes you're probably pretty bad at design if you're doing that and when it refreshes there you go big not so big not really big and then we're down to our normal text so that is HTML design so our next thing we're going to cover style so you can actually not feel like a fake developer you get to feel like a real developer in the next one as we start to style our things CSS gets a little more complicated so I'd encourage you take a little time make some links make some different webpages and just have fun with HTML for a little while before you move forward and our next one we're going to do a little bit more advanced HTML and we're going to do a little bit more style
