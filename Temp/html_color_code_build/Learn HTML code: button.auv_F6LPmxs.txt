hello there today's video is on HTML and it's how to make a button so I've got a blank document over here let's go ahead and open it up with notepad plus plus buttons ER are pretty awesome you can just have a button or you can have a button as part of a form field I'm not going to cover the form field part today I'm just going to show you how to make a button so the idea is you just do a open brackets button close brackets and then of course you got a closed slash button so this is tag that you have to close let's do a launch it in Chrome there it is there's a blank button doesn't really do anything you just click on it if you want to put some text on the button then you need to put a write here some text and we save that let's refresh it there we go buttons aren't toys buttons aren't toys so if you want to make it do something cool like hyperlink let's do a a href equals open and then we'll do a HTTP colon slash slash www dot that's right technological com closed quote close the bracket now let's close the href oh I didn't open my bracket there /a now let's do the bracket by less than sign do that save that and we refresh and then you just have a little button click it and it'll go to you know to a URL or to another page or something like that so maybe you want to use it as a previous page or next page or something like that there's a couple of cool things that they will do let me show you a couple of the options auto focus equals and this is the weirdest one auto focus what what else would auto focus equal so we save that let's refresh the page and you can see the little dotted line on the button that means it's already selected all you do is press the Enter key and it goes right to it so there's the option to disabled although isn't going to work in this scenario so we do a disabled equals disabled oh I need to put quotes on that disable that second one it's kind of weird that they have these options that uh there it is it's grayed out let's take the hyperlink off because the hyperlink will still work in this scenario so we do that we save it refresh it and the button is no longer clickable that's what it means by disabled if you had the hyperlink around it and it's going to re-enable then you know it's the hyperlink still going to work even if the button is disabled but this is just a little way that you can make a little button that you can do like style equals open quotes color : red semicolon and we'll have a border radius that's probably hyphenated border radius of let's say 10 pixels semicolon close the quote save it put a little CSS on there see if that'll work yeah so the text is read the buttons around it it's still disabled we we don't want to do disabled lets rien a belit here save it now refresh it hey yeah it's pretty little button so you can also do like a border radius or something like that and build a shuffle little button next page previous page but kind of thing I'm going to cover the buttons more in the form video but this is how you make a button without having a form so hopefully you've learned something from this and you'll get to use this in future remember buttons aren't toys thank you if you've enjoyed the experience of this tutorial why not share it with your friends
