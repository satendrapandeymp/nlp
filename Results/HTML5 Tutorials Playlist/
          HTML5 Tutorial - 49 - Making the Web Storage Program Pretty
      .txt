alright guys welcome to your 49th html5 tutorial in in this lesson we're just going to be making this website look a little bit prettier because this is so ugly looking I think I'm going to throw up if I don't do anything to it soon so go ahead and hop over to your CSS file and remember we have two big boxes here that's what she said a left box and right box in the left box just go ahead and reference it by a left box ID let's just go ahead and first float this baby to the left which basically means push it to the left whenever they're spaced now let's go ahead and give a padding of 20 pixels just so our form whenever you make a box around it a border around it rather then it isn't butted right up against the border so let me just add my border at something and noticeable 3 pixels solid and red so this is pretty much going to make a box that fits to the size of the elements and it's just going to be pushed to the left now let's go ahead and do that same thing with the right box easily actually you know what I think it would have taken less time if I didn't even copy that but yet definitely with all these mistakes incorrect okay now our right box what we want to do is add a few more properties the first thing we wanted to do is float this baby to the left which basically means okay this box is already going to be pushed against the left just push this in next place available we want to give this one a set width because by default it has this stuff in it but some of you guys might not put anything in there at all so if we don't give a set width and it might disappear as a little line on some browsers or not appear at all on other browsers so let's just go ahead and give it a set width of like 250 pixels that should be enough and now what I want to do is in order not to have it but it up immediately against other box we want to give it a margin but we only want to give a margin on the left hand side so March and left of 20 pixels is going to give a space between this box and the box to the left of it which was appropriately named left box now let's go ahead and give some padding 20 pixels would do just fine and give it a border that is the exact same as this one but I to make this one blue blue so let me go ahead and save this and check it out all right so let me move this so you guys can see so basically what we have is this red one is the left box that has and you see the padding around of 20 pixels and this right one is called the right box in this margin left is this what gives us is twenty little pixels of padding right here or margin padding something else many ways now that our website is looking pretty dang good I think what we can do is hop over and start coding the functionality to it because check it out what this program basically gonna do is it's going to store a variable for us and technically their I don't even know if they're called variables I think they're called like a key in values or keys but it's basically like a variable so whenever our user goes to the website they're going to enter something like a username and a password now whenever we store this it's going to go ahead and save it on their computer well there are different ways that we can save it I'll talk about that later on well what we want to do is we want to save this information so then you know if they go to other websites or excuse me go to other websites or web pages or if they browse around our website we have that information stored and they don't have to enter their username every single time so in order to store that we need to use something called the web storage API and that's what this Save button is going to do so right now it doesn't do anything but in the next story I'm going to show you how to code it so thank you guys for watching I'm going to subscribe and I will see you guys then
