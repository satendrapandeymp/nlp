this video is an update about responsive image maps and I've had so many emails and feedback about this the one I did a while ago is a little outdated in the fact that I was using a third-party site and they've taken the cord down so here we have the my client image map and this is all this is is this here so when we go in there but a pawn and this is a knight and this is a queen and it all works fine when you come down to the responsive part this is all over the place and you get them at the bottom where you have to scroll across so that isn't responsive and so what we're going to have to do is use a plugin for this so I've already done this as I said what we're going to do now is just go to this site here which is somebody called mud store it's the same one as I used in the original video and and what if you go on his site there you see what a cop and blossom and bubbles and when you go in to what would be their mobile phone size you see that still works is Buttercup blossom and bubbles so that's what you basically want is the responsive side of that what our house now doesn't work at all for that so he aces download the plug-in from github and what you need to do is this is the page and this is cloner download the sand what you do is just download that a computer these two files at the bottom are the ones that really need these two here the GS at the jQuery files and you download them to the to your computer your folder put all these in the same folder and then what I would suggest is actually go back to where he said until the source code from their view source and you see how he's actually done it he does tell you but this is where he's donut I've actually changed a little bit of the cordon one them when I'm going to show you and see this bit at the bottom I've already put these in he's my jQuery files here the two at the bottom of these ones just for quickness basically worry seein is to put this here script you check up there just before the div their worries pause and at the end of the image mop so you just go copy and I'll put this into my file and just before the body is here and you just pierced R into there okay another part of this and this is that's very important by putting the up just before the body you go up a bit this is his image mops but you can of course use your your own on that one and  that's a little obvious cause of and this here is the other part of the script so would you copy that and put this in the head section of our web page so you can put that anywhere in the head there so you use peer start or yogi right now they say on master site he's doing quite a bit of styling for this and it's it it's quite a bit of what you don't really need I don't think but anyways so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do my one and which a hope is I'm just trying to make this as simple as possible I know if we go here and the one out done and if I just sear this okay I'll save that refresh the browser right here the where it should work because this is at full range but when it wasn't a mobile again we having problems now I've had a few people that haven't done the style and this is where they go and wrong because they put in the the JavaScript or the jQuery and the put are incorrectly and sometimes somehow some haven't wear some harmful where the body is what we really need to do is put the styling this is this is very very important because it's responsive by itself so if I just put imj and curly brackets and we put and a width or two and we're going to put max width I'm going to put that at 100% okay so now we're just going to save that as well save and we're going to put this in here refresh the browser and there we go so that's refreshed and now that is responsive they bears the chest there's you I'll put horse there hope you can see this horse and your porn so that's all responsive right across the board now that's responsive so when you compute a mode they are and it's everything is everything is responsive and but again they jail and that is fine and that's the way you work that this is there this is very much too aside he does a bit bit longer style than than I have there that is the easiest way are and do it and if I just take this out so you understand how important the stylers you take the JavaScript away from this and this won't be a responsive image map or it will be a responsive image so take the whole JavaScript away from that you see of that and we refresh the browser again okay right see there's no way where I've got the the night there there's no it's not an image mark but it is an image and it's responsive that's so important that stylesheet is to say it is it it works at the computer end of the scale but doesn't work at the mobile because there's no plugin it's all taken away but this is a style and it's responsive even without the JavaScript so that that is where some people are falling short on this so but that really is a very very important thing is when you the style makes the image responsive and JavaScript or the jQuery is the bit that makes the images the image maps where you where you click on your links and in whatever you want to do with them so that's basically yet if you have again like I said on all videos if you have any problems with any code or trying to get this to work that's that's fine just get back to us and what I've done just in case then either there's a third-party problem again with the cord I've put on my website this so the cordon is always there for everybody and this is enbe designs an image map dot HTML I'll put this in the description or care so again there's your paw on your horse and again this is all responsive and it's all it's all working as an image map and a responsive image map and all you have to do in there if you if all you want you if you find it bit difficult all do is you do this few sauce and you'll see the cord out given and how it's done and on and it's as easy as I can I think this is probably the easiest way to to do this with a very simple style bit are kind of actually the computer's not allow us to scroll down there and sometimes does this one I'm doing videos that you just compute it's not very good but all you have to do is just copy and paste this this paracord and let's work enough and you can see all that of course you do you own image maps so you between here is the thing that you were actually doing yourself so I hope that's beneficial of people and again just get back to is if you don't don't understand any of that so thank you for watching and thank you for listening
