what's up guys Salar here from code phenom welcome to the next installment on my HTML CSS tutorial series so today we're gonna get into HTML tags attributes and elements now one of the most important concepts you're ever going to learn is tags in HTML this the concept of tags is simply telling the browser or the project yourself what is going on what is about to happen in every line of code so we're going to investigate tags attributes and then elements so let's get into tags first tags are like I said things that that will signify ok this is about to happen in my code one of most you know easy examples you can never think about is the P which actually stands for paragraph and it's going to output text to your project so one thing to notice is that there is an opening and a closing tag they tag x' always come in pairs and tags are surround elements so anything you put in between the opening and the closing tag is your element those are the out that's the element that is affected by the tags and that tag whatever the tag is supposed to do what is it where it's designed to do will apply to everything inside and that everything inside is called the element now tags themselves can also be modified and one of the most popular examples is the image because the image tag so let's create our let's create our pair okay and like before you can see the opening and closing tags have a difference where the closing tag has a slash after the opening angle bracket you need that slash could that tells that you're closing that tag and it's kind of like if you ever done any of the programming C++ is basically any language you need to hide close all of your curly brackets to make sure that whatever code is inside isn't you know kind of leaked on to the next bit and let's just you know focus more on HTML so right now I have a set of P tags and then a set of image tags right now I don't need the paragraph I don't want to in protecting soon explained image the attributes in terms of the image tag so the tags right now are this is the image tag I'm dealing with it's gonna tell my browser I'm about to output an image to the website and I want you to do this for me but attributes are what make each tag special you notice how you can modify that tag to better suit whatever your application is whatever you need it for so there are there's a difference between acceptable attributes and then required attributes acceptable could mean something like an image width is not necessary image the image tag will automatically load the height and width of the whatever image you're pointing you to but like I just like you know let just like I said it to you the browser will actually same question but where's the image so the most required part the required attribute for the image tag is something called SRC which stands for source attributes come in the form of you give the name of the attribute and these are already predefined so the source attribute is called SRC so you have the attribute name you put an equal signs and then you write your argument the argument is whatever you do however you're making it more you know modified to your application so mine is source equals and for locations you all want type in quotation mark and we're gonna talk about that later on and I'm just gonna say that it's located in this folder right here and there we go so as of right now we're telling the program that we're loading an image and the source of that image is right over here it's located in the image folder slash logo dot PNG and this can also be any link like an imgur link or a - or you know whatever is it ends in a file extension of the a lines like this so now that's that so that the source attribute is a required attribute by the image tag I just you know wrote before a acceptable but not necessary tag is something called the width attribute and that width attribute says okay I know that the image size just for example is 100 pixels by 100 pixels but I don't want you to load the image onto the website as 100 100 pixels maybe I want the width to be 80 pixels you don't have an 80 px and now to the load on the image but 80 pixels and alternatively maybe you don't know exactly what how many pixels you want so you can even change this to a percent notice how I did not use quotation marks quotation marks are kind of like strings they say okay this value is non variable which kind of means it's never gonna change so if you want to load something here it is if you say something equals without a quotation mark it is a is it value I can't change it we're gonna investigate this later on if you don't extend it right now don't worry so that is that so we went through what tags are which in this case is the image tag we went through attributes arguments and then elements as well within the P tag so let's jump into the next video and then I'll see what we can go through so see you guys there you
