hi everybody thanks for coming back and watching another tutorial video if you like these tutorials then please let me know in the comments below if you have anything you want to see me try and make then yeah just let me know so this video was inspired by my web development projects for beginners video which you can watch here I'm gonna be building a random color generator in JavaScript the idea being that every time the user clicks a button they get a brand new random color I just like to build this because when I'm building my own personal projects you always need to come up with colors and you know I kind of don't want to just stick with red green and blue all the time it's nice to just you know come up with a random color maybe so there we go that's step one of building a project find an issue or a problem you're having and try and think how you can solve it in code step two would then be to kind of jock that idea down on a piece of paper so walk yourself through the steps of what you're going to need to do to start with zero and then actually end up with a random color on your screen and then step three of course is getting down and writing the code so without further ado let's take it away so the first thing you gonna want to do is go to github and open up a new project and then clone it to your local machine if you wanna learn how to do this I've made another video on it so just click here and it will take you to that video in the meantime I'll just open up one now okay so now that I've made a project I'm just gonna go here and open in desktop okay great so now that's on my system I should see it in here random colors okay so I want to go ahead and open that up now in sublime text okay so now that I've opened up the project in sublime text I'm gonna add three things to it an index.html file a CSS file and a JavaScript file so let's call this one a text or HTML make a new one call it site dot CSS and make a new one and call it site JX so now I have an index a CSS and a JavaScript file on the project ready to go so here in using sublime text I can bootstrap or boilerplate a project very easily I just start typing HTML I hit enter and then I get all this lovely code which for most part right now I don't actually need sets get rid of everything in the body and I'll leave modern eyes in there I don't need for that sort of get rid of that and let's call the project the title random Carlos okay and let's also go ahead while we're here and that link up with my CSS we'll also add in the JavaScript while we're here so script that site dot J s okay so I have my index.html file I have my CSS file which is here and it's linked here and I have my JavaScript file which is here and it's linked here okay so first things first let's go ahead and just check that's all working and so let me just make a quick button with an on click event function check check doesn't really matter and here I'll go I'll set the body the background color to red okay and in here I should make a function called check which chosen all that this is height so let's save that and I'll just head over here to a program I use called web server for Chrome and here it basically allows you to host a file it allows you to host a folder from your computer as if it were a real website so I mean just open that up in this file hey I just paused it for a second and opened up my local host server here in Chrome other than Safari just work a little bit better okay so the first thing I want to do then here is start working on my HTML markup obviously I want to make a div that is gonna hold everything so that's inside the body let's make a diff I'm gonna give it a class I'm gonna call that a wrapper and then I'll close that div and then inside that div I'm gonna nest another div I'm gonna call that div box so what I'm doing is basically making a box with a box inside it so I'm nesting a div inside to do and inside that div called box I'm gonna make another div I'm gonna call it RGB and close that off okay and then underneath that div RGB I'm gonna make a button a button area with an unclick method that on click is gonna call a function called change color okay and then I'm gonna label I'm gonna add text that button saying change color and then I've got div closing div closing body and HTML so if I head over to my browser window I might hit refresh I see I've got this button to change color now my background is still red because I haven't change the CSS yeah okay so now the HTML is built the only thing we can see on the screen is obviously the button and the red background we set when we set the page up for testing so now let's um add some styling to this box div the first thing I'm gonna want to do obviously is wrap the box in a wrapper that fills the whole window and then I want to add some dimensions to the box itself and give it a border just make sure it's transparent inside and the text inside the box is centered and then finally I can add some styling to the RGB gloss so let's go ahead and get rid of the body here so the first thing we're gonna want to do is affect the wrapper so very simply let's just make it the width 100% so I'll take up the full width of your window and then I'll make the height or so 100% and then I want to take care of the box that's inside the wrapper so I make that width let's say 250 pixels make it the height rectangles or one over 75 pixels I'm gonna add a border border radius but I might look nice as well add a border of one pixel make it solid and color it black and then you know I'll add a border radius of 4 pixels make sure the background color of the box is transparent and align any text that's inside this box is gonna be aligned in the center of it and the last thing I want to do is style the RGB box I'm gonna make that margin margin:0 auto and I'm gonna call the font family so I'm gonna change the default font of this box I'm gonna make it something sans-serif because I personally don't like Sarah for Sarah there we go and there we go so that's our CSS styling taken care of and that's our HTML taken care of so now if I reload the page I have a button with a box with rounded corners that's inside to all intents and purposes another box that takes up the full width and height of this window so last thing obviously is to Kate care of the JavaScript so the first thing I'm going to want to do in JavaScript is go ahead and make the function that I call here in the HTML so here on the bottom element obviously on the on click I call change color at the moment it doesn't actually do anything so let's go over to the JavaScript and make a function called change color so now whenever I click that button in the index in the HTML like on the website it will call this function here in this function I'm gonna make a variable that calls another function and I'm gonna call that function make color so I'm going to call this variable new color and it's going to be calling a function called make color so basically every time I click the button in HTML it's gonna call this function in JavaScript and the first thing that's gonna happen in this function is it's gonna make a variable called new color that itself is a function I'm also going to make a variable under this that I'm gonna call box and this is basically going to be used to capture the box that I put here in HTML off the Dom so just realize actually class is wrong I'm also going to need to give that an ID of box and I'm also gonna need to give this one an ID of RGB a little tip that here that in HTML you can give an element as many classes as you want but you can only give it one ID so I could call this class RGB test hello it so I can give it as many classes I want but I can only give it one ID so back here in the JavaScript I'm gonna call this variable box and inside I'm gonna write document so I'm accessing the page get elements element by ID and I'm now telling it that I want to access the box element back here in HTML I've given this div the idea of box so here I'm saying get me the element on the document with the ID of box okay and I'm gonna then access the style of that box and the background color background color and I'm going to make the background color of this box whatever is in this variable so at the moment it's nothing but it will become clear next thing I'm also gonna do I'm also going to call document yet element by ID and this time I'm gonna take the RGB element and I'm gonna give it inner HTML also is gonna be new color so you'll see it I mean in a minute what this is actually going to do so let's move on to the next step let's go ahead and build the make color function so once again I'm going to write out function make color and open it up so in here I'm gonna do the variable called AR and put an empty array in there I'm now gonna write a for loop zero I is less than three I plus plus okay so what I've done is I've made a variable called ARR which holds an empty array and I've made a for loop that's gonna count to three if you've guessed by now that's because in RGB colors you need three different numbers to make up an RGB color so that's what I'm going for and inside this loop I'm gonna make a very important um it's gonna be calling basically an inbuilt JavaScript function called math.random so this variable here called num is basically holding a function inbuilt to Java school called math.floor which removes any decimal points inside that I'm calling math.random which picks a random number and I'm telling it instead of giving me a zero or one give me any number between 0 and 256 and then I want to push whatever number comes out into the array that I've made above this for loop so again I've got an MD array I then have a for loop that runs three times so it's gonna run once and it's gonna make a random number and put it in num and then it's gonna push it into the array and it's gonna do it once more and then it's gonna do it once more again so by the end of this part of the function running I'm gonna have an array with three cells that have three different numbers inside of it so outside of the array I'm gonna make a variable called new RGB and this is now going to be a string made up of just plain text and JavaScript code so it's gonna be RGB open brackets plus ARR which is our array at point zero plus a comma plus AR at point one plus another comma plus AR at point two so what I've done here is I've basically said start making a string called RGB and then open a bracket and then the first point in there I want to put whatever since L 0 of this array that's gonna be the first number , the second number comma and then the third number and then I would just want to go ahead and close up that bracket and then finish that variable and then I want to return this new RGB variable I've made and it's gonna be returned and go into new color so again a breakdown of how this JavaScript works when I click the button I call the change color function the change color function then makes immediately a new variable that calls the make color function make color function is run it makes a new variable inside of itself it runs through a loop three times making a random number each time the loop runs it puts a new number in each and cell of the array and then after the loop is finished running I make a new variable made up of a bit of string and then to the three numbers that I created and then I returned that new variable back to new color so essentially once this funk once this function might color ends itself whatever is in new color is going to be this new RGB variable and then I go on and I make an element called box out of our box on and on the HTML and I also access the RGB element on the HTML as well so moment of truth I go back to my browser and I refresh it and now if I click the button you see something has happened I have a color RGB 1 5 4 2 2 1 2 2 1 if I click it again we got another color I click it again I get another color they click it again I get another color so I can see here that my code I've written is working ok so now that I've got to this point what could I do in the future once my skills advanced a little bit so here's something actually made a little bit earlier in this format I'm controlling it by hitting the spacebar and not only am i returning to the user the RGB value I'm also returning to use at the hex value so if I hit space every time I hit space I get a brand new color and if I just open up the console as well I will be out to see if I say inspect on this body element but I can see immediately the background color is RGB 2 9 2 4 9 1 9 1 2 2 6 ok so there we have it we had a problem we needed a random color and then we came up with solution we wrote it in JavaScript how to make a random color on the computer so once again thanks a lot for watching it was really good fun making this tutorial it was a really good fun for me going back and also kind of relearning a little bit of vanilla JavaScript again so if you have any comments you'd like to leave me then please let me know below if you have any ideas for other tutorials you'd like to see me make then leave me a comment below I'll see if I can try and do it and if you like this video again please go ahead and subscribe thanks a lot and see you next time
