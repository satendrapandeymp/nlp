what the fudge is up everyone welcome to your fortieth html5 tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be learning about transformations not transformers like the movie a lot of those pretty good movie but transformations and what I mean by that is how to move our canvas around how to rotate it scale it shrink it translate it ooh pretty cool huh so it sounds interesting and trust me it is so before we start moving this canvas around it would probably be nice if we could have you know something pretty to look at so I'm not going to draw a basic shape because when we do something like flip a square upside down it looks the exact same so that really isn't the best way to demonstrate this so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be adding some text on the screen so canvas font and set this equal to bold 22 pix Tahoma not - hope mom - home mom and then after that let's see let's go ahead and align this to the start so text align start and now canvas fill text we want some thick nice text and what do we wanted to say let's just go ahead and since I'm going to be making a bunch of different transformations all right start and then you'll know well I'll show you guys in about half a second this is basically going to be the starting point it just says the word start and it's 10:30 not the time 10:30 over 10 and down 30 so that's basically our starting point and I'm going to go ahead and move the canvas around but that will always stay there so now let's go ahead and learn about these silly crazy transformations the first transformation I want to tell you guys about is simply how to move the canvas so whenever you're applying a transformation to a canvas you go ahead and write canvas because that's where you're going to do - and then you write the name of the transformation translate now my translate means is basically move they should have named this move but they didn't so this function takes two parameters the first one is the x value and the second one is the Y value so whenever we do this we're basically saying move the canvas 100 pixels to the right and 150 pixels down x and y so now all we have to do is well I guess it would be good if we actually had something to write after that so we'll just write canvas fill text and I'm just going to go ahead and copy this piece right there and what can we write right here like after translate so let me go ahead and save this in refresher and check it out my star is right here where it was but my translate this little piece after translate the text is now down here so even though we're writing both the text at ten-thirty let me just go ahead and actually change this to 0-0 so now whenever you raise something is 0 0 it's in very top leftmost corner so check it out the canvas is like right around here I know you guys can see the border of it but basically we took the entire canvas and moved it over 100 and down 150 and that's this point right here so that is how you translate or move a canvas and I know you guys are saying ok Bucky if you move the whole canvas then why the heck is a start right here shouldn't they be kind of overlapping well the reason the start is up here still is because computer programs work from the top down it follows order one by one so we're basically saying okay we made a canvas and whenever we make it by default it's in the top left right here so we're saying okay on our canvas draw start at 10:30 so it went over 10 down 30 and add roof start and then its next mission was to move the canvas 100 150 so it took the canvas and then moved it down here but this didn't move with it that job is already done the computer program is done with that piece it doesn't like go back and fix things it works from the top down so now that the canvas is over here whenever we write something at 0 0 then it just pretty much says ok the canvas is right here so 0 0 is now right here that's why I'm writing at right there so a lot of people confuse that they don't understand why start didn't move it's because computer programs they work from the top down it doesn't go back and fix its mistakes or anything like that so now we learn translate we got a couple more to cover the second one is canvas rotate now rotate takes one parameter and this is going to kind of freak you out let me just go ahead and write the number one in there now I know what you're probably thinking and actually let me go ahead and just copy this while I'm at it rotate fill text and I'll just write after rotates could spell like that if I want to so let me go ahead and refresh it and check it out whoa that looks like it rotated about like 45 degrees right around there well check it out even though I wrote one in here you may have been thinking it could take any value from like 0 to 360 because a perfect circle all the way around is 360 degrees but also the parameter it takes is a value in radians now Radian is kind of a weird thing and I don't know if you learn this in high school yet but if you don't know what radians are you just remember this 360 degrees equals I want to say 2pi but if you I guess if you don't know what radians are then you don't know like about 2pi and all that writing stuff but anyways it's basically like I can't think of the degrees like 57 degrees or something it's been a long time since I learned that stuff but I think it's like 57 degrees per Radian so anyways just remember if you're coming across your mistakes that this isn't degrees it's actually radians and if you want the conversion then you know don't listen to me go look it up it's somewhere around 57 or you know somewhere around there so now I want to tell you guys about one more thing and that is the scale so we go ahead and canvas and write scale then it's going to take two parameters the first value is the x-value and i'm just going to go ahead and write 1.5 and the second value is the y-value and I'm just going to go ahead and write 4 now whenever we give it a positive value like that what we're saying is okay I want you to scale this text 1.5 in the x-direction that means left and right I want you to grow it so it's basically if we looked at after translate it would basically stretch out to here now when we grow it in the y-direction it just means get taller so now this would be like this tall instead of this tall right here so now all you have to do is just go ahead and write the text on the screen and we should be good to go however if we write it right on top of this after rotate then it may be kind of hard to see everything so what I'm going to do is that I'm actually going to move this down 20 pixels and change this to after scale and whenever i refresh this it should be out of the way so check it out just go ahead and expand that paper right there so what we did is first we moved it down 20 pixels so that's why it isn't sitting right on top of after rotate after that we stretched it the x value if you notice it's a little bit longer than this after rotate even though scales are shorter were that's because we stretched it this way and we also stretch it in the Y value to grow taller so remember look at my mouse right now it's not up and down like you're vertically watching this since the canvas is rotated in this direction then that is the new x and y so y is now this and X is now this pretty sweet huh so actually the best way to learn all these stuff is basically to play around with it and the only thing you got to watch out for is these parameters because I mean typically you never talk about radians and you know a fraction whenever you're scaling things but there's just some little subtle tricks that you got to keep in mind but whenever we're making programs later on then I'm going to be clearing all that up as they come across them so stick with me and you'll be good to go so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
