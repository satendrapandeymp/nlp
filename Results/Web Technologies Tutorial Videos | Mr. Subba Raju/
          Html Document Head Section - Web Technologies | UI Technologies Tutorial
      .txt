hi guys welcome to nourish knowledge ease this is Subaru I am taking another video session on only header section in previous video session I discussed very clearly about HTML version information that is a doctype primary language language en - country name the next one is care set UTF - 8 Unicode transformation format in this video session will observe completely head section head is the logical part body is the visual part whatever the content we are implementing in the body section 90% visible this is the major difference you need to find first in the header section many elements available at least a few major related elements we can observe first one is a title second one is a meta third one is link fourth one is style fifth one is script etcetera these are the main commonly used head related elements of course elements popularly known as a tax related to title first I want to develop example almost all day to means second video onwards I am showing title tag to you so title tag I kept and the before you want to start doctype HTML it indicates the version information where version not available that is 5.0 and above if you are coming to any live environment website for example google comm control you view source code once you are entering in to view source code by pressing ctrl or you can zoom it and first line and first word available doctype HTML this is that so hereafter you can implement any kind of website or already implemented websites if you are going to observe observe that doctype HTML i made already very clear information regarding doctype come back to Google and Google information commonly Google homepage available and in this home page commonly we are observing images that is image under one text box some buttons available but there is nothing visible here header section means whenever you are increasing or decreasing at a section you can't see because header section is the logical part come down to our script and a header section header section contains title link meta script style first I am giving clarity about the title title tag is used to display the title of the HTML document there is number of characters wise there is no restriction but generally maximum up to 55 characters we can enter that is also not a rule that is such engine optimisation flexibility purpose we are using those characters but you can keep any number of characters suggestible below 20 it is not from w3c as per my experience I am suggesting below 23 20 characters better if title unable to display the end of the title three dots will be presented these three dots commonly we are calling as ellipsis ellipsis meaning is pure title unable to display or complete title unable to display if you mouse over to those three dots remaining title will be appear the meaning of that ellipsis now that ellipsis meaning you required I will show you practically title is a paid attack tax two types if you require that information go to second video now tax two types means paid tax non paid tax title is a paid tag peda tag means opening available as well as closing available that is paid tag closing always left side forward slash now title related example practically vacancy right already i developed without wasting our valuable time here and i developed i kept in front of you now if you want to apply here lang also you can apply not the mandatory because if you are not giving by default it is taking us english as accountable better all the rules if you are following to develop your website it is easily ranking occurred in the google or g ym body g ym means google yahoo msn these three members are maintaining yes Evo algorithm just can go to google and type about gy m or g ym related information you will get lot of algorithms implementation if you are related to osebo or SEM or digital marketing related guys definitely will get more information from these three characters that is Google Yahoo MSN right now MSN name is nothing but bingo comm older name is nothing but Windows Live calm now Ian - ini mentioned right and title I mention as usual save with dot HTML extinction and come to your web page right click and refresh yes title available nourish I technologies working with header related elements excellent now if you are coming back to our source code area again nourish IE technologies is there e is training and development organization I hope my intention you understood to display three dots nourish a technologies is a training and development organization now I am saving these lines and I am coming to my web browser I am refreshing by pressing control or refresh or f5 or any other shortcut key you can use commonly we are using refresh so complete title unable to display and nourish eye technologies easy pining after three dots you got these three dots I made ellipsis mouse over there then you are getting complete title so this is I said max 55 characters also it will show you but that is not a rule more than that we can keep better below 20 characters suggestible as per se rules now this is the title now if you are coming to an official website Google and another website nourish IT dot the in and nourish IT dot-com both websites I am showing from my mother company write nourish IT dot-com and nourish IT dot in both websites right observe Google just to Google display the beside there is a small image graphic image you are able to observe please observe that and if you come to best software training institute three dots available institute best online training institute hyderabad india right come to calm again mouse over there and you can observe welcome to nourish iit hyderabad register now for new batches neurotechnologies so these are the titles title behind there is a logo you observe you must not call logo that that is a fav icon favorite icon generally people are calling favicon it must be there in Nevada s with a web page or with website that graphic image is reflecting the business of the client so this graphic image how to prepare again what are the prerequisites are preconditions for that practically we can see if you are coming to a Facebook website there is AF similar vailable if you are coming to there is a snapdeal there is a SD available various various examples I am showing from live environment to understand easily this is F symbol if you are coming to worry closely that F symbol so now this favicon should be in four formats dot PNG portable Network graphics dot gif graphic interchange format dot ICO icon format dot SVG scalable vector graphics these are the recommended format images for the favicon favicon alias enemies URL icon or a website icon or shortcut image like this number of Elias names available favicon must be 16 by 16 pixels or maximum 32 by 32 pixels first always width next always height remember in entire our front-end technologies environment whenever one dimension I am interacting with you first width next height 16 pixels width by means into 16 pixels height maximum 32 pixels width into 32 pixels height so you must check your image within the dimension available or not once available we can integrate this favicon or this image as a favicon practically we can see that is with a link tag now title pot finished off title explanation completed now I am going to end attack that is called Li NK link link tag is used to link external resources to our HTML page how we are linking there is a syntax link is a non-paid attack non-paid tag having several alias names first alias name is self occlude tag means we are closing like this observe clearly li n k0 Singh is called a self o closer tag left side closing is called paid tag or or we are calling another name also the name is forcefully closer tag another name also is there MT tag another name also is their singular tag just these names I am providing for your better knowledge and better information anyone named you remember and you to write your source code now if you are coming back to link attack the syntax clearly mentioning here Li NK hypertext reference representing the path of the resource path of the resource in this video session these resource information I will show you what is global path what is a local path what is a file path what is a web a path what is a root related path in real-time industry what kind of a path the preferred for better web development definitely we'll see now HF after there is another attribute available Arielle that is called relation so whatever the document you are preparing this document related to HTML what kind of relation is also mandatory relation is nothing but the relation to the HTML doc docx meaning his document type always optional attribute but your better understanding purpose I am writing HTML 5 onwards type no need to mention even though type contains type of the source now here single quotation we can use double quotation we can use no quotation also it works practice purpose you can follow any one method but real-time industry purpose only double quotation recommended right as per real-time I am also changing right double quotation starting double quotation ending and upper whatever the path resource available double quotation starting double quotation ending again ending level and doctype also double quotation and relation is equal to double quotation this is the syntax perfect clear-cut syntax as per this syntax favicons how to integrate with our webpages as well as websites practically we can see now I am coming to my source code area just now we did nourish I technologies and keeping like that now I am giving after a title link tag HTML is not the case sensetive you can apply on any case but lower case visibility wise implementation wise always better link href equal to I am showing a small image html5 dot PNG relation Arielle is equal to exactly Icahn already made the point and what is the type of that it is image type by I 0 means extinction so extinction whenever I say maybe you are confusing sorrow tear dot PNG and type is equal to IC o---- saying any image extinction you must treat as IC bow that is the meaning of the syntax now all our single quotation opens single quotation only closed and I am coming to again my webpage my page and refresh observe left-hand side top of the corner clearly favicon you can able to observe it is something blur visibility is there because of I did jus that is a reason blur visibility available then doubt number one commonly here so how you know the image already 16 by 16 pixels or 32 by 32 pixels go to image right click properties observe the dimension no I added one image that contains 200 into 200 yes it takes 32 by 32 maximum better with the help of a logo designer you should design with the perfect dimensions you never get any kind of unavailability otherwise what happens sometimes it is not able to available but any image it displays now I didn't provided any path here no C Drive no D Drive no e Drive nothing simple I provided image resource only but now you are getting where this image stored my image and my HTML file both are in the same location that time we are calling as global path global path doesn't require any kind of address in the real-time implementation like this only we are followed but you want to follow your style I am showing your style now come to your hard disk environment click the pictures observe here number of pictures available with the picture folder double-click on that one these are my pictures some pictures are coming with Windows operating system some pictures I stored here now here one chrome dot PNG is there remaining all jpg all are any image just right-click any image in the sense I said only for extinctions jpg also will work out yes work out but not a recommended practice purpose you can practice any extinction but as per w3c standard some rules available we must follow those rules whenever we are following rules website getting easy ranking in the Google Yahoo MSN Bing etc go to properties once if you are going to properties chrome image the properties displaying copy that path completely once you are going to copy this path right click copy that come to your source code window whatever the source code available just paste that and add a backslash come back to your properties wizard and there chrome available copied extension dot PNG clearly visible to you portable network graphics right close that and that image I am pasting it yes file save come to our browser will run it so here html5 favicon should replace with my latest favicon CRO doing or not right to click refresh unable the reason one local path whatever the C Drive whatever the D Drive you are providing this local path some browsers unable to recognize right now I am using Firefox of a browser 49.0 one version it is a latest in the market firefox local path unable to recognize that time i am opening another web browser chrome right go to google chrome same path you can copy and paste there also yes hit chrome perfectly displayed means one browser supporting one browser not supporting that is a reason local path for real-time industry purpose not a recommended global path best local puppies a driver dependent comeback and whatever the path unable to display that time we are inserting file colon triple forward slash this is we are calling as file path file path partially recommended better try to avoid file path also but every browser supports now I am coming to Firefox yes refresh perfectly and I am opening even ie are opera safari any web browser all the browser's perfectly supports and here also Chrome I am using Firefox web browser Chrome favicon perfectly displayed right try on any web browser and whichever the web browser you are having doubt go there simply and paste it and refresh it here by default favicon available that is MSN right now I am coming back to my source code title completed link completed with the link favicon also completed the third part is the meta MGT a generally meta means immediately you people are thing meta data exactly correct but I am talking about meta is a tag tag formated Matt I am talking immediate you're thinking metadata correct it is a database related terminology please stay tuned with our HTML terminology that is meta meta means here meta data related to search engine related to search engine optimization only this meta is classified into more than 50 types 5-0 types among these five zero frequently we are using five to six very important the websites so that meta five types water one is keywords second one is a meta description third one is a meta title fourth one is a meta Cassatt in the last video session explained very clearly from unicode dot o-r-g website please refer the video and next one is a meta viewport finally meta author these are the meta elements commonly we are using in our websites so meta completely related to such engine optimisation now I want to write this meta related information before I am writing meta related information all meta tags are non-paid tags sell for close attacks empty tags forcefully closed attacks so these attacks implementation will observe right I am coming world number one website world a popular search engine google calm i am entering one key word here keyboard my keyboard elementary su BB a re a ju space sir my name elementary and enter it once you are pressing enter my mother organization coming first after that again in after that my photo also coming here then you should think one second what is Raju relation with Google if you are typing my name why Google displaying my photo type your name coming your photo not coming if coming there is a logic you know already if not coming you need to know what is the logic behind the logic is called meta relation between Google and my image what is that meta relation just right anyway you are seeing here photo now once the photo available go to my Nareesha technologies any website I am clicking narration say technologies software training course materials and available here once if you are clicking on that it is going to my organization yeah whenever you are entering my name in the google.com the related my mother Institute is opening on your screen so what is the relation means I made very clearly that is a meta relation now come back to again google.com just a minute once you are coming to google.com another keyword I am selecting for example now it is popularly you people are searching cricket a keyword once you are selecting the cricket keyword all the results in the Google coming to related to cricket even one website also not coming not related to cricket that means meta relation how much stronger available you can check it so every ever entered word is called meta keyword these are called meta results and whenever results are displaying every website after two lines are there this is a meta description if you are going to any website in this one just to click on one website once you are entering into the website control you view source code in the to view source code meta keywords meta description everything available control F find out keywords yes directly visible here just you can select that control C and control V total meta keywords visible to you yes perfectly so these many meta keywords those are maintaining observe these meta keywords nowhere other than cricket available all are related to cricket and then you will get it out how many keywords available like that is there any major number officially there is no major number but maximum any number of keywords we can keep but first 20 keywords are high priority as per the search engine optimization algorithm so more than 20 also you can keep now can we duplicate a keyboard more than one time yes duplicate there is no issue but a keyboard and keyboard duplicate keyword between at least another five to six other keywords must be there and a maximum one keyword you can duplicate only three times so like this meta keywords available you can type this keyboard on any search engine automatically this Yahoo is coming or the cricket results are coming now then you can ask another doubt here the doubt is only why ah who coming first place number of other websites also available no means it is a depends on number of users visiting on that website our number of clicks per a day based on that every day the ranking automatically changes maybe day by day ranking changes no website permanently first rank available as per google algorithm sometimes coming 1st 2nd 3rd 4th it depends on the completely traffic rate okay now this is meta keywords I made meta description so is this description available here yes will observe same in the same line meta description available ctrl-c and ctrl-v here all I am going to copy paste that and I am showing that right and goto directly that website starting checkout live cricket scores cricket news headlines is really available yes perfectly available check out a live cricket scores cricket news headlines all are and after ellipsis symbol means more available no need to display are unable to display like this Meta Description is possible so third one is meta title meta title available commonly if you come to nourish I technologies Institute control you view source code once you are entering I kept here meta name is equal to title once you can copy/paste that meta title control C and you can paste here and available clear information for you what a title available it is a meta title for the meta content what that one welcome to nourish IT Hyderabad register now for new batches this is a title we kept for such engines so this is a meta title here only meta author available meta author you want to view that just and I'm showing another website now because one one example I am providing one one area better just hollow keyword I entered several magazines are coming there is a popular website available hollow magazine calm this is world a popular website for latest news from United Kingdom just to control you view source code in that once you are hitting on view source code it is going see how many types of meta available complete a meta and in this meta they kept the event title also observe so you want to copy that and double click on that one meta title also available sometimes we can keep our username or who are developing this website they can also get so latest celebrity news royal updates daily headlines exclusives that is title and a meta author actual I need to show now meta author also that is only we are waiting for meta author and here author available hello is the author right that is also I am showing meta author so he is the Warner of that website and author available so this is meta author so almost all I said five to six last one is meta viewport when your website is developed on particular device purpose or responsive web related features that time available meta viewport also this meta viewport scale is equal to one representing by default this website mobile compatible also this is bootstrap onwards they implemented bootstrap is best mobile front-end framework to design better web application that is only we are calling a responsive responsive means cross device support cross a platform support cross browser support cross a technology support here cross means of multiple in separate video sessions definitely will observe bootstrap also this is a meta name is equal to viewport so I explained to you meta keywords meta description meta title meta author meta viewport meta charset in the last video session already completed so title tag finished link attack finished meta tags finish more meta tags in advanced video session cell discus and next one is a script attack scripted tag also commonly we are writing within the header section I said already had a section always contains a logical part script a tag by default represents JavaScript whenever you are writing JavaScript we are writing script type is equal to text or JavaScript and you are writing language is equal to JavaScript here these two attributes are not a compulsory because by default JavaScript in the web environment that is a reason if you write or not writing also nothing of acted only script tag enough it is script because it is a paid tag script in middle statements available JavaScript related statements we are writing statements every statement ends with semicolon and regarding JavaScript information in separate video sessions available related to JavaScript soon you will enjoy those video sessions also now script type is equal to and the language is equal to double quotation single quotation but quotation composite is no kodesh it won't work out after that one finally why actually script tag we are using to validate forms HTML forms or a data information whatever the characters we are entering to validate all these things JavaScript we are using javascript is forever evergreen in the IT industry at the presentation layer level no JavaScript the knowledge no future no feature in the web environment if you are related to any technology JavaScript or mandatory on the basis of JavaScript right now in IT industry more than 100 frameworks are working means one JavaScript perfectly you know ja guarantee that is the capability of the JavaScript finally last tag available style style tag is there and style clothes style means we can apply cascading style sheets to our HTML documents what is the meaning of cascading inheriting what is the meaning of style collection of properties what is the meaning of sheet dot CSS extension cascading style sheets these are the Styles we are adding to our HTML documents it is also a paid tag these are representing CSS part here also there is an attribute available type is equal to text or CSS text or CSS we are calling as my type and inside styles available and styles and semicolon and this is the syntax it is also painted this is header section almost our most important elements in the head section in this video session you are able to understand thank you for watching my videos catch me for more videos in youtube.com slash narration
