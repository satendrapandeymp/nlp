we're going to continue along with JavaScript syntax and we've been talking a lot about functions and so far we've just been passing information into our functions and so this six would go into the X and the five would go into the Y and then they would be multiplied and in this case the function would write out the result which of course is our variable and if we ran this this would be written out to the browser the key point here is the function is doing this and the other point is that we're only sending information into the function but what if we want to send information back to where we called the function from and that is done with the return statement and so again we can send information into a function and we can also have the function return information and that's what we're going to cover in this video so we use the return statement so let's go ahead and get rid of this document dot right because we're not going to have the function do this now we're actually going to use a return statement here so I'll copy and paste that in here and so now what will happen is the value that we got after we multiplied this will be returned to whatever called the function and in this case of course we called it right down here when we specified the add function now we could just return it to here but let's actually return this to a variable and so let's make a variable here and I should also point out that you don't have to necessarily just specify the function name to call a function variables also can call functions also and we had actually done that in earlier videos so again you don't have to just specify the function name you can actually create a variable and the variable can call into the function so I'll show you that now so let's type in the variable keyword we'll call this variable the result and of course we'll have to use the equals operator and there you can see now we've got a variable and it's kind of doing the same thing right we're actually going to call it but we're doing it with a variable and so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and run this and we didn't get anything and I expected that and I'll explain why and the reason is we didn't do a document dot write but before I get to that let's actually walk through what happened again the variable called the function and we did the same thing as when we we just used the function name before we passed in a 6 & a 5 it came in through our parenthesis and then it was multiplied right here and here's where it's a little bit different again we returned the result back to the variable so we sent something back we sent the value back to the result variable that called the function in the first place so the value of this now is actually 30 now the reason we didn't see that is because we need to do something with this variable now right we didn't do anything with this variable so let's actually go ahead and write this out and so if we go ahead and do a document dot write and we'll write out the variable let's go ahead and save this and now we should get the result of 30 and there you see we got the expected result so again all you're doing when you use the return keyword is you're sending something back to whatever called the function in the first place okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
