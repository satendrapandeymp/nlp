hey YouTube how's it going its Quinton here and in this tutorial I am going to talk to you guys about all different kinds of buttons and we're going to be able to use in HTML okay so there's actually quite a few that we're going to have to get through so I'm going to start off real quick with the first button which is just a plain button that actually doesn't do anything until you use JavaScript or some sort of client-side scripting language to UM add some events to that button okay in other words make that button do something so to add a button onto our web page we add an input element and I'm going to give that a type of button and this will make sure that the tag over here is rendered out as a button then I'm also going to give this button a value and the only reason I'm going to give this button a value is because the value determines what shows up on the button so it is actually very different to all the other elements that we learned about in the past whereas the value represents the like actual information that is stored in that element okay with a button that isn't the case with a button whenever you're working with the value this is going to be whatever is displayed back to the user on that specific button so I'm going to just say I am a button and now I'm going to have a button that says I am a button okay and if I run this in Firefox then I can see I've got a button over here that says I am a button and when I click on it absolutely nothing happens okay so these are made more for JavaScript and if you're using javascript and you want the user to be able to click on something and activate some sort of function or code then they can go ahead and do that but if the user isn't going to be clicking on anything or if you're not going to be using client-side scripting languages then this button is not really what you're looking for okay the next button I'm going to show you guys is going to be the button that you click to upload a file and it doesn't actually have a type of button in fact I might have I should have probably given this its own tutorial but it would be way too short and I'm going to give this an input type of file and this is going to render out as a button that we can click to upload a file so I'm going to save this now and go back to Firefox and click refresh and as you can see I have my second button over here and next to that it says no file selected and basically if I click browse then I can you know just find something that I want to upload and there we go I can upload that file and this is going to be kind of different because we not really going to want to change the wording that appears here so we're not going to work with the value or anything like that but what you could do is work with the size and you could make it longer than it should be so a size of 50 would then just make the actual size of this space that the text can appear over here much longer okay so in other words if we had a really long filename then this these words over here would just extend for that size of 50 okay so I'm just going to leave that blank we should probably add in break tags just for display purposes make everything appear on a new line and the next button I'm going to show you guys is also an input and we're going to give that a type of submit and to be honest or we can to be honest I was going to say we're going to have to add in the next button right at the same time but I'll work on that okay so let's give this a value quickly of submit and a submit button is the button that you click on to say okay I am finished filling in this form I want to send the data back to the server so that is what a submit button is for and the next button that I want to add in here real quick is going to be a reset button so just copy that and paste this and a reset button actually resets the form so I'm going to give this a value of reset and we're going to take a look at these two buttons in just a moment but there is something I'd like to do here so let's click refresh right now there is no data to submit because we don't have any other form elements and there's no form elements to reset either so these two buttons aren't really going to do anything for us just yet but let's go ahead and actually add some more elements onto our page okay and I think we could probably just comment this button out so Oh actually I'm going to delete it there's no point okay so I'm just going to add a few more elements onto my page so I'm going to pause the recording and I'll be right back okay so what I did was I added in an input of type text where I'm asking the user for their name I added an input type password where I'm asking the user for a password and I added three check boxes that don't actually do anything but they just have numbers next to em 1 2 or 3 and the user could tick one of those options but those aren't really important which is why I did that off and if we click refresh over here you can see I now have my input elements and my actual checkboxes and that's actually kind of annoying that I didn't put a brake tag over here so I just want to do that not that changes much but there we go that appears on a new line so let's take a look at what this submit and reset button do so I'm going to fill in my name and let's fill in a password one two three four five six seven actually and I'm going to tick some of those checkboxes and we can maybe select a file over here so pictures and I will pick select a picture of a car so there we go we now have some data fold into our form but now what happens when I click reset well all of that data gets reset so it gets deleted the form appears as if it had never been filled in before so that is what the reset button does but if I fill some of the starter back in again so password one two three four five and we'll tick some of these boxes just select the file here again when I click Submit you'll notice that the web page is actually going to refresh real quick so let's click Submit and there we go it's asking me if I once you save my password because Firefox does that but what actually happened here was I sent all that data that was full into this form back to this same page so remember when I spoke to you guys about the action and the method well that comes into play here because whenever we click on that submit button all that data gets sent back to whatever page was in our action and because we left our action blank all that information got sent back to this specific page now you might be asking well where is it well because we send that data through using the get method we can actually see all that data and if you take a look right up here in the top of my URL or at the end of my URL I now have a name so it says name is equal to Quinton and password is equal to one two three four five checker is equal to 1 and checker is equal to 2 so coincidentally the name of my name happens to or the name of my text input happens to be name so you can see that when I fold in Quinton into this name I send through the name of name and the value of Quinton and my password well the past the name of my password seems to be password so that's correct and I typed in the value of 1 2 3 4 5 so I sent through a value or name of password and a value of 1 2 3 4 5 so that's just basically how forms work I know it's kind of been a little bit of a mystery up until now up until we learned about the submit button but I hope that clears everything up for you guys and I hope you can finally see how forms work so that's all I have for you guys in this video as always don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
