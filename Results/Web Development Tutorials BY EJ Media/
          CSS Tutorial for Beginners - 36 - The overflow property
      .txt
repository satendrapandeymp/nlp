in this tutorial we are going to look at the overflow property and I've set up just a couple of content panels here that hold a couple paragraphs as you can see and let's just go ahead and take a look at these right now and there you can see we have two paragraphs in each one of our main content panels now the current state of these is that they do not have a height and width so they will naturally expand to whatever we put inside there in this case text but let's change things up what we're going to do is we'll keep this one the same but in our second content panel we will add a fixed height so let's go ahead and do that and we'll say height equals 120 pixels so let's save the stylesheet and let's open this up and you can see now since we fix this second content pane at a hundred and twenty pixels the text starts rolling off of it because we said stop here at 120 but the text continues to roll off of here so that's where the overflow property comes into play we can actually tell the browser to do a couple things when an event like this happens so let's close this out and let's use the overflow property so all we do is type in overflow and of course we need a colon now there's a couple different options that I like to use here the first one is to set up a scrollbar so all we have to do is put in the parameter scroll we hit save here and there you can see we have a nice scrollbar that is inserted now and this is handled properly so that's one parameter that you can use now you can also hide the text and in that event you just use the parameter hidden so let's save this and if we open this up now you can see the text is hidden so that's another strategy that you can take now you can also actually set up inheritance with the overflow property like you can do with any property so we could stick this up here in the body section and then all of your child elements would have this what I like to call Auto healing mechanism in case something goes wrong okay that is going to do it for this tutorial
