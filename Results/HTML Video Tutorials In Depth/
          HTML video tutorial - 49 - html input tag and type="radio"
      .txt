hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series in this tutorial I am going to discuss radio buttons how we create radio buttons and when we need to create radio buttons answer to the second question that is when we need to create radio buttons if user need to make only one selection out of multiple choices then we need to create radio buttons for example in an application form if we are accepting gender of an applicant in front of him there will be two choices either male or a female out of which he need to make only one choice right then in that situation we need to create radio buttons let's take one more example if we are asking a question to the user or applicant are you physically challenged there will be two choices yes or no out of which he need to make only one choice either yes or no in that situation we are going to create radio buttons let's see practically how we create radio buttons that is answer to the first question let me double click on default dot HTML right click on the default dot HTML open with the notepad you can see in the previous tutorial we understood how we create password fields and text box in this form I want to accept gender so I create one paragraph say here gender closing paragraph tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that gender got displayed let me go back to notepad I put here colon to create radio button we are going to use input tag so I write here I NPO T input as input is an unpaid tag I am going to write forward slash greater than sign inside that I have to write type attribute and I need to give here value to create a text box we have given the value text to create a password field we have given password then to create a radio button we have to give radio file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has created a radio button but we should tell to the user for what this radio button is meant for right so I need to write some text I am going to write here the text as a male this radio button is meant for male file save go to browser refresh you can see that male text got displayed in front of the radio button or beside the radio button I need to create one more radio button so I use input then I say type equal to in double quotation I say radio forward slash greater than file save go to browser refresh you can see that one more radio button got displayed now I need to tell for what this radio button is meant here I am going to say female this radio button is related to female or with respect to female file save go to browser refresh now we have radio button then mail text then we have radio buttons I need to give names to these radio buttons right let's proceed I say here name equal to here I am going to say our DB that is a prefix RDB mal email then I have to give ID ID is equal to in double quotation I am going to write the same value our day be male we know that name and ID are used to uniquely identify this control and access this control into code let me hit enter and put this down I am going to give name here also name is equal to our DB female then I have to give ID is equal to in double quotations I am going to put our DB female I copy this and paste here file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have male and female radio buttons I need to select only one radio button out of this let me try that if I click on the male then this should be deselected that is correct only if I click on this this should get deselect but it is not getting D selected the reason is this radio button is independent of this this radio button is independent of this if you want to get the proper behavior then I need to group these radio buttons if we need to group these radio buttons what we need to do we have to give same value to the name attribute that means instead of saying our daily mail our day be female I need to write here our day be gender it is name meant for gender right I am written I have written here our D be gender I copy this same I give here same I give here same I give here the name value must and should be same our day be gender our day be gender now what happens means these two radio buttons are going to be grouped under a single name our day be gender this time you will see file save go to browser refresh observe that both are deselected in the beginning by default that's okay if I click on this it got selected and this is deselected if i click on this you can see that this got d selected now they are in group if i select one the other will get deselect this is how you can group get the proper behavior and also you might have observed when i first time loaded both were in d selected more we can give default selected mode by using the attribute called as check the CH e cked check files say what we are telling when I load the page by you fault this radio button should be checked or selected file save go to browser refresh okay you can see that it is not selecting it is remembering the previous value even though I said here CH e cked checked let me load I save this and close the browser and open this default dot HTML once again let's see now what happens you can see that mail is selected if i click on female this got d selected if i click on this female god is selected similarly next attribute i am going to use is a value here also i am going to add an attribute VA lue value in double quotation i have to give here values i am not going to put them empty because when i access this RDB gender in the code it is going to return me the value understanding here I can write the complete name itself like male or I can simply write the short form M and then here I write F M indicates male F indicates female when I access this these this radio button group value our day be gender dot value whichever is checked that radio button value will be returned back hope you guys are understanding file save go to browser refresh if I select female and submit the form F will be returned in the core if I select the male and submit the form M will be returned by this our DB gender in the core this is how you can create a radio button and radio group and the situation where you can use the radio button one example I can give one more example also for example I can say I copy this paste it down and I ask a question to the user are you physically challenged question mark then I am going to create two radio buttons here I am going to say R baby question are let me put at present just question qu est iy n question r DB question just a generic name I am giving here same value I am going to give here ID also I'm going to give same here here also I'm going to paste the same thing and the value I am going to give here is y for s n for no and by default this one I have checked but usually I'm going to put no no radio button should be checked by default so I have here the attribute check and here I am going to put the text yes then here I'm going to put the text no file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have a question are you physically challenged by default we have here no if I click on yes then you can see that no god this selected no radio button you can see I am getting the proper behavior also this is how you can group now these two radio buttons are in one group because these two radio buttons have the same name our day be question RDB question these two radio buttons are in one group because they have the same name our day be gender our day be gender hope you guys have understood how we can create radio buttons and when we create radio buttons for this tutorial this much is enough
