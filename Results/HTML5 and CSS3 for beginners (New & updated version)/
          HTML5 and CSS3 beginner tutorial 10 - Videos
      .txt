hey YouTube how's it going it's Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 10 and in this video I'm gonna show you guys how to use the video tag in HTML so if you ever want to add a video to your website then this is how you do it so jump over to your text editor and you can see right now I've cleared everything out so my browser is blank and I'm gonna add a video to my website by opening up a video tag now this is a new tag in HTML so it's it's new to html5 fortunately though html5 has been around for quite a long time now and it should actually be supported by most browsers but just in case somebody's using a computer that's like 10 years old and they're using Internet Explorer and they've never updated Internet Explorer this video tag would probably not work for that person so you know the number of people who this applies to is hopefully by now very very small but let's just add in a message yet to say this if you can see this if you can see this update your browser right so basically this message should only display if the user has a really old out-of-date browser and a really old computer so let me save this and hit refresh in my browser and as you can see the message isn't showing up that means my browser at least supports html5 and it supports this video tag so I'm good to go and I'll continue by adding some more information here so inside of the video tag I want to add another tag by the way whenever you add a tag within a tag that's called nesting and we're going to do that quite a lot in future videos so I thought I just mentioned the term but let me add another tag over here called sauce and and the source tag basically lets you set a source for the videos we get to decide what video we want to add to our website now if I take a look at my htdocs folder over here I wonder if I just zoom in this way if again if they get bigger nice now I don't have to edit that so I've got my index file and then I've also got this video called storm clouds mp4 now make sure that whatever video you're trying to add is an mp4 because mp4 is supported by most browsers if you're trying to add a video that is not an mp4 chances are good it's not gonna work so make sure that it is an mp4 and then what you can do is just go ahead and grab that file name or if your folder in your videos away.he make sure you use the correct file path but seeing as my video and my HTML document are in the same directory I'm just going to copy that name paste it in here and then for type I'm gonna set this equal to video slash mp4 right so the type is just to specify what type of video it is but we know that most videos that work I mean most browsers only support mp4 so we're gonna specify a type of mp4 and we're gonna make sure that we're using an mp4 if you're using something else I think the only other ones that are supported are OGG and WebM and even those are only supported in some browsers and not in others so just make sure that you're using an mp4 it's the safest way okay so now let me go ahead and save this and jump back over to the browser and hit refresh and you can see I've got a video showing up but it is rather large so this was a video of me in Germany and there were some storm clouds come in its actually on my blog channel if you want to check it out but let me just add a few more attributes to this video to make it fit the page and also to make the video play because right now you know I'm clicking on the video it's not playing how do I get this video to play let me show you right so for in the video tag I'm going to add an attribute called width and what that is going to do is determine the width of our video so I'm going to set that equal to 600 then I'm going to also add an attribute for height and I'm going to set that equal to 340 so 600 by 340 used to be the old YouTube standard so that's how I know this video should fit so let me come back here and hit refresh okay so now the video fits inside of the browser but I still can't play it how do I get this video to play well we can come back to the text editor and add an extra attribute here called controls and that doesn't have to be set to anything so you don't have to have an equal sign as long as the word controls appears in the tag we should now get some controls appearing in the browser so let me come back here and refresh and now I've got this beautiful set of controls below my video so if I hit play then my video actually plays and obviously pause and I've got some volume controls etc etc I can also make it fullscreen so yeah the default controls are pretty good whoopsie yeah I messed my my window up now I've got to resize it again okay so that is how you add a video with controls but there are a few other attributes I want to talk about and so let me just grab my list over here there is another attribute called autoplay which if you specify this as long as autoplay is set as a value over here whenever you open this web page in your browser it will automatically play the video so let me hit refresh ok so now whenever the the page opens the video plays right so yeah that is somewhat its useful in some cases but it can be annoying in others so you need to decide when you want a video to play automatically or not but yeah the autoplay options are them then there is another option or another attribute that we can add called loop and this does precisely what you think it does it loops the video so let me remove autoplay save this go back to the browser refresh and I'm gonna play the video but when the video gets to the end it's gonna loop so so yeah now that the the video reached the end it looped and that is because we have the loop attribute set if that's not set the video will not loop over and over again okay so let me take that out and then I want to talk to you guys about another attribute that you can set which is muted and obviously if you set this and you you run it in the browser the video will automatically be muted so you can see the the symbol there is down I'm playing the video there's no sound as soon as I click on the microphone it's now unmuted so you can control all these sorts of things by just adding in an extra attribute in the the opening tag of your video and by the way if you're following along with this tutorial and your videos not showing up or you you can't figure out what the problem is just make sure to validate your code so if you let me make a mistakes that the video doesn't show up I'll purposefully make a spelling mistake in the video name come back over to the browser refresh oh now you can see the video is not displaying because well I made a spelling mistake in the name right but if you're ever trying to figure out what your error is go over to the HTML validator I will leave a link in the video description browse find that HTML file that you've been creating and upload that to the HTML validator and just check to see what your error is because if you made a typo in your video name it will be oopsie let's check this again maybe it's because I have a video set but it should actually tell me that I've made a mistake not Oh okay so if you upload your file and hit check it should tell you if you've made some kind of a mistake service not available what the hell it just it literally just works let me hit refresh here I can okay so check that's taking time okay there we go for some reason those websites got issues today but there we go if you check your file in an HTML validator it'll give you the error so bad value storm-clouds attribute source on element sauce illegal character in path segment space is not allowed so I used the space that's bad and yeah bad bad value because it couldn't find the actual video so let me go ahead and correct that and save this and now if I jump back over the browser and i refresh you can see that the video showing up again but if I test this in a validator I should not have any errors hopefully it works this time please bad okay so so it seems for some reason this the site is down that's not good but let's try again okay there we go document checking completed no errors to show awesome so that is how you add a video to your website and that is all I have for you and I'll see you next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks until the end
