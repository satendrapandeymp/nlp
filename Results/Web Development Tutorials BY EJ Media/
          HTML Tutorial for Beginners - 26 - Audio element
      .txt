in this video we're going to discuss the audio element tag that is new to html5 now in this era of digital media HTML has caught up with the times and they provided easy ways to put audio and video files onto your web page and in this video we're going to discuss the audio element tag now you will need an mp3 file to follow along with this lecture or a WAV file or a dot OGG file and you'll want to copy that to the same folder where your index.html is located now you'll see here I've placed a comment in the HTML source and I've just said the three standard formats are mp3 wav and dot ODG but probably you'll want to use mp3 that is pretty much the standard format these days and you can see here here is the audio element tag and is just like any other tag you need to have an opening tag and a closing tag now there are several attributes but the main attribute that you absolutely have to use is the controls attribute and you can see I've placed that right here and that will basically place a nice control on our webpage where we can play whatever mp3 we want to play and you can pretty much put any name you want in here I just made this audio controls inside the audio element tag is the source element tag and this is where you can specify your audio file and here's the source attribute and you can see here I've just pointed to the test1 dot mp3 now you can actually take this source attribute and just put it right up here if you want you could do that and if you feel pretty confident that your file will be supported for all the browser's you can do that but if you want to have multiple versions of your audio file in other words if you want an mp3 a dot wave and a dot o GG version you need to use the source element tag and so let's go ahead and do that even though we don't have a dot wave and we'll just copy and paste this in here and we'll just make this wav e Boop's dot wav sorry about that now the way this works is if for some reason the browser can't load the dot mp3 version it will try and go ahead and load the dot wav version that's the way this works and even though we don't have a dot wav version in here you probably should do that and that's just a good standard operating procedure even though most of the browser's today support all the different flavors that are out there it's always a good idea just in case and there several audio conversion tools out there where you can convert your audio files so that being said let's go ahead and save this let's open up our browser I'm going to use Google Chrome and there you can see we have this nice control and once again if we didn't have this attribute here this would not appear so let's go ahead and hit play this is an audio test for our test one dot mp3 oh my isn't that just an awesome voice who is that I wonder okay I have a horrible sense of humor I know in any event that is the audio element tag now there are other different types of attributes that we can use with the audio element tag and we will discuss that in the next video
