so we talked about in the last video the form element tag which is right here and this again just acts as a container to put in whatever input fields we want and the input field we made in the last video of course was this one line text box which is formed by the input element tag and also declaring the type as text and that gives us again this one line text box but now we want to actually add some labels to these text boxes because people need to know what information they're entering and so let's say we needed a first name and a last name so that's what we're going to do we're going to create our first label for this first text box and we're going to ask for the first name so I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste what I already typed out and I'll explain it so here's the label element that's how we declare a label and notice we have to close this one out so we close that out with a closing label tag before I'll explain this in a second and here is where we put in our text first name and this is what will be displayed on the page now we have to tie this label to this input element and we do that with this four attribute and you can give this any name you want we called it first name and then we have to create another attribute in our input element and that is again ID so we type in ID and then equals and then first name and so again this name right here has to match this four attributes the four attribute has to match the ID attribute and that's what ties these two together so let's go ahead and refresh our webpage and there you can see we've got our first name label right here what's really neat about this too is when you use this label element and you click on the text let's do that we click on the text you can see the control is automatically highlighted if we click on the text now if this was just normal text it wouldn't highlight this one line text box so that's what's kind of cool about using this label element and so let's just go ahead and copy and paste this code for our second box here and we'll just rename this to second name or actually you know what more appropriately we'll call it last name because that's what it's going to be and then let's take this ID here and we'll just copy and paste this right here and it this ties our label to our input element and we'll call this last name and so let's go ahead and refresh everything up here and well we forgot to actually make the text last name so let's do that really quick and we'll refresh this again and there you see we've got two text boxes now with labels in which we can collect information from our user this will be submitted to a server where we will process that data and again if we click on the text it highlights the text box that's really kind of a nice attribute about this label element okay so that's going to do it for this video in the next video we'll actually do a multi-line text box see you guys
