so in this video I want to show you how to create a grid of images when you finish we're going to end up with something that looks like this when you roll over these you'll notice that the opacity changes a little bit and we get a little bit of a border come in we want this to be centered in the middle of the page like this so we're going to write the CSS for that I'm going to start off by just deleting what I have right now and showing you the HTML so save that and come over here see that my HTML is pretty easy just a basic HTML page and then I have a div with an ID of image list and in there I have a series of images with an anchor tag wrapped around them the anchor tags have a link or a clickable to the larger version of the photos there's an images folder right here and in that images folder I have a thumbnail version of the image which is a 75 by 75 pixel image then I have some larger versions so if I go through these you can see the small ones and the large ones so if we look at the HTML the images are essentially an anchor tag that have an image tag inside it looks something like this so in in the href I place a link to the high resolution version right high rest and then on the image then it's linked to the low resolution version and I definitely have to have an alt tag so I'll have an alt tag in there but pretty simple HTML just repeated a few times for each one of the images so let's go ahead and dig into our CSS file I'll start off with the body tag and in the body tag I'll first start by setting up the background image and we'll do that by just linking to the image in the images folder and it's called wooden jpg and that file is right here it's called just a wood background it repeats so we want to make sure we take off all this other junk so when you finish with it it should look like this notice that there's a little bit of spacing to the left on the top of the image grid that's because the body of a regular page always has a little bit of a margin and a padding attached to it will clear those out so we'll set the margin and padding to zero I'm going to target my image list and I'm going to show you how to get rid of that little space it's kind of a trick we can set the font size to zero that gets rid of that spacing in between if I wanted to Center three of those images in the middle of the page then I know that each of these images is 75 pixels so 75 times 3 is 225 so I can set the width of this thing right here to to 25 pixels that gives me a three image grid and to Center it I need to set the margin to zero and auto margin zero here means at the top and bottom I want no margin and on the left and right I want the browser to calculate the width of the margin automatically what the does is Center this grid of images within the browser width let's start get the image list anchor tag and what I'm going to do there is add a margin of two pixels that gives me a little bit more breathing room between the images but now it's kind of breaking up our with over here that's again because we're setting it to 225 and 225 is the width of 3 without any sort of margin so we have to add our margin and let's go and pull up my calculator and 75 pixels plus 4 because it's two on each side equals 79 times 3 is going to be 237 so if I do 237 here it will not work 237 and now we've got the three images side-by-side so whenever you calculate width you got to add up not just the width of the image but the width of the image plus the margin let's go ahead and add a border see what happens so border 4 pixels solid and then we'll just give it a color so a couple of weird things are happening notice that there is nothing no text in here so it's collapsing the border and it's also screwing up our width once again so we're going to have to recalculate the width with this additional border let's go ahead and do that first since we just did this so let's clear this out 75 pixels plus 4 for the margins plus 8 is 87 times 3 for 3 images is 261 just modify this to 261 but we still have that other weird little problem with the anchor text now it doesn't actually matter these things are still clickable it's just that the borders are collapsing to the height of the text which there is no text in there so so I need to change the display eight of these things to inline-block that will fix the other problems you now everything looks pretty nice and next I want to go ahead and make the border this border right here I want to change it whenever somebody hovers over the image so I'll do image list anchor and then hover so when somebody rolls over one of those images I want to change the border color to white and that will do a nice kind of rollover effect but now I don't really want to see this border whenever the image is not being hovered over so I could just sort of get rid of this border here but something weird will happen so you can see this actually became smaller and that's really not what we want we don't want the spacing to go away we so I'll just set this color to transparent and that's actually a color in CSS and that leaves the space for the rollover and the rollover changes the color to white let's work on our image borders I want my image borders to be rounded so to do that I'll have to use border radius and I can do ten pixels and that makes the edges round now look what happens now when I roll over the edges of my borders are still square so that looks a little bit funky so let's go we need to go ahead and add this border radius onto our anchor tags right so let's do that and that looks better but there's sometimes like a little bit of a hole here so what I'm going to do is just make this one have less of a less of a border radius so we'll do six pixels there and now it looks pretty good I think whenever you use some of these css3 attributes like border radius you have to make sure you try to be as compatible with older browsers as possible so to do that we actually have to have some prefixes if you go to this website you can see it gives you all the different prefixes for the different rules so border radiuses are not as bad we just have to include WebKit border radius but on some things like transitions or transforms you have to add prefixes for WebKit which is Safari and Chrome Moz which is Firefox MS which is Microsoft or Internet Explorer and which is opera so and then the regular version of the CSS so to do this properly we would have to make sure we add WebKit WebKit border-radius and then we add the same rule and we'll do the same thing down here so let's work on the opacity of these images here what I'm going to do is on my anchor tag I'm going to set the opacity right here to be let me get 0.5 so that makes it not be as opaque and I can modify that on hover of course I'll make the opacity one so that's a number from zero to one and now they when you roll over them they become very visible it would be actually cooler if we animated that transition so to do that you would use the transition attribute and again this is a css3 rule so we can say this means change everything and then you give it a timing attribute here so three point three seconds and then an animation attribute here so we could say en is out or YZ in and out whenever I think of ease in and out I think of the word East as the word slow and the word in as the word beginning and out would be end so I always think of this as slow at the beginning faster at the end now this is not going to work because this browser requires you to have the WebKit prefix so again we have to use WebKit transition right and now you'll see the transition happening it's kind of a slower version of it we have to add the prefixes for all other browsers so remember to go to this website and remember you have to add WebKit Moss MS and O so we'll do that here that's how you do a center grid of images of a certain width with transitions and opacity settings on hover
