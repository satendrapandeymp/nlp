let's refer back to the markup that we created in the previous lesson wouldn't it be helpful if there was a way to be notified when we make errors when creating our markup for example let's say that we accidentally forgot to close off this div right here and maybe there's a paragraph that you accidentally deleted but didn't mean to let's come back and reload the page and it seems to look fine and this is important browsers especially newer browsers are smart enough to make up for your bad coding so even though you forgot a P tag the browser will assume okay well they Mintz who do it I will add that on for them and the same thing with the div now in this case likely leaving off a div would screw up your markup but because the div was close solo to the bottom it probably didn't have an effect but it will so what we really need is a way to quickly run it through a validator and it will make sure if we've done everything correctly well we can't do that if we browse to validator w3.org we can validate any webpage now before we continue it's important to understand that you must not always receive a 100% validation score validation is meant for you it's a tool to make sure you didn't make any mistakes however if you know what you're doing don't blindly follow it it's not a rule it's a tool next I'm going to click on more options and let's see if there's anything special in this case I'm going to specify we are working with an html5 page but now if we try to paste in our local URL this isn't going to work validation is meant for pages that are online and you can see right here cannot be checked so there are some plugins for browsers like Chrome and Firefox you can use however you can also do things like direct input and file upload so why don't we try file upload first we're going to browse the desktop learning I'm going to upload that right there and we will choose html5 and check now we can see that we made three errors and four warnings and let's see what they are first we'll see using experimental feature that's just letting you know next no character encoding found however if we come back and we check this we can see we do have character encoding so that's fine next we can see doctype override and effect and what we see here is we forgot the doctype on this specific page so we can go ahead and add that in even though to be honest it's not that important these days but we will go ahead and add it in like so now we have errors what we had up here were warnings now we're going to find the mistakes we've made and we see element head is missing a required instance of child element title and what this teaches us is that within the head every page must have a title element and we'll say my fragment so now you can see we can use this as a tool to check what mistakes we've made next we had end tag article seen but there was no open elements and that's on line 37 let's scroll down and say line 37 right here and what it's saying is it found a closing article tag but it could not find the opening so this shows we do have it here so sometimes it can get confused if you've made other errors so let's continue on and skip that one and now we have an unclosed div on line 13 for class of preview so we see right here there's no closing div so let's add that on and we'll do it right here in this case it thinks it's for the preview but it's actually missing a closing for the body element so now let's revalidate if it was on the web we could press revalidate but we have to re-up load our modified file in this particular case so now let's do it again and now we can see good job it's been checked as HTML 5 it's passed and there was only one warning and that warning is we're using experimental features of course we are so this is the way to validate your pages you don't need to do it all the time but it is a good habit to validate as you're working through a project maybe every few hours or so make sure that you haven't made any mistakes because if you're in a situation where it seems as if your CSS is not being applied correctly and you know you're doing everything right maybe you've created your markup poorly if you ever go on a forum and ask for advice about CSS not taking effect one of the first things people will recommend is that you validate your HTML now just as we can validate HTML we can so validate CSS if we scroll down you can see if you wish to validate specific content there are other validators and tools available so let's click on CSS and now this is just the same we can upload our stylesheet CSS style check and do note in a real world you would not upload your files there are built-in plug-ins for code editors and browser plug-ins that will do this for you and we can see there is one error and the error is unknown pseudo elements or pseudo class last child and that's because it's validating this as CSS too but last child is a css3 feature so we know we're good to go they're good this project is wrapped we're done with our small fragment great job in the next lesson I'm going to teach you about Zen coding now this is not a coding topic it's a way to code faster if you've ever noticed me over the course of these first few videos doing something like my class and then I hit tab you'll see that that will expand to a div and it's really really helpful especially when creating markup so I will show you how to use it in the next lesson
