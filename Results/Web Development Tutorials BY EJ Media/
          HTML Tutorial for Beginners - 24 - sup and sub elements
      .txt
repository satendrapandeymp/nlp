in this video we are going to talk about the soup and sub elements in HTML the soup element stands for superscript and the sub element stands for subscript the soup element allows you to display text above the main body of text and you can see an example how that works in normal typography these characters right here are above the main body of text now subscript is the exact opposite we place the text below the main text okay so let's go ahead and use these two elements in our HTML page so what we want to do first is raise the Ardi here for August 23rd we want to put this Rd above the 23 and that's something you'll see in normal typography so first let's go ahead and put in the opening tag of the soup element so we'll just put su P here and then we'll go ahead and close it out and let's go ahead and save this will refresh our page and there you can see the Rd now is above the main body of text which is what we want it now let's take a look at this second paragraph now usually in terms of chemical notation for h2o the two is usually below the h and the up so what we want to do is actually put this below the H and we do that of course with the sub element so let's go ahead and put that in here and we'll go ahead and close it out now let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see this looks more accurate on our HTML page now looks like an actual chemical notation so these aren't widely used elements but they're good to know it it can add a little bit more professionalism and pizzazz to your web page okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
