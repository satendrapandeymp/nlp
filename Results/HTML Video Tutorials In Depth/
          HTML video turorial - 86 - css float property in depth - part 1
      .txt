hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss CSS float property in the previous video tutorial will be understood that CSS float property can be used to float an image either to the left or to the right of a content are we can wrap a content around an image CSS float property not only used to float images it is used to create flexible layouts in this tutorial I am going to discuss about CSS float property let us discuss about it step-by-step I go to start say notepad click on notepad then I type here opening his table tag closing his table tag opening head closing head opening body tag and closing body tag in the head section I write opening title tag there I say CSS float demo closing title tag file save as I save the file with the name float demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotation and save the file a desktop I click on Save button I minimize it you can see that float demo dot HTML page were created I right click on it open with the Firefox you can see here float demo dot HTML page open and title is set to CSS float demo now we understand step by step in the body tag I create a div element opening day and closing div in between I write the content div 1 file save good browser and refresh here you can see the 1 content got displayed we know that div is a block level element we know that block level elements are going to start always on a new fresh line they put the content on new fresh line and they take entire available width to prove that I am going to use style tag and then I say here type text or CSS then I say closing style tag here I write some styles for div element we are telling to the browser locate every div in this current page and apply the border of 1 pixel solid black if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh you can see it is displaying the border browser displaying a border around the div 1 element you can cd1 has occupied the entire available world if I create one more div element opening day of tag and here I say div two and closing day of death I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that div - God created our new fresh line and it has took the entire available width similarly I am going to create one more do opening deep closing tip in between I write dev 3 file save good browser and refresh you can see deep 3 God created on new fresh line and it has took the entire available width hope you guys are understanding how the block level tags work so div is a block level tag now I want to set few more properties I say here width of every day should be 100 pixels semicolon file save good browser and refresh you can see that width is set to 100 pixel for every do this time do one is taking only this much amount of space on the browser window and also you can see div 2 has not moved beside do 1 becomes as divs are a block level tag they always put their content on new fresh line d3 has been not moved beside div 2 has not been placed beside you - even though space is available free because divs are block level tags they always put their content on new fresh line similarly I write height should be 100 pixel semicolon file save every day is going to have the height now 100 pixel then I said font - size of 24 point semicolon everyday font should be set to 24 point can see the content got displayed I want to apply some background color also so I say here background - color ye ll o W semicolon if I say like that every dip is going to have the background color yellow set file save go to browser and refresh you can see our lives are having the background color yellow but I do not want that hence I am going to remove this I want to uniquely identify each of the deal and apply different background color on them to do that I am going to use ID attribute and I give name for this div 1 and then I say here locate a div element which has the ID day 1 and apply background color of Sian save now what happens every div is going to have these properties and do one is going to have a background color cyan div two and div three are going to have a background-color:transparent by default divs are going to have transparent background file save go to browser and refresh you can see that div 1 has a background color sign set div 2 and D 3 are transparent they are showing white background color because the body color is hide color similarly I am going to say div ID equal to give two again here I say located you which has the ID div 2 and apply background - color of magenta semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the background color has been set to div 2 magenta similarly I identify this as a div 3 double quotation and I say here Dave hash dip three in double quotation I put B AC K G ro even the background - color - ye ll o double yellow semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see deep three now set to background color yellow now we understand how float works I go to do one and say here float le ft left float property takes three different values left right and none so here I am giving float left we are telling to the browser that do one should be floated to left file save now what happens I explain you should imagine every container in this way you should imagine that there will be container in which you put different elements so at present we have in our body container D 1 D 2 and D 3 and also you should imagine like in front of the containers there will be a float layer you should imagine as always every container has one extra layer on top of it and with the name float layer now when you set float left to any element what happens is that element is going to be taken out of the normal flow or taken out of the container layer and it is moved to the float layer hope you guys are understanding when it is moved to the float layer if it is a block level element it is going to be turned into inline level element and as we know that there is nothing in this place as we have moved that from the body layer to the float layer this div two and dip three are going to be shifted top like this one of the important thing you need to know is as a div two is moved behind a new one are you understanding you have to understand this guys if I draw like this div two is exactly behind D 1 so div two content cannot be displayed or can't be visible to the user hence what browser will do means it will put the content down itself at the d3 place and only the styles of div 2 are going to be moved behind the one so div to content and div three content are going to get overlap let's see that if I say here refresh you can see that div one is floated to the left and div 2 style has been moved behind the div 1 and if you observe carefully div 2 and div three contents are getting overlap here you have div 2 and F 3 div 2 place is occupied by the div 3 element hope you guys are understanding how floating works quite simple similarly this time what I do I say div 2 FL o eighty float L EFT left semicolon so we are setting float on div 2 also now as I told what happens we have to understand this clearly when I said div do also float it is going to be taken out of the normal flow from the container and placed beside the div 1 element as I told when you apply float property on a div element or a block level element it is going to be turned to inline level element so we know that inline level element allows other element to sit beside of it so it is quite simple to understand and now D 1 is on the float layer and we can display the content div 2 here so here displays Dib - and this is actually div three right this is game 3 and you can see here div 1 div 2 as we don't have nothing in the container layer so div 3 is going to be moved up and you should see carefully that div 3 is behind the one dip 3 is behind do one as div 3 is going to be behind the one dip 3 content will not get displayed hence browser puts its content below only only the styles are going to be moved behind a div 1 you can observe that if I say here refresh you can see that div 1 and div 2 are one beside another they turned into inline you can see and div 3 style has been moved behind u 1 and D 3 content is below the div 1 only browser understands content is one of the most important thing not the styles hence Styles our mood behind u 1 and T 3 content is still here only so what we can do is we can set the float on it also float le ft left semicolon file save good browser and refresh you can see that div 3 also floated to the left so here D 1 D 2 D 3 are now on float layer 1 beside another that is what the float does guys Dave 3 and there is nothing in the container layer I hope it's clear to you like how floating works and what exactly happens with respect to the floor property when you apply the float on different elements what is happening there as we know that every div div 1 div 2 dip three these are all divs only we can remove these float attributes we can remove these float properties we can simply say in David's elf every do should be floated to left semicolon now we know that what happens is every dave is going to have a float property except two left so if i go back and refresh you can see that they are floating left D 1 D 2 and D 3 R 1 beside another if I remove this and save file save go to browser and refresh they will be in a normal flow one below another in the body container lair so if we set float:left every div is going to be moved out of the normal flow they are going to be taken out of the container layer and they placed on the float layer one beside another d1 d2 d3 quite simple next thing we are going to understand is how do we stop applying float or how do we clear the float effect for example we go again and I say for div one float L aft left semicolon if we say like that we know that Dave one is going to be taken out of the normal flow taken out of the body container layer and it is placed on the floor layer and we know that once the do one is moved to the float layer there will be nothing behind the div one in the body layer so div two style is going to be moved behind the one and div three is going to be placed at Dave - Dave - and div 3 contents are going to get overlap if i refresh you can see whatever we are thinking it is correct only if you want that div two styles should not get affected by float that we have applied on a div one what you can do is you can simply say here clear left floating so div two is getting affected because of the ones float left if you do not want that to happen you just need to say clear left if you say clear left what happens is you can observe that div two styles are going to be placed back and div three is going to be moved down if i refresh you can see that Dave do is in the same place with its styles and div three is also in its same place with its styles that is how the clearing works hope you guys are understanding if I said here also float le FP left float L EFT left semicolon file save good browser and refresh we know that div 1 is going to be on a float layer dev 2 is going to be on floor layer beside day one and div 3 styles are going to be moved behind the one and div 3 content will be placed active - if i refresh you can see that the and if you are one beside another and if three content is below the div one and its tiles are behind day one so what we can do is we can use CLE AR clear left if you same file save what happens is of course deep three is not going to be affected by the float:left that we have applied to div tomb and its styles are going to be given back to the three if i refresh you can see that deep three is below the d1 with its styles it is not getting affected by any float property that we have set to previous elements quite simple similarly if I say to this also flat-4 left file save go to browser and refresh it is also going to be floated to the float layer so quite simple I hope you guys are understanding that is how the float:left works and how do you clear floats you can use the float properties to create flexible web page layouts file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks now you can see that for this tutorial this much is enough friends watch this video again and again and understand how float works for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much
