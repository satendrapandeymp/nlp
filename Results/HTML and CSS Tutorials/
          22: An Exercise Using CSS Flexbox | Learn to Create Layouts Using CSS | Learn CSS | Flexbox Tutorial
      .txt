how's it going everyone in this episode we're gonna learn how to create a gallery using flexbox now I just want to mention before we get started that this is a flexbox exercise it's not a gallery exercise so the way we create a gallery in this episode is probably not the way that you want to create it in a real real world website okay so in a later episode I will teach you guys how to create a real gallery where you can actually click on the images and then they pop up into a big format but that's not gonna be the focus of this lesson here now if you can tell from our voice I'm kind of sick right now so I hope my voice won't go into puberty mode too many times throughout this video so I'm gonna try and do my best to do not screw up my my talking okay so what I have here is this is actually the website that we created some episodes ago where we created a front page that was mobile responsive and we created a what you call a cases page we're gonna open up a case page now I just took that website we created and again you can download from the description from my what do you call my patreon page if you want to or you can just go and watch those previous episodes if you absolutely want to follow that website specifically now if you don't want to follow that specific website we created a few episodes ago then it's perfectly fine just to set up a MC HTML document and then just you know create whatever we're trying to create inside the main text here without all this other stuff to have inside the footer and the head and all that so it's perfectly fine you don't have to follow this website specifically okay I'm again this is just a flexbox exercise so just focus on the flexbox part okay now what I have in here is I went ahead and just copy-paste it my cases page from inside the previous website and I can actually show you guys how it looks like because if you go inside our this is the website we built started creating some episodes ago if I go to cases you can see we have let me actually click it there we have these boxes in here that are not responsive because we didn't do that in the previous exercise um but this is basically what the gallery is going to look like now there's going to be some differences because I do want the gallery images to go all the way to the width of the browser so once we rescale the website using flexbox it's going to start shifting around the content and move the images down to the next line if there's no more space on it okay so I'm just gonna go back to the gallery peeps I created again I just copy-paste the cases file and the only thing I changed was inside the main text we have I removed the section tag and instead I just created a wrapper which is a div that has the h2 tag you know the name of the actual page inside of it now I did also give my h2 tag a class so we can actually style it separately and I went ahead and gave that class I'm styling inside the CSS file over here now one thing you guys may notice is that do actually help my HTML file on the left side and the CSS file on the right side and this is something you guys can do if you have your files together this is how we usually need to do it I have my HTML file here my CSS file up here you can just drag and drop on the right side inside this text editor if you want to and then you get this layout here which is kind of nice I think so let me actually go down to what we have the gallery again there we go and let's actually go and scroll down to the main text here now the first thing I want to do is I would like to set up this section that we are going to actually use know to create these images that we want to see inside the web site so I'm going to create a section tag and inside this section tag I'm going to add a class I'm going to call this one gallery links I'm just going to copy it from the h2 tag up here and inside the section tags I'm going to create an anchor tag which is a link the anchor tag is mainly used if you want to open up the images inside the browser in a bigger format but like I said we're not gonna focus in that in this episode but we still need to have the anchor tag okay inside the anchor tag I'm going to create an image now we could do this in a bunch of ways such as creating a tip box that has that has an image as a background but we're just gonna focus on a completely regular image in this episode okay now inside the source tag I'm going to link to an image that I do have inside my root folder so this is the cases folder that we have I can actually size this up a bit so you can actually see there we go have my images folder I do have an image of a mountain that is called gallery image the day peg I'm just gonna copy the name and already tell them starting to sound really sick I'm just gonna paste it inside the source and make sure that I go inside my image folder and then the link today much okay inside the alt tag we can say we have a gallery image or we could say an image of a mountain or something and in this episode I'm just sort of going to copy paste what we have here a bunch of times underneath each other but in a real example where you create a real gallery you might want to change the alt tag description to match the image to be actually linking to I'm just gonna copy paste the same image in this episode so you can go and switch them out if you want to now I'm also going to go ahead and go inside my anchor tag here and give it a class I'm gonna set it to gallery - IMG which stands for image and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and just copy paste the anchor tag so we have about 8 of them I think because that would be a good amount to actually showcase inside the website there we go so not only have 8 of these who basically did everything you need to do inside our HTML page now do you remember when it comes to flexbox I'm going to apply it to the section tag here meaning that this is going to be the actual flexbox and then all the items inside the Flex box are going to be the items inside the Flex box now do bear in mind that whatever styling we add to the item inside the Flex box only affects the direct child of the flex box mean that we don't style the image using flexbox we style the anchor tag using flexbox okay if that makes sense and the same thing goes for all the other anchor text it's on the first child of the section so the image tag here would actually be the second child of the Flex box okay so inside my gallery you'll notice that we have our link to the h2 tag I also created a body called a responsive media query in order to change the format when we scale down to a mobile format so I'm just gonna go inside must say we have a class gallery links and the first thing we need to do is declare this as a flexbox so we're gonna say display flex then underneath a I'm gonna say flex - flow and then we can set this one to two different parameters we're going to set it as a regular row and we're also gonna set this one to rap let's actually spell that correctly there we go which means that it's gonna go ahead and take all the items and display them from left to right and if there's no more room in one line it's gonna shove it down to next line okay so we get multiple lines inside our website so now that we have this we can actually go ahead and go down and create a new styling so I can actually copy paste this like so I'm gonna change the link to gallery - image IMG and in here we're gonna go and change a couple of things first of all I'm gonna set a Flex basis which in this case I think is the only thing we need to actually do to this specific gallery and I'm gonna set this one to something like let's say 23% now the next thing I'm gonna add is going to be a margin because I do want to have some spacing in between the images so I'm gonna say margin and I'm gonna set this one to something like 20 pixels let's actually go and see how it looks like inside the browser so if i refresh you can see that we do have some spacing now I do think there's too much spacing in between the images so we might actually change that back down to maybe 10 pixels instead I'm gonna go in here refresh and it looks a lot better so what we need to do now is we need to actually tell the images how big this should actually be because we do have some images inside the you know the links that we have here so I'm going to copy-paste the gallery image styling and say we have an image inside of it and then I'm gonna set the width to 100% so it's 100% width of the anchor tag okay so rescales together with the Flex box I'm gonna refresh and there we have it now there's another thing you guys will notice because we do have more spacing on the right side on the left side over here so not to fix that we need to change the we call it the precision of all the different elements when it comes to the horizontal axis so if we were to go back up to our container here I'm gonna say justify content and then we're going to set it to Center save it go back inside the website refresh and now I got some notice that we do actually have content going buddy called in the center of the website so were to rescale it you can actually see that it actually scales with the website and if I keep scaling down it does axis shift when I do scale it now we do have one issue here though because you may notice that the image is also scale with the actual website and that's because right now we did actually set the gallery - image to a percentage and in some cases this might be the effect that you want to have inside a gallery because it sort of scales with the abuse so you don't have to big images inside the website but let's actually go and change this front percentage to something like pixels so I'm gonna go ahead and say we have 300 pixels and with now do bear in mind that the image down here will scale the height according to the width so we don't need to do anything about that so if we were to go ahead and save it go back inside the browser refresh you get this a different effect which i think is a lot better when it comes to a gallery and the cool thing about this is that it does actually change if you were to even go down on the cell phone now if this is what you want to see where the image is this size for example on a mobile phone then you're practically done but let's actually go ahead and change this out inside the mobile format so we do actually have a full width image once we do actually go down to the mobile so what we could do is simply copy the gallery image here paste it inside the media query and then say we want to change it back to a percentage inside the Flex basis so I'm gonna go and say we want to have something like 90 percent we don't need to do anything about the margin I do believe so I'm just gonna remove that I'm gonna go back inside the browser refresh and once the do actually get down to mobile Matt you will notice that it doesn't change it and that is because we did actually change at the wrong place you do actually to have this tiling up here because this is the mobile format so I'm just gonna go ahead and paste it now we do actually need to have the margin that was probably a way quicker way to do this so I'm just gonna shift these around I'm gonna place down here there we go so now let's actually go ahead and refresh and I guess we'll see that we have a different size that us actually fit with the browser once we're inside mobile format so if you have different mobile screens with different sizes then we'll always be a ninety percent of the width once I do go up to a desktop format or template format it's going to change into this regular view again which is really nice so this is how we can use flexbox inside something like a gallery and in a future episode we will actually learn how to create a real gallery because if it works you just click an image you can see nothing happens because I do actually have be called hashtag on all the links here we could I do believe just link to the image like so refresh the browser and then we'll actually open up the image inside a different page now this is not something that opens on the same page so we can actually exit the image so anything we do actually need to click back in order to do that so I hope you guys sort of figured out how to do this based on this tutorial so I hope you guys enjoy I'll see you guys next time I'd like to say thank you to all the people supporting me on patreon advance to the next with benefits such as lesson materials then go ahead and visit the link to do see on screen here and I'll see you guys next time [Music]
