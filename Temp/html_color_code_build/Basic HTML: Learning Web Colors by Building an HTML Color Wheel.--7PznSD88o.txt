in this episode we'll study web colors by making our very own color wheel [Music] [Music] hi I am sam garper welcome back to my channel I am so stoked I'm so very happy to be here I'm so happy to see each and every one of you for this lesson we will use everything we've learned from lesson 1 to 4 we will learn about web colors how to use them on our websites and we will build our very own HTML CSS color wheel if you are new to this channel in a beginner please start with lesson 1 you need the proper tools to understand this lesson before we begin let's greet Bilal meraz from India it is birthday today happy birthday below keep learning keep pushing keep coding now let's give credit where it is due for the registration form congratulations candy confidence Yvette Peters maja Joe Ranjan on layaway Nika and I b.o.b for chess board challenge congratulations Jacobo Abdul Malik and Bashir Sally sue for HTML tags basics our lesson - congratulations Ferdinand dela Cruz you're the holding Filipino in this group now for the lessons [Music] what is color how do we see color how do we use colors for beginners and non beginners alike this is a question there is a philosophical way to answer this and there is a practical way and because this is a tutorials Channel let's go practical color is how we perceive light the human eye can see seven million colors and it does this by sensing colors so how the human sense colors simple the human eye absorbs colors bouncing of different objects for example if we look at an apple we see red right but what's really happening is that we see red because that color is not absorbed by the Apple it means that the Apple absorb blue and green and reflects red thus we see red the same thing goes with any other color if you see a blue car it means that the colors red and green were absorbed by the car and blue is reflected speaking of red green and blue red green and blue or RGB are primary colors it means that all seven million colors we see is a combination of red green and blue in 1801 Thomas Jung proposed this theory the trichromatic color theory simply put everything is composed of RGB RGB is a primary color palette if you mix red and green you get yellow if you mix green and blue you get cyan if you mix blue and red you get magenta if you mix all colors you get black this is called the secondary color palette or CMYK colors in computer code colors in HTML and CSS can be expressed in four ways but we will only focus on the most important ways by name RGB and hexadecimal colors by name if you want to use colors by name you have about 140 standard color names at your disposal go to this link if you want to try them all in basic use they can be applied as such if you want to change the color of a text you do this in CSS caller : for a polar read text again caller : Green for a green text color blue for a blue text on the other hand if you use the RGB method or hex method it is done in this manner color : RGB open and close parentheses zero comma zero comma zero for black because zero means no light so it's black on the other hand if you want to show white color RGB 255 comma 255 comma 255 for white because 255 means 100% brightness for the color red you do RGB 255 which is red zero for green zero for blue so you get 100% red for green you do color RGB 0 comma 2 5 5 comma 0 the middle part is green so that's green 100% green and lastly for blue you type color RGB 0 comma 0 to 5 5 for blue because the last digit is 100% blue all values can go from 0 to 255 no more there's no - 5 6 there's 2 - 5 7 is just 0 to 255 on the other hand for the hex method it is done in this manner color pound sign or sharp sign zero zero zero zero means no light for white this is how you do with color pound or sharp F F F F means 100% brightness if you convert to five five decimal to hexadecimal that will result to F F okay okay let's go for red you do color sharp sign F 0 0 it is almost the same as our G be the first letter or digit is read second green color sharp sign 0 F 0 because the middle digit is green now for blue color sharp sign 0 0 F the last digit is blue do note that 0 0 0 or hash 0 0 0 is a shorthand for hashed sign 0 0 0 0 0 0 values can go from 0 to 9 then a to F this is the hexadecimal number system so that's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ABCDE F or a to 10 then F is 15 you can try to mix and match any of these values to get different kinds of colors try it most web developers prefer the hexadecimal method because it is easier to type [Music] [Applause] in this exercise we'll build our very own interactive color wheel in the previous section of previous parts of this video I've mentioned that all colors are composed of red green and blue or RGB they're what we call the primary colors and if we mix them together especially alongside one another we get the c-myc a scale or the cyan magenta yellow and black scale to build this exercise we will use a lot of div tags as well as an extensive use of the possession as well as such as form CSS declarations if you are new to this channel and want a basic understanding of CSS please stop this video now and go to lessons 3 & 4 you must have the right tools before you can do the exercises here position:absolute there is a little explanation of what they are the position CSS declaration tells the browser how to position HTML tags in the browser for example if you put in your CSS position:absolute which we'll use for this lesson you are telling the browser to act like a grid so if you have an element say a div tag and say that it has a position:absolute the browser will wait for two more declarations it will wait for the left and pop CSS declarations as you may have guessed the left declaration tells the browser how far from the left an element should be placed in the same manner the top CSS declaration tells the browser how far from the top of the browser the element should be placed if you find this hard to understand in blue in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox web developer tools you can use the ruler tool to help you get the top and left values lastly top and left values can be expressed in pixels or percentages transform rotate to cap things off let's talk about the transform declaration for this lesson we'll only focus on their rotate attribute the rotate' attribute there's a browser if you well yes to date the element the rotate' attribute uses the values and degrees if you are not familiar with degrees here's a compass so that you have an idea okay let's code but before we proceed with the demo let me just assure everyone that I will be using huge texts in my text editor for this demo because I noticed that a lot of you had a hard time reading my code and I'm sorry for that anyway for this lesson also I will separate and post the color codes on the right side of the screen so that you can follow along or you don't have to figure them out the color codes you know and so that it would be much much much much much more easier for you to follow along this coding session I will superimpose the full color code chart in this video so that it would be a lot easier for you to figure out how to do the actual color wheel so let's go okay so as usual we begin with a reference image something that we can copy so this is the color wheel to the top is the red on the lower left side is a green and the blue red green blue that is RGB the primary color and yellow magenta and cyan is the secondary color so this is what we will build using HTML but with a twist because we have to put the gradations or the intensity of redness or darkness of each color so as I have discussed earlier we will be using hexadecimal values because that's what I prefer personally and actually most web developers do prefer so let's begin as usual we will go with our HTML star skeleton lock type HTML close it HTML then you type and remember the HTML skeleton okay then say body and body okay so save it as let's save it a scholar wheel dot HTML there you go so now we have the HTML skeleton and let's put a title here let's put a title as mm let's see let's put a title as color wheel okay now we will go back to our reference material okay so this one so red and 16 values so as I've mentioned earlier I will be putting some of the the color codes here to the left side of the text editor so that we will have a reference so let's start first with the original structure or the structure of the images so this one will start with a red okay so we start with a div class this is the original container this will be the container for the this one the container for the red so let's start so as I've mentioned earlier we have 16 values for red so they will be all be here so let's start div class then let's say div close it and then let's do an inline styling for this so div style background color oops background color and then it start with a the lightest value because our direction is lightest to darkest light that's the darkest let's start with the value of yeah the brightest so that is f 0 0 ok and then we say we copy this FF 0 0 so that we have a reference and then copy/paste everything 1 so this is the smart way to code guys I taught you this in lesson 3 2 3 & 4 ok 1 2 3 4 5 6 so I need 16 so this will make it 12 12 and I need two more so here's two ok so this is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen books one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen two more fifteen sixteen okay let's begin so this one is the brightest FF 0 0 which is bright red and this one should be black so 0 0 and then this is the trick guys I mentioned before the texted decimal is arranged like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then 9 and then a b c d e f ok so this is 10 11 12 13 14 15 we will follow this pattern here so f e d see be a nine eight seven six five four three two one zero okay if we check this in our browser it's all red you know why it's all red because we did not change the actual background color we just put here the appropriate label so we will copy this okay so to make it more easier zero one two three four five six seven eight nine a b c c d e and now let's check our browser see the nernst our gradient okay so for now we will focus on building the RGB scale so now let's identify this as the red scale okay so that we will not get confused later and then because we are smart developers we will copy/paste this okay and then rename this as the green scale okay this one green scale and the green scale is the black goes in the middle at the center so this is the lightest so we will start with the black and go down to the brightest okay so that's the reverse of that one so this one is called the green scale so as i've mentioned earlier hexadecimal values this one is red this one is green this one is blue so in order for us to make this green we should replace the middle F the middle zero with an F and then turn off the red turn off the red turn off the blue turn on the green okay so that is our partner to make it easy for everyone zero zero zero f zero yeah because we are starting with the Oh No starting with the darkest so this is zero one two let's convert this to all to zero to make it easier for us because we are smart developers right so let's be smart about this okay let's convert everything to zero first so that we don't get confused okay okay so the darkest goes to the top and then the lightest goes to the bottom so one two three follow this follow this four five six seven eight nine okay ten is a b c d e f okay so we are done with the colors but we are not done yet with a label so we will follow it again okay it's zero zero zero one zero zero two zero zero three zero little four zero zero five zero zero six zero zero seven zero zero eight zero zero nine zero zero A zero 0 B 0 0 C 0 0 D 0 0 e zero okay and then lastly 0 f 0 okay so we've followed this one okay 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 times and I made a mistake here let's do it okay now we test it again I'll tab so this should be green okay there you go see green and then we do the blue part this one blue so the blue part is slight degree in the darkest is here and then the lightest is here the bottom part so we will essentially copy-paste this entire thing again because we are smart developers and rename this as blue scale okay so we will follow this pattern but the final the last digit should be the one moving okay so again let's convert everything to zero to make it easier or yeah make it easier okay zero zero zero zero zero zero zero okay sorry zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero same with this one okay very good it's faster now you're getting faster that's the point of this exercise is to make us code faster okay so this is red this is green and this is blue so this one should be zero zero black one two three four five six day see the pattern now seven eight nine a b c d e f okay so this is the bluest bluest blue okay let's follow it here one two three four five six seven eight nine a b c d e f okay now let's test it in the browser oops so this should happen blue there you go very good okay so because we want to do the color wheel in such a matter this is 90 degrees this is naked this is 45 degrees in this is negative 45 degrees or 27 degrees so we have to be you have to we have to move it in such a way so that this will appear okay so let's test it now let's do some CSS so let's start with the red scale Oh mind you I've already done this earlier so I kinda know where to position it but if you really want to position it or wanna troubleshoot where to put the exact of boxes or or the exact color scales are this is what you do you click gear icon we have to install first web developer tools click this and then click ruler and then you will have this red box and this if you know this this box you can actually resize if you want to put it here and then you just have to copy this one the width and the height so this is the width and this is the height and the position X that means left x and y 204 or or the exact color scales are this is what you do you click gear icon we have to install first web developer tools click this and then click ruler and then you will have this red box and this if you know this this box you can actually resize if you want to put it here and then you just have to copy this one the width and the height so this is the width and this is the height and the position X that means left x and y 204 so Y this is y okay go six so Y this is y okay 206 so I've already done this earlier so let's do this right now let's do the styling the CSS so let's start with the style okay style very good now remember we have to control the div class div class color so div color okay and then we will restrict the width to 60 pixels okay with this equals to 60 pixels just for out of habit I'm gonna do this display:block although dips are automatically display block but I'm just so used to it so let's do it like that and then let's say float:left guys you have to research on this what happens if you float left and text-align I wanna text-align:center because I want this value this label to be in the middle stock middle of the div so let's test the color boom see now it is all aligned like such now we have to move it in this manner red green and blue so this is totally vertical so we don't have to change absolutely anything here this is slanted or rotated by 45 degrees and this is 270 degrees so this is how we will do this remember earlier I told you that we will be using a lot of dips so here are a lot of dips and primarily we will use the position absolute and transform rotate CSS declaration so div let's start with red scale first okay red scale and then we will start with saying that red scale is position for CSUN absolute absolute this means that this one the red the div or the color the div red scale ID rep skin will no longer follow the carriage returns so when we do refresh it will automatically rise on top of everything else so an example of this if I say for example top and then left let's just say this is an experiment I say 200 or 20 pixels from the top and 200 from the left this is what's gonna happen 20 pixels this going down and then 200 going right so there you go okay it's now a grid we can move it anywhere we like so as I've mentioned earlier I've provided the coordinates the top-left annotation here so let's just follow it for now and leave you to experiment with this because obviously we have different kinds of screen so this would somehow differ differ from one screen to another okay let's do the pop us because I've done this earlier 84 and tested this out seven three eight okay let's test it boom there we go and you have to remove this garbage okay there you go next we will do the green tab so the green green scale you have to control it as well you have to copy paste this and just just rename bit because we are working smart position:absolute is the same and then we will follow the top as 284 to 84 pixels 478 pixels from the left so if we refresh this oops there you go okay very good okay and we remove the garbage because this is garbage okay very good let's blue so we will remove the garbage here there you go now we will repeat this okay so this is how you rotate transform then rotate and then open close parenthesis and then say because we are dealing with an 45 degree angle here follow the compass guys we will do this transform 45 degree or degrees then if you refresh this there you go see how easy that is nice okay next we will do our next the blue scale so again copy paste copy and paste it and then let's just say blue scale same position absolute and then we will do 284 because it's the same because they are essentially the same level should be up here so position absolute and then left should be higher 738 pixels and then we say negative 45 degrees okay so when we refresh it boom there you go so now we are almost done but there's a mistake here so this should be a little this should be on top somehow so let's try let's try to make it like yeah 30 and 608 pixels okay the red scale refresh there you go okay next what's next what do we do next now there's still something wrong with this though okay okay so now we're done with the RGB scale so I just I added four twelve so that this would compress a little and then what we will do is define a styling for the body so let's just say font-family:arial and then I want to color it white or F F F see how useful that is so there you go so we're done with we're done with the red the green and the blue now let's do yellow first yellow so now let's do yellow scale so copy just like before paste it and then rename the ID as yellow scale okay so yellow it's a combination of red and green so this is the first digit and the second digit so let's follow this and then the black is this here so 0 0 here that's correct so this is 0 this is this should be 1 1 2 2 0 okay 3 3 0 0 because this is red and this is green and then we should say 4 4 0 okay and then 5 5 0 and then 6 6 0 and then 7 7 0 and then 8 8 0 9 9 0 a a 0 b b 0 0 c 0 BD 0 ee 0 and then FF 0 now we should test it first so that we are sure that it's we've done the yellow tag yellow so there you go ok but we made a mistake because the yellow tag should be in Reverse the darkest should be at the bottom so we have to redo it ok so in order for us to redo this is there's no other way but to retype it okay so this is FF 0 p 0 DD 0 CC zero vb zero k 0 9 9 0 8 8 0 7 7 0 6 6 0 5 5 0 4 4 0 3 3 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 so let's test it so now that's correct now we will do the scien scale so that's a combination of green and blue so now let's do that so science kale copy go down paste and then let's type cyan scales that's high an okay so it is green and blue so this is red green and blue so this should be all 0 okay and before before you get black is should be on top black should be here so we should start with zero zero okay zero zero okay zero one one because it's green okay that's zero two two zero three three zero four four zero five five zero six six zero seven seven zero eight eight zero nine nine zero a a zero vb zero six six oops b b0 c c0 d d0 e e0 f f now if we check this this should be a science scale at the side of the yellow scale so there you go very good now we'll do the last one which is the magenta scale which is a combination of red and blue to the science scale so again we will copy paste this okay copy and then we will say magenta scale and then it's the exact reverse again oh this we will start with a light test here because our scale is going black so it should be bright magenta dark dark dark dark dark darkest magenta so hey it's magenta so let's do that so it should start with the lightest so this is a combination of red and blue so start with the lightest F F okay are you getting the drift of this e 0 e okay d 0 d c 0 c b 0 b a zero a okay now nine zero nine eight zero eight seven zero zero seven zero seven six zero six five zero five four zero four three zero three two zero two one zero one and of course zero zero zero so now let's look at the magenta scale so this should appear boom so now we are ready to place them along side the other scales okay so let's start with the yellow let's go to the CSS part okay yellow scale copy paste yellow scale okay position:absolute and we'll follow that the top should be 84 pixels the left should be 478 pixels and then up sorry and then the rotation is negative 45 degrees so now let's test it boom so that's the yellow scale so that's the yellow scale okay now we start next with the cyan scale so again because we are smart web developers we don't be type everything copy okay paste and then we say science scale and then what we'll do is plug in three three three eight okay and then left six oh eight and then rotate zero because there's no rotation here zero degrees okay you can do that or we can remove this altogether it's the same thing so now we refresh it there you go and now we'll lastly for the magenta scale we just copy/paste this okay very good and then paste and then should we say magenta scale and then for magenta scale we have top 84 pixels left which is seven three eight pixels and we have a rotation here so let's type transform click all in rotate and then open close parenthesis and then 45 degrees now if we check this if we refresh this it's it's not tough sorry then crease we forgot a deck okay there you go so now we're done with the color scale now for the little tricks okay so actually we are already done with the exercise so let's now do some tweaking so that this would look awesome okay so I will now teach you how to use the hover element or hover attribute property of CSS so now we will control all the dips all the dips inside the collar tag so color and all there's regardless of the name anything that's deep inside the color we will style so let's say copy/paste this copy div color and then all dibs okay all dibs this means inside the color there are dibs outside shell inside shell this can go on and on and on okay if you really want to target a specific element okay now we will do a little trick let's say that the div with is inherited in hell it means that whatever the width here of the mother is also the width of the child next let's say that I want to put a border oops inherit and then let's say I want to put a border for the dip so did that inherit that dip so they've won pick solid and let's just say three three three that's kind of great okay so if we look at it now okay there you go there is a div and there is a order okay okay that looks bad so that you move this right okay and then let's just say that I want my cursor to be a pointer or finger if it's on top of the div so let's just say cursor okay and then I say pointer and then go back to the browser refresh so now it's like that so here's the check you can actually check the hover hover um let's just say behavior of the browser we can do this div however so this means in English or go to the div collar okay div class color inside the div class color there are divs so this one and when you hover over it do this okay so let's just test it for a while I want to say that when I hover I want the width to be 100 pixels let's see what happens okay refresh look at this that's 100 pixels because it's hovering and then the finger see now it's a little cooler now I want to put it in the center so let's just say that margin margin zero the top zero ought to write zero at the left and bottom and the negative 20 pixels at the left most part of the div okay so when you refresh this it's now centered all right okay now we will also put here's the little trick that I want to show you guys you can actually do a little animation or some sort of from smoother animation when you do this because if you know this it's kind of choppy pixely effect okay so if we do this actually guys take note of this transition a transition then say with okay so I want that change the width change to be detected as a transition and I want the transition for 0.4 seconds or half a second and then I will say is look at the effect remember this one huh this one is kind of choppy look at it but when you apply the transition oh cool right but there's something wrong because now that the center is quite wrong okay so now we will also also control the margin effect so the same time we just step margin 0.4 seconds and ease and then when you refresh it there you go guys that's so neat looking look at this okay okay and now for the challenge of the week I know that every one of you is waiting for the challenge of the week but please bear with me because if you are having a hard time figuring out the challenges of the week it takes me like five times as long to figure out what to give or what kind of creative stuff I can do with HTML and CSS to make you feel excited to code so for this week's challenge we will use everything we've learned in Lesson one two three and four and as well as five we will use everything we've learned in this tutorials channel this is going to be really fun for hardcore web developers will have 100% of their attention and intention to be a web developer but extremely frustrating for those who are like a 50% not so much sure if they want to be a web developer the objective is to build a website with twelve pages which shows each primary and secondary color scale in a radial gradient a radial gradient is your color scales presented in a circular manner a normal scale the pattern stork is at the outer ring and light tests in the center ring in the reverse scale lightest values are the outer ring and darkest in the center so if you click red button it will take you to read that HTML and show you the red color scale darkest to lightest pattern if you click the red reverse button it will take you to the Red River stat each 2ml which shows the red color scale in life is the darkest pattern and so on the reason behind this challenge is to burn the color values into your memory lesson five repetition is key to mastering get yourself comfortable with a position CSS selector and declaration lessons four and five and master HTML tags especially the links lessons one and two once you are done please zip or are the file and send two tutorials at some galloper com before I go let me just say this if you want to be a coder you have the code if you want to be something great you have to do something great if you want to have something that you have never had before you need to do something you have never ever done before and that ends the tutorial the video the last video for the year so happy new year everyone and see you next year [Music]
