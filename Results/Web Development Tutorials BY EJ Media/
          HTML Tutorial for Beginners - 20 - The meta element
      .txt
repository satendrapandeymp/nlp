in this video we're going to go over the meta element now the meta elements are always put inside the head element so they will always go inside the head element and the reason is because meta elements are not visible to your web user and as you can see over here on the webpage none of the meta elements appear they will not appear on your web page and so the user will not see them they are merely to tell search engines about your web page and so you can provide all this information to the search engines using meta elements now we create a meta element using the meta tag you can see that right here and you'll notice we don't have a closing meta tag you only have an opening meta tag and then you just have to close it with a typical angle bracket so again it does not have a closing tag now meta tags use attributes to provide information to the search engine and there are different types of values for the name attribute and it is the type of value that gives each meta element its identity and so again the meta elements are differentiated by what value you set the name attribute to first one we're going to look at is description and that's probably the most important one and the two attributes that you use are the name attribute and the content attribute and in this one we're going to use the description value to provide a description to a search engine about our webpage so this identifies it as description and then we put whatever content we want for our description in the content attribute and I said this is a webpage about fish we cover all the fish in the world so again this description is used by search engines to understand what your web page is all about now there's about a maximum of 155 characters so you should only put a few sentences in here because sometimes this is actually displayed in the search results so when you go out and do a search on google it'll pull up the website and then you'll see a description right under it and I'll show you an example right now this is PBS's website i did a google search for this and here is their description so this is being pulled from that meta element description tag they put all this in a meta element that use the description value so that's what they put here you can see it's kind of being cut off so remember I told you you have about a hundred fifty-five characters you can see right here it's being cut off so again you want to keep that to a few sentences now the next one we're going to look at is key words now key words are words that a web user might search to find a particular page most search engines don't use this anymore for instance Google has said that they do not use this so they will not use this to rank your website however I usually put it in my website because some foreign search engines still very much use this so it's not a bad idea to throw a few keywords what you think people might search for so again I just put in fish because this is a fish website I put an ocean and aquarium I think I spelled aquarium wrong if so again it's just the keywords that you think people will put into Google now the next one we set to author now you'll notice we use a different attribute here so instead of using name we just use HTTP - acquit but it pretty much does the same thing and this is just putting in the author of the website so again we set the value to author and we put in our name here whoever the author of the website is and the final one tells the search engine what language your webpage is in again we use the HTTP - equiv attribute and we set this to content - language that's the value and then we use en - us to say that this is in English and again that tells the search engine what language it's in and then what country it's from in this case the u.s. I think French would be something like FR FR actually so if you want to put these in different languages you can actually look these up out on google now I will point out one thing if you do not put in a description in the browser we'll do it for you and it might not describe your website very well so again of all the meta elements I recommend you to at a minimum you use this one okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
