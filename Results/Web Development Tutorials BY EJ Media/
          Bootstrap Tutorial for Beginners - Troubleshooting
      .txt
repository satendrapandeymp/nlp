in this video we're going to do a little troubleshooting in bootstrap with the grid that we worked on earlier and basically I'm doing this video because a subscriber emailed me and indicated she was having a problem with the grid and she wanted a little bit of help so I said I would do a video on this issue because it is an issue that does prop up from time to time and let's go ahead and just load the grid up real quick here and what she did was she put in h2 heading in this main column and it added margin to it and this is sort of a weird issue that can prop up in bootstrap and it's actually not an issue with bootstrap it's an issue with CSS and actually it's working as designed it involves this situation called Reverse margins and that's pretty complicated I don't want to get into that right now but I just want to show you what she did and how we can fix it in case you run into it as well so let's go ahead and close this out and let's go ahead into our main column here what we're going to do is just go ahead and add an h2 element and we'll just right in here main element and then let's just go ahead and copy and paste this and then we'll just go ahead and close this out all right so let's save this and let's make sure we can recreate this situation and there you can see it shifted downwards so how to fix this there are two ways you can fix this and I will show you both of them in this video now maybe you want that maybe you want that margin at it and that's fine if you want to keep it like that maybe maybe that's something you're looking for but if you're not then there's a couple ways to snap that back into place now one thing we can do is use this nbsp right here and if you followed my HTML series you will remember that that allows you basically to create multiple spaces and so what we want to do is put this right before the offending element which in this case is the h2 element so I'm just going to copy and paste that right there and so let's go ahead and save this and you'll see that everything is snapped back into place and it is look at that this section now is back up where it's supposed to be now there is another way to snap this element back into place and I'm going to show you that now so let's go ahead and get rid of this and let's head over to our style sheet you'll notice that to each one of our columns we added three pixels so what you want to do - is go ahead and add the same amount of margin to whatever element is causing the issue so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this here and we're just going to put h2 right here and let's just get rid of these three rules we don't need them and so we're going to add again the same amount of margin and that should snap everything back into place let's go ahead and run this and there you can see take a look at that it worked so that's how you snap these sections back into place
