hi friends this is novo Gibran and welcome to our HTML tutorials in this video I'm going to show you how you can show two different web pages on a single page so to accomplish that we'll be using something known as the frame set right now we are the html5 does not support this frame set tag but the previous version of HTML do support it so let's it would be good just to know it in case if you require it somewhere in the future so to declare a frame set we have a tag known as frame set and you can divide this particular frame or this frame which you see on the webpage in two in two ways that is one horizontally and one vertically okay if you want to divide the plane in the vertical direction then you can use the calls parameter that stands for columns or if you want to divide the screen what your horizontally then you can go for rows that means row you want to create a row in the frame so once you have that you can will close that frame set and let us now create a frame set which will have two columns the size of each one will be 50% and the second one will also 50% since we are dividing it into the columns so we are not going to use this rows and now I have two parts in my frame so for that my what I have to do is I will have to create frame and I have to give the source of the page which I would like to show in my frame set so same one we will do for the second page now these are my two pages which I will be showing in my frame set so I will say left dot html' my left page will be left the dot HTML and my second page bill will be right dot HTML so just I will create these two pages in just a while okay so I have created these two pages this page is left page dot HTML and this page is right page dot HTML okay so now let us call this in our frame left page and the right page okay we did not run over here so it's left right okay so now we will save it we'll save these two files like it fine so now let's run this in Chrome okay if I could set it over here yes now you can see we have these two different pages this one is left page and this one is the right page and as you can see we are in the final frame dot HTML where this is our frame dot HTML file in which I have defined a frame set in that I have given two frames one with the left page and one with the right page so this is what you are seeing over here initially when we launch this page then the size of the page of the frame set will be 50/50 which means 50% of our frame set or the screen will be given to our left page and the remaining 50% will be given to the right page but if you want you can resize it the way you want like this okay so this is how you can do something with the frame set the simplest way and now let's try to do some difficult looking tasks with this frame set so here I have an image which you can create like it will be a different thing to create the it's different to show just two pages but to do something like this let us this be on a different page this home being on different page this about being on different page generation of different page and this description being a different page so overall we want to show five different pages on a single web page so for that what we need to do is first we will divide our web page into two main pages two different columns like this one with the first part and this being the second part and then we will leave this first part we'll call a page over here and in the second part we will again divide this into two different rows and then this first row we will divide it into three different columns so how we'll see that in just a moment let me go back to or notepad and over here first of all let me clear everything and what I will do is I will make it 20 and 80 so what I am doing over here this part being smaller I am assigning this size to be as 20 percent and this size being the largest one I am assigning it as 80 percent so once we are done now I can have two parts in it that is left and this one being the right part okay so for the left part I need to have a frame and the filename I will give as left dot HTML and then for the right part as you can see over here I don't have a particular page I want this page to be divided more further so for that in place of giving the right page I will define over here one more frame set frame set and now this will be divided into rows why because I want this part to be divided into two rows this one will be the first row and this area will be the second row so this will be again 20% and 80% okay so now we have a frame set for our right side so yes we have it now this frame set in this frame set we would get two lines get two rows which one first one is the upper row and the second well will be the lower row and now we want our where isn't it here it is we want our upper row to be divided furthermore so before that what we will do is for the lower row we will create a frame whose SRC or the source will be the de s CR IEP description dot HTML like it so this page will be over a description dot HTML and now I would like to break my upper part into some more partitions how I will do it I will make one more frame set that will be of columns because I wanted it to be different columns or so we'll close the frame set and now within that now I want my this frame to be divided into three parts so we'll do it we'll make it 30% 30% and the fourth one will be 40% so now in this frame set what I have got is three different pages so which will be like this here I have my first page this will be my second page and this will be my third page so then we'll create the frame they'll say just be it for the first one I will say home dot html' second one will be about dot html' the third one will be registration dot html' so now we have all this files and we have closed all this all of them so here you can check this frameset is closed by this class prim set and this frame set ends over here this frame set ends over here so first let's create all of this file files that is left dot HTML home dot HTML about dot HTML and the registration notice table let me remove all this fine so we are good to go now I have already created all of these pages these are just estimates nothing else you can see for the left dot HTML I have just created three links on it and if the home dot HTML just written home in about nothing in just a restriction just registration description nothing that's it so what we are doing is everything over here so if I save it and let's run this in chrome and here you can see we have the format created as you can see on the left side we had these three links with the home about and registration and then description in the centre so if you see we have the links in the left side home about registration you can design these pages the way you want but just for me keeping it as simple as possible we have done it like this so this is how you can do and complex designing in the HTML page using the frameset hope you understood what I wanted to explain to you and thanks for watch the video
