hi in this video of HTML we are going to cover the formatting tags formatting tags as the name says which is used to modify the output alright so how we can do the formatting of a Chimel document we can do it from these formatting tags which are coming now like the bold italics underline superscript subscript like bold italic underline you know when you want to show some text at the bottom like if you are from chemistry background there is something called h2o so 2 is at the bottom and is in a smaller size that is this subscript similarly superscript like 10 square X square so that is the superscript tag big small will basically modify the size of the font from the current font size like big will make it bigger as a name say the small tag will make it smaller all right and mono spaced molar space like when you use different alphabets like i/o are having different area consumption like I take lesser space than oh so if you want that all the characters should take us equal space then that part you can use the mono space tag so let's see all these tags practically and see how they change the appearance or the formatting of the webpage so now in context of formatting tags I will start things with the bold tag that is represented by the letter B so inside B tag I will write like this is bold so as you can see this particular text is shown as bold similarly I can go for the eye tag that is the italics so it will convert a simple text into the italics font so as you can see this is italics all right so just to put some gap I will use the BR tag here alright and I will do that again after the italics now you tagged I will use for the unlined so basically if you want to underline some important text out in a paragraph or maybe for any purpose you can use this underline tag that is the you tack alright so as you can see these are things in case you want to put multiple tags in a same so you will have to apply the leaf o in that for example for a single text I want to use B as well you as well and I as well alright so this is my text is the text now after that I'll have to first close I then I'll close you and then I will close the bold tag alright so this is what I call the leaf Oh last in first out so this was the tag which opened at the last I will close it first so here is the text all right it's bold it's italic and underlined similarly we do have a tag here called strike but before that let me put a br again yeah so now let's talk about the strike tag which basically strikes out a particular test which you will put inside all right let's say this is strike tag so I just use the world strike between this strike tag so that will be okay I didn't close that all right so only this one will be strike doubt similarly in formatting I do have some more tags that is the superscript and subscript tag so let's say if I want to use something like a subscript so for that I will use like H then I will use the super script tag that is subscript tag that is sub - and then I'll flows they subtag alright and then oh so let me break the line again so you can see let me increase the font size it is this subscript when you want some tag to be shown in this subscript manner similarly we do have the superscript like if I want to write 10 cube so 10 then I will use superscript cube and then I will close that superscript alright so this is the 10 cube so now let's continue with some more tags that is the small and big tag so basically for that what I will do this is small text alright and I have enclosed that inside the small tag so this particular text will be smaller than the before text right like this is is written before than this so this one is comparatively bigger than this particular text all right similarly we do have the big tag all right that is 4 in that whatever I'll do this is big big text all right so I'll close it here and as you can see this one is comparatively bigger than this text all right so these are some times which you can use for the formatting purposes
