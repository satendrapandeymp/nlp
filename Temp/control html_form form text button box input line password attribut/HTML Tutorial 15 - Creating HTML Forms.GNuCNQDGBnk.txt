hey everyone Jamie here from technical cafe comm welcome to your 15 HTML tutorial in the last tutorial we talked about adding backgrounds to our pages both plain old color backgrounds and then we talked about adding image backgrounds to our web pages so in this tutorial we're going to be talking something about something a little different and that's going to be creating HTML forms and what a form does is it just takes information from the user and it sends it over to another page provided that's what you want us to do so here's an example of a form you've probably seen these all over the Internet that's a standard login form where you take a username and password and then you click login it'll send it over to a page to actually log the user and so now let me just show you how it works here so for our username I'll insert my name Jamie and the password I'll just say password and you'll notice here that the username is actually in text in the password has bullet dots that you can't see what it is should somebody be standing over your shoulder or something like that and there's actually a way to tell the form that that's what you want it to be so let's just if we click login here it'll take us to the process up PHP page and I haven't actually created one so it's going to say the file isn't found but if you did create a page you could then do all sorts of things with the username and password information that was submitted and another thing that I want you to keep in mind is that we use the post form of submitting and what that does is it basically sends it without displaying it in the URL the other form is get now we'll talk about those a little bit more in a couple minutes but let's get into the code here so you can see what's going on here okay so this is the code for the password and username form that we have here so we have here is they have the form and a couple attributes and then we have the three different inputs with the button being one of the inputs so I'm let's just clear this out here and save it come over here and refresh and I'll take you through how to set up a form so we'll create our HTML tags here come through with our body next and then we'll add our hitter on top of that our title and we'll call this creating HTML forms we'll save that and we'll come down and we'll add our we'll add a header here in h3 and we'll call this creating HTML forms just to you know provide a little bit of information so I'll come over here and refresh and here's our title and here's our header so let's get into actually creating the form itself so I one of the other things that you notice that when we had the form up was that we had a some text so please log in so let's go ahead and add that so we'll say we'll use a paragraph tag and we'll say please log in below so we'll save that come over here and refresh and here's our please log in below so let's actually start creating the form that we can use to log the user in and now you don't have to create a login form you can create whatever you want but in this tutorial I'm just going to show you the basics of how to create a form now I think the glog in form is probably the most recognizable because they're all over the place you can also do like a contact form or other types of forms so let's just come over here and the way we're going to create a form is we're going to use a set of tags called the form tags and now it's similar to the how-to how you could create a list with the UL or o L so with a form there's going to be an opening form tag and a closing form tag and anything between these two tags is going to be the information for the form so it's going to contain the form fields any buttons and any text that you're going to include within the form so it's similar to a list in the aspect that you kind of outline what you want to do and that anything in the list would go between the two list tags so it's similar to that so let's just go ahead and save this come over and refresh and notice that there's nothing on the page and this because we haven't actually added any anything to our form we just said that we're going to be creating one so let's come in here and one of the first things going to do like we did in our form previously is we're going to create a text field what we're going to do is we're going to call this this space how we would go about creating one we used saying input type equals text and this is basically it this is how you create a text box so you'd use the input tag and then you'd add within that input tag you would add an attribute type now this is just specifying the type of input that you want you can have a password input you can have a button input you can have a text input so let's go ahead and say text because that's what we want and we'll just come over here and just add a little forward slash to indicate that we're closing it you don't need to do that you don't need a closing tag on this either it's just one tag input unlike these two here but I just add it there just because it's kind of a good convention to have I guess so let's go ahead and save this come over here to our page and refresh and you'll notice that now we have a text box so we can enter in you know whatever we want in this text box you can enter in a however much data you want and there is a way that we can go about limiting how much data we put in but for this tutorial we're not going to worry about doing that so we have our box so what we're going to do is we're going to call it we're going to create a name for it we're going to create it and call it user name so we'll save that come over here and you can see that we have a user name box so the next thing I'm going to do is create the same thing but for a password so we'll come down here and we'll say password and then we'll add a little coal in there and we're going to use the same exact tag input we'll just create a slash but instead of using the type equals text attribute we're going to use the type equals and we're going to say password you can still use the text if you want to if you're creating a different type of form like in contact form and you want to include maybe an email address you can use text but for the purpose of a password it's good to use the password type for the attribute that way the words get masked as bullet points so we'll save that come over here and we'll refresh and the notice that we have our username a box where user name and then a password in box for the password the difference is here if we type at asdf and we type it in the password field the password blocks it outs that nobody can see what you're actually typing okay so let's come over here and going to add a button so for the button what we need to do it's just we're going to create another input type so basically using the input tab tag in the type attribute and that will close that and for that to create a button all you need to do is create just type in submit and that it's going to create a submit button so if we save that now we come back over to our Firefox refresh you'll notice that we have our username box our password box and our submit button and if you click the submit button nothing's going to happen so if we type in some information here in the password password we'll submit the query and you'll still notice that nothing happens the boxes just get blanked out and Firefox asked if I'd like to remember the password so what we're going to do first is we're going to actually change the name of this of this button from submit query to log in a submit query is just the default but since we're creating a login script we're going to basically change it to login so what we're going to do is add another attribute to the input tag so we're going to say name or value rather equals and then a some parentheses it's a quotation marks rather and remember it's important to add the quotation marks um especially if you're using other programming languages than HTML because might not work correctly so we're going to say I log in save that come over and take a look and you'll notice that our button change to login I still has the same function of doing nothing and that's just because we haven't told it to do anything yet so what we're going to do over here just to set up the input types so first we you'll notice that we had our form and it was actually sending us to the process PHP page when I was actually on the w3 schools website a little earlier that they were using ASP for their example but for our example here we're going to be using PHP now it's basically we're going to do is we're going to say form we're going to add another attribute to the form tag the top form tag and we're going to say action equals and then simply quotation marks here and what the action does is it's basically telling the browser what page to send the data in this form so basically the Pat the input type text that's going to whatever text you enter in this box whatever characters you enter for the password to another web page where you can do things with it perhaps add it to a MySQL database or display it to the user or something like that so we're going to be doing is we're going to be telling the form where the brows are where to send this information and I haven't actually created the process up PHP page but we'll just create one anyway and I this this can differ depending on what your page what you're using if you're using ASP it's going to obviously be something else or if you name the page something different it's going to be something else so if we save this and come over here to our page and refresh and we click on the login button you'll notice that it now takes us to the process top PHP page so it's basically going to send the data from these two these two inputs to the process top PHP page which hasn't been created yet that's why we're getting a file not found but have had it been created it would have been sent over there so let's say we enter in some text here and we'll say our password is the word password never a good idea but we'll create it that way and we click login nothing will happen so let's come back to our code here and now we're going to add a couple more attributes to the to the username and password fields here so after the text attribute we're going to type in name equals and then some quotation marks and the name attribute is basically going to be used for when you send it to another page so when we send it to the PHP page login or process PHP for for example it's going to be we're going to be trying to we might want to store these values in two variables in PHP and this might sound confusing so don't worry about it you're not this tutorial isn't really based on PHP but I'm just kind of showing you how to set it up for when you do decide to go about learning PHP if that's something you're interested in so we're going to give this name we're going to call it username so basically when this gets sent to the PHP process top PHP page it's going to be able you're going to be able to identify it and grab the information by calling it username if you called it input username or name you can call it whatever you want as long as you remember to use the same input name on the PHP page so I'm going to do that and for the we'll do the same thing use our name attribute and call it password and we'll save that come over here and refresh I enter in our information and we'll login and you'll notice now that we give it that we've given the name that it'll say private process stop PHP question mark username equals Jaime and password equals password so this is actually using a get method to send it to the process type PHP page and now these are the names that we created username and password within our code here and this is what's actually going to be sent to the page where we can do whatever we want with it so let's go back to our page here and we'll refresh it just get my name out of there so that we'll come back here to our code here and we're also going to give our our submit button a name and it's not going to show up it's not going to really be used for much right now but we'll call it submit and in PHP later on you might want to check to see if the submit button is actually been clicked and you can do that by grabbing the submit name here so this is basically how I would go about creating a basic HTML form for right now if you're going to use it you're not going to really need the name attributes here but this is up to you whether to use it when you start using PHP or maybe some JavaScript these might come in handy and now one other thing that I want to go over here is another attribute for the form tag and that's actually going to be the method equals and then some quotation marks and this attribute is basically saying how the data from the form is going to be sent to the process PHP page here so the method that we've been using here the Jamie and we're enter password here is actually a get method because the username and password are both shown in the URL here you'll notice I actually spelt password wrong but they're shown in the URL in for the example of sending a password you don't really want it to be shown in the URL because if someone's standing behind you or looks in your history or something they can see that your password is password so what we can do to prevent that this is a post method so you enter in post right here save it come back to your form here refresh we'll see our password is password and we'll click login and you'll notice that it gets sent without adding anything to the URL is that way nobody can see what your username or password is to see what information is in the URL so just a different thing you want to do there's different examples or different uses for get and post you know depending on what you're trying to do with your website so that's basically how to go about creating a simple form it might seem confusing at first but once you get the hang of it and start doing it it gets easier and easier so if you have any questions please feel free to post them in the comments you can send me an email by using the contact page on technical cafe and that's actually a form using the post method I believe to send it to my email address and you can also use Twitter send me a tweet Jamie mcg on Twitter you can use the technical cafe Twitter which is twitter.com slash technical cafe you can just leave a comment below so I thank you for watching and have a great day
