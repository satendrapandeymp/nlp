hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number thirteen and in this tutorial I thought it would be best that we practice our CSS just a little bit more and the way we're going to do that is we're going to work with some font properties okay so the font properties in CSS obviously allow us to do some really cool stuff to all the font on our website so let's go ahead and just add in a paragraph quickly so we'll just write something silly like the quick red fox jumped over the lazy Brown dogs back and I managed to top that without any typos can you believe it okay and that's actually a sentence that uses every single letter in the alphabet funny enough okay cool so now we've got this sentence over here let's see if we can actually edit it a little bit with some CSS styling okay so if we run this in Firefox now you can see it gets printed out quite default this is Times New Roman font I think so I mean it's just it's not interesting and imagine every single website you went to was always using Times New Roman and was always the size obviously doesn't look very appealing so let's try and change that okay so what we're going to do now is just select this paragraph by its element name so remember we use a selector in CSS just to select the element that we want to style okay then we're going to put in those curly braces and inside here we use our properties and values okay so one of the font properties that we can change is the font family okay and the font family is basically what kind of font you're using so like I said by default it's Times New Roman okay but we can change this so let's just change it to something like Arial and you have to spell this right unfortunately okay Arial and now when we save this and go back and click refresh you can see that the text has quite clearly changed from Times New Roman to Arial okay and again we can change this to Tahoma or anything else that is actually installed on your computer okay now when it comes to using fonts that aren't installed on the user's computer so if you want to use a special font that you may be downloaded from the internet that gets a little bit complicated so I'm not going to be speaking about that in this video but for now you guys can just be aware that you can use any kind of font as long as it's a font that's like standard to your computer so there are some fonts that like differ from Windows to Mac to Linux or whatever but there are some that are across all platforms so you might just want to get used to that or just read up a bit about that okay and then the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is a font property called fund weight okay and the font weight is basically whether your text should be bold or not bold so if you type in bold here then you'll get bolded text otherwise if you type in normal then your text should be normal so let's go ahead and actually just save that as bold again quickly there we go okay save this come back here click refresh and as you can see font-weight:bold makes our text bold now we don't only have to use bold or normal we could also use values that go from 100 through to 900 okay and those basically mean 100 is normal and then 900 is fully bold if you go ahead and put in something like 500 then that is only half as bold if that makes sense it's not it's not fully bold it's just half as bold as it should have been not that we can actually see a difference here because when I click refresh well it changes slightly so just be aware of that if you want to be able to change like your text to be bold but not as bold you can use those numbers as well but let's just go ahead and put that back as bold then the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is the font style property so font - style and this is basically if you want your text to be italicized or not so if you go ahead and you type in italic then it'll turn everything into italics and again the other value for this is normal so if you want your text to appear normal then you can go ahead and just print type in normal there as well doesn't really matter okay so you've got bold italics font family what else we can also work with something called the font size property okay and font size is basically how big do you want your text obviously so you can give this a measurement in pixels and by default I think it's around 12 pixels so let's make it something really big that's kind of noticeable so we'll go ahead and say 24 pixels okay and now it should actually pretty much double in size so we're going to go ahead and click refresh you can see the text is much bigger okay so those are the four different properties that we can work with in CSS when we're working with proper fonts but we can actually make this shorter because we can actually put all of these properties into one okay and to do that all we have to do is type in the word font so that's the property we're going to access and then you can start off with typing the word bold if you want your text to be bold if you don't want your text to be bolded then you can actually leave this stage out we can also type in italics if we want it to be in italics but if we don't need italics then we can also leave that section out and then the last two are the size so let's say 14 pixels and then the last one is the font family so let's go ahead and say Tahoma and now we should get all of this printed out but now we've done we've changed all four of those properties in one line so that's one really cool CSS trick you can just go ahead and do it all in one line just like that okay so that's actually all I have for you guys in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys in the next one
