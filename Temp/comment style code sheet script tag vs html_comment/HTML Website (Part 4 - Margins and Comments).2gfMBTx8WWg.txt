hi guys welcome back this is Chris again and we are now in our fourth installment of creating a website with HTML with no special software whatsoever what we're about to do now is bump up the banner wrapper or the banner container to the top of the page we're going to bring it all the way to the top and we'll bring the content container so that way it's touching the bottom of the browser here okay so let's get started I'm going to open up my word processing program to get back to the HTML code and the first thing I want to do is I want to take a look at the actual body tag okay so I'm going to end the olive with a semicolon there and I'm going to add margin - top colon zero for the zero position which is the top and then I'm going to end up with a semicolon and I'm also going to say margin - bottom colon zero semicolon so that way the page goes all the way down to the bottom so that's all we need to do there let's see what that looks like save and refresh all right so you can see how now the the banner wrapper for that table it's bumped up all the way to the top and the final table that last table for the content it's already at the bottom okay so we'll use that layout moving forward so the next thing we're gonna do now that we taking care of the margins for the top and bottom is we're gonna practice creating what they call comments in HTML code and a comment is basically an area that's a benign piece of code that actually doesn't get read by the browser it's really just for you to keep yourself organized when you're looking at code and if you remember this first table is your contents for your banner okay this is your shell for your banner so if you go above the bit of above the table and you start out with an open bracket and then you want the exclamation point and then - - and then you can say whatever you want at this point about what this next section of code is so we're gonna just say banner and then to end the tag it's another - - and then close your bracket so again as long as you have this structure for this tag this is considered a comment tag and again it's not read by the browser nothing actually will display in the browser relating to this it's just for you to organize yourself inside the code so just to give you an example I'm gonna save this and refresh and you can see how nothing has changed on the physical page so let's go ahead and comment the next table which is right here and if you remember that second table was for our navigation so again I'm gonna say open bracket exclamation point - - and then this one's going to be navigation and then another - - close your bracket and I'm just gonna space this out even more okay again it doesn't matter how much space I have in between here that's not rendered by the browser so again I'm just going to space it out as much as I can so that way it's more aesthetically pleasing for me while I'm working okay so now I have a banner section a navigation section and then this last one was for content so I'll do one more comment tag here okay that looks good I'm gonna save and refresh and you can see none of those comments are visible on the page it's just a really handy feature that you might find yourself using from time to time okay finally the last thing we're gonna do is we're going to start defining the area inside of you navigation and split these up into four separate cells that will represent four buttons a home button and about us button maybe an FAQ s button and then a contact us so we'll split this up in four equal parts so we're gonna need a few columns here okay right now we have a table for our navigation but it's really just one row in one column so we're gonna turn this into four column table here okay so let's look at the code for the navigation so right now if you're remembering the last activity we saw that this was a table row and this has ends the row and then in the middle the TD means that's like one column okay right now I'm gonna just add some text inside of that column I'm just gonna say button one okay and let's see what happens once I save and refresh okay so button one ends up in that cell so what you want to do now is you can copy that whole chunk of code with a ctrl C I'm going to move down just a bit in control V and that what that does is it creates a second column and I'm just going to call that button to file save and refresh and you see where that places that way out here okay because right now we only have two columns so the first column starts here and ends here and then the second column starts here and ends here one thing that we might find yourself doing now is since we saw that this first column starts here and ends here it would be nice to actually Center the information inside of each cell so instead of centering content within each column it might be easier to just do it for the row itself that way you only have to do it one time so if you come up to the table row tag and just expand that a little bit and just say a line equals : Center : now everything inside of this row will be centered so I'm going to file save and refresh and let's take a look so right now we have two columns one here and one here and whatever information is is inside of each column is centered great so now like we said before we want to add four buttons so we want to have four columns so we have two more columns to build I'm going to ctrl C to copy ctrl V to paste and I'll call this button 3 okay come down one more and another v to paste and I'll just call that one button for so again these are automatically going to be centered as well because they are nested inside of this row okay so I'm just gonna do one more file save refresh and take a look okay so now late in the next exercise what we'll do is we'll start dropping in some content inside of these tables we'll practice making a quick banner as an image file and we'll drop it into this container and we'll make four simple buttons that we'll place inside of the navigation container thanks for watching
