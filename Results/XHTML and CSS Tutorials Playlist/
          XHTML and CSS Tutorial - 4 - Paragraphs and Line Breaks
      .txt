what is going on guys welcome to your fourth XHTML and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is teaching you guys about paragraphs and line breaks so if you haven't noticed already what I did is I deleted everything out of our body so we just have a blank empty body with no tags in because that was the stuff we learned about on the last oral in this tutorial we're on to bigger and better things so anyways you should have a website that when you refresh it it's just blank again so like I was saying let's go ahead and learn about paragraphs now first of all if you don't know what a paragraph is then I don't even know how you figure it out how to watch this tutorial because you're just clueless but a paragraph is basically chunks of text and it makes articles and magazines and text on a website easier to read so you would think that whenever you created a website that making paragraphs would be essential to that so I know where you're thinking Bucky if I want to create a paragraph on my website it's simple just go ahead into my body and type in any text Bucky is the best ever paragraph one go ahead end it make a new paragraph a couple lines down and said because he loves bacon eats it too and a bunch of typos perfect so one paragraph to paragraph let's save this and take a look at our awesome website with paragraphs refresh it woah WTF Bucky why the heck is this all on one line that's not what I typed in here we'll check it out XHTML is something called what is it called what's the technical name for I think it's like whitespace insensitive or something and what this means is even though you see all these spaces and you know new paragraphs your browser looks at all of this in one long line of code so it doesn't know that you have spaces or you want new paragraphs here you need to tell it explicitly so whenever we create a website and we want paragraphs we have to surround the sections of text that we want in paragraphs with special tags now we do this well let's just go ahead and do this the special tag for paragraph is P so let's go ahead and make this paragraph by starting it here and ending it here and we'll make this a paragraph two and we'll put a P right here and a P right there so now we actually have these two paragraphs instead of just random text so before your browser look this is one big sentence oh my god this girl keeps texting me let me see what she's saying I'll read it to you guys because she's probably like quit reading my text and all your tutorials well too bad quit texting me want to try and teach OMG my final was terrible I hate my life yet I'm definitely not texting her back so anyways let's go ahead and I lost track so anyways your browser used to see one long line of text so now what we're telling it to do is alright make this text into paragraph and makes this text into a paragraph so let's go ahead and save this and see what we got instead of this long line of text right here let's refresh it and BAM look at that two brand-new beautiful beautiful beautiful paragraphs I'm getting a little excited there but alright so now that's good at all but whatever saying all right Bucky I kinda am going for this look but what I want is I want this to be on the next line so we already know that with paragraphs we have a space in between just like you know a regular paragraph would but let's go ahead and make it on the next line instead of you know having a space in between so go ahead delete all your PDF tags and we already know this we already know you can't do that because when we save it it's going to turn into one long line again so what is you know the trick that we can do to you know make it just on the next line kind of like it's like here well we can't surround it in paragraph tags because that will add a space in between any time we want to simulate you know just hitting Enter on the keyboard and moving the text to the next line we need to add something called line-break now you know how all the tags we created so far with exception of this one has an opening and a closing and that is so your website knows where to start in order to end where your body knows where to start and where to end where your head knows we're starting in where your title knows where to start and where to end and everything in between it is the title well whenever you hit make a line break you don't really need a beginning and an end of a line break that's like doing something like dumb like when I press ENTER on my keyboard it doesn't need to know when you started or when you end it it just needs to know when I press ENTER go the next line plain and simple so the tag for a line break is going to be a little bit different than an opening and closing tag let me go go ahead and show you guys what the tag is so let's go ahead and move this all on one line first of all and in between it we're going to put a special tag and that's BR and after it go ahead and make your forward slash so AC in normal closing tags we put the forward slash before the keyword but in this one we're putting it after the keyword anytime you have a single tag you put the forward slash after the keyword and this is the same for line breaks images on something called a horizontal line or horizontal rule but anyways we'll get into that later so anyways let's go ahead and save this and here's what's going to happen it's going to say Bucky is the best ever on the first line then it's going to hit a break which is pretty much going to shift everything down to the very next line and then it's going to say because he loves bacana in Yahtzee - hmm interesting so anyways let's go ahead and refresh this and bam look at that it breaks right here and on the very next line it continues with the rest of its crap so that's how you make a basic line break and why those are useful so um something that that may be really useful for is like if you're making an address but Bucky Roberts 1 3 3 1 whatever very live ID even on my dress right now but anyways that's that so let's go ahead and let me create a basic website real quick with the tools that we learned so far we're going to start out with a header which is at h1 and end it with h1 now everything in between here is going to be a header and be like best website ever with a exclamation point now under this header I might want a paragraph so let's go ahead I make all my text first some people do this some people write this is my paragraph make sure you got a couple typos in there and then they make tags but what I like to do is I like to make both the text first and then fill in whatever I want in the middle that way I don't forget about one tag or the other so let's go ahead and after this we might like make like a ch2 h2 and right this is the second header and let's go ahead and make a paragraph under this one and right this is the second paragraph good enough and now let's go ahead and add a line break be our space forward slash and after this right and now I'm done with this tutorial pretty bad but anyways you get the point so let's go ahead and save this and so we guys let me make sure I didn't mess up anything before I embarrass myself ii i'll bear's myself some other way so let's go ahead and take a look at this beautiful website header 1 best website ever and here's my first paragraph and then header 2 it's a little bit smaller but still noticeable and here's my second paragraph with a line break in the middle and about 2000 typos so there you have it there is how you create headers paragraphs line breaks and all that good stuff so in the next tutorial I think we're ready to move on to something a little more advanced so don't go ahead and start creating awesome websites so far because you know if this is all you know then you probably can't get a job with Mike soft just yet so hold on to your horses and wait the next tutorial but for now in the meantime go ahead and hit that subscribe button and think guys for watching and uh I'll see you guys later
