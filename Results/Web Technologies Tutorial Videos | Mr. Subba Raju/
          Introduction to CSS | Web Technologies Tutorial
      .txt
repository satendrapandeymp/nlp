hi guys welcome to nourish a Technologies this is Subaru in this video session will observe cascading stylesheets mechanism what is CSS why CSS where exactly we are implementing cascading stylesheets will observe one by one in this video series before this video session who are ready to practice cascading style sheets please try to watch all HTML videos in that videos I provided HTML 4.0 related tags standards web related information and deprecated tags also provided now cascading style sheets what is the meaning of cascading what is the meaning of style what is the meaning of sheets cascading means inheriting style means collection of properties sheet means dot CSS extension so cascading editing styles from one section to another section style is a global attribute it supports collection of properties sheet is dot CSS extension file already made very clearly that but where we are using where HTML gets failed there we are using cascading style sheet in HTML a few drawbacks existed those drawbacks CSS 1.0 recovered are 2.0 recovered CSS 3.0 recovered so every HTML level drawbacks cascading style sheets of mechanism perfectly recovering now a simple example purpose what is the duty of cascading we come to know so simply one example we can see right now I am coming to my text editor just I am writing doctype HTML header section title CSS properties title closed had a section closed body inside already the program explained to you but little bit differently i'm going to so body tag and some attributes in that one i am showing to you today background is equal to an image path i am providing html5 dot the PNG I provided come to browser run that yes so actually you added one time image it is showing n times C you're increasing means the number of images decreasing you're decreasing means space size number of images increasing now I am increasing page size images decreases but I don't want all these very images actually added only one type I required one time only so that time this kind of drawback using HTML we are unable to control that time we are going to style attribute style equal to background-repeat:no-repeat there is a property perfect so all images out one image only available right this image good available here now some more properties we can observe for example I want to put some text on this image let me Google I am writing what is html5 simple one query throw some result coming there I am putting some kind of text whatever text coming here and I want to copy yeah we'll take this text from there and copy it and some text you can put on that so right now I am taking you this page just the text copied it multiple times you can do that save it come back and refresh whenever you are moving this page page text removing as well as image also moving my requirement is amaze must not move text should move that is my requirement that time there is no property in HTML to stick the text backside so that time we are doing style attribute feature come back to style attribute and style is equal to background attachment fix save it refresh it come on move it now M is not moving but text moving with a simple and perfect property background attachment fixed I want this image center of the page and this align should be perfect that align perfect we know already text aligned just t5 come back and I am writing background position Center refresh perfect increase the image or increase the page decrease the page but image never leave the center position observer clearly write the text right side alignment is not proper left side perfectly viable margin but right side not that much perfect that time we are using text align I made already that pro body takes to align just t5 like this a page simple effectively visible as per the real-time industry to do like this effective development HTML with the CSS combination possible of course static web pages only but perfection possible now to do more effectively that so we need to learn cascading style sheets of mechanism what are the features available and when these features are released in which version 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 sass less different different cascading style sheets related features available now once we are coming I implemented very clearly cascading style sheets meaning I wrote a big information related to cascading style sheets and first I will try to show you the information completely related to CSS right to remove it what are the features of CSS first CSS has a big list of features flexibility meaning any browser any technology and any platform codes rendering yes it is almost all equal to cascading mechanism rendering means bring accessibility on any technology area easily we can access accessibility is a simple and effective easy manage one stylesheet implement with the completely Styles attached to one number of HTML files you need any modification do one time and it is reflecting all HTML files so this is easily manage all the Styles global change so one time you are modifying or one type of doing changes it is applicable to the respect to pages lot of time so whenever required any client updation any deletion we can do within fraction of seconds because stylesheet is a global easily we can maintain it does not require any kind of programming language information you must not be a great programmer so just you know be the basics of HTML easily we can do with the CSS inline styles for every line we can apply styles already best example as shown to you in my previous video session regarding span tag same like that we can apply inline Styles internal style sheets we are calling as embedded style sheets these style you can apply page level in line we can apply line level external style sheets in real time projects level we are using 1 external sheet we are creating and we are attaching to n number of HTML files so next one page load faster performance wise excellent cascading style sheets ultimate simply it is providing efficient performance and page load faster I said already superior style HTML is great Styles great styles as just now I give in to an example to you related to background properties not only that number of properties in upcoming video sessions effectively we can see examples multi device compatibility yes I said already any device any good JIT any widget CSS has a perfect compatibility global web standards yes w3c standards who developed HTML and that organization is recommending now cascading style sheets mechanism also we cannot separate HTML and CSS these are the two static markup language and statistic stylish language is equal to a perfect statistic web page so even cascading style sheet mechanism these are the main features I shown to you more features available main what are the main features available I shown to you regarding CSS versions there the number of versions available first time in 1996 actually 1.0 release it 97 2.0 release and our 98 here is approximate in 1999 CSS 3.0 released and recently 4.0 release it but before these versions how syntax effectively working what are the preconditions yes let's we'll concentrate one by one so when you are observing CSS syntax one structure file I will show you yes now CSS structure we can see this is a structure if you are seeing CSS structure it is it is looking like HTML structure then you have a doubt CSS file extension is dot CSS but you are showing it HTML document structure yes by default client-side any kind of technology extinction is dot HTML you can save dot CSS extinction also definitely we can see in upcoming videos what is external stylesheets integration but right now structure we can try to understand this is header section I am declaring here and I am cascading to here cascading one word I said very clearly so you are declaring in the header section this see is comes under logical part you are showing here you are showing here so cascading from header section to body section like that example practically I am showing to you rights concentrate one by one doctype HTML header section and directly style type is equal to text or CSS and do what is develop spline to you just one property I am providing stylesheet close at the close body inside whatever tag name you said you can use welcome to CSS dot HTML extinction is saved this is actually as per syntax means this is a selector this is a properity this is value so structure I am showing to you now this structure once you understood now I am moving from here to syntax just lets will concentrate one or two minutes on the syntax it is a basic syntax now in this basic syntax if you are observing correctly made up of three properties select our property value what is the selector Styles reusability what is a property like an attribute or behavior value related to property these three combination very clearly I am showing to you the syntax h1 is a selector property value combination declaration and property value combination is declaration remember in CSS level syntax correctly a property value separating with : a declaration completely separating with semicolon in CSS one property having more than one word every second word starts with I fun and already shown font size color you can observe font size you can observe color only single word happy font size towards second word I started with the iPhone same in JavaScript every second word starts with capital letter these are the syntactical rules as a software engineer these words need to remember perfectly so now the decoration part come back to my example and my example I'll show you here color blue I said so this is this is a selector so here we can write selector and this is color is the properity blue is a value so you want to see that I will show you definitely first let me save that and let me run perfect any browser browser compatibility problem is not there 100% browser friendly so any one you can so here yes now for example you want to increase that yes now come back use another property for two size see the second word 20 pixels of course here also by default pixels only so this is syntactical I am showing to you font the family see second word any word you any family you can use Tahoma come on right like this we can applied you can use these many families available here any one of families you can try to select so basically in this session step by step I am coming CSS CSS advantages features that means advantages means and after that I explain to you very clearly structure now I shown to the structure and syntax here we can implement event comments also what our comments generally comments are non executable statements or ignore statements using these comments we can declare in the scripting user-defined statements in CSS comments we can declare with the help of this notation same like c programming language /oz click ass trick forward slash right I am showing that one also practically now for example font family another line /s trick I am using again these two properties I do not want one property I am showing so as trick forward slash come back blue color disappear because comment yes perfect now I want to multi-line comments same one you can take and you can and say I am going to copy paste again times new roman' automatically because by default Times New Roman size control so these are the comments only one comment notation available in cascading style sheets so this is the fundamental session on cascading style sheets catch me for more videos on
