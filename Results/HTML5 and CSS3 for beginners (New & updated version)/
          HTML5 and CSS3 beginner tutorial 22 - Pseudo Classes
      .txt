hey youtuber how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 22 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about pseudo classes so for those of you guys who don't know maybe English is not your first language pseudo means fake so pseudo class is like a fake class in other words it's not a class that we get to make or add to our elements it just happens to be there and we can style our elements using that class so if that sounds confusing let me just go ahead and show you an example and hopefully everything will be clear right so let's add a paragraph over here I'm just gonna say this is a paragraph doesn't really matter make sure you make typos cuz won't work otherwise there's always gonna be that one guy who takes me seriously and okay styling there's nothing here and if I take a look at this in my browser right now let's hit refresh so there I have a pair ago host and maybe I should just zoom in to make it a little bit more clear you guys right so here we have a paragraph and we can style this paragraph using a pseudo class I'm gonna select the paragraph using an element selector which in this case is just the P tag and then I'm gonna add in a colon now what that colon means is hey CSS listen up we're about to use a pseudo class right now and the pseudo class I want to use or select is going to be hover because most elements have the pseudo class available and so what that means is when you are hovering over this element I want to give us some kind of different styling so right now this paragraph is exactly the same when I hover over it it's still exactly the same right but let me change the color of the text to read on hover and come back and refresh and now you can see the paragraph still looks normal nothing's changed but as soon as I hover over it the text has now changed to red right and actually if I hover off of it now hover over here on the end you can see the text and the paragraph still changes to red because the size of the elements like I said in previous tutorials a paragraph is a block level element so if I add a border oops if I add a border to this let's just make it two pixels solid green right come back and hit refresh you'll see what as I hover over it the border goes all the way to the end because the size of the element takes up the full width of the browser so that's why even when I hover over here it lights up so you just need to always pay attention to how big your element is whenever you're using a hover class like this now an example of where this is useful is not only for paragraphs or for you know a block that you want to change the color of right but we use pseudo classes like this on links almost every single time we style a website so let me just remove this styling and I'm gonna jump back over to this main pot and let's change this up a little bit I'm gonna make it a link so I'm gonna add in my a tag we'll give that an href of HTTP dub dub dub google.com right and I'm just gonna say this is a link to Google doesn't really matter if I make typos I should what the fix in them okay so now when I hit refresh you can see I've got this plain old blue link as I hover over it you can see the cursor changes it's no longer an arrow when I'm hovering over it in fact we have the little hand thing right and when I click on this and visit Google and come back you can see the color of the link has now changed it's purple instead of blue right so I'm just gonna refresh or well how do i how do i clear this history clear recent history and [Music] know where is the clear button look at my browser I don't know is anybody else got this problem on Mac for some reason now that I've updated I have to pull my browser window to the other side and then history clear recent history and now I get the full window now I can say clear alright it's such a weird problem anyway come back and hit refresh so now we've got the look the the link looking normal again and I want to style this too to look a little bit different so let's say a normal link we can give it that color right color blue so now the link will always be blue but let's take away the text decoration so text a decoration let's say none and that'll get rid of the underline because right now it's underlined and I don't want that right but we can select another class that or another pseudo class that a link has which is hover which I just showed you guys and we can change the color of the text on hover to red right but links also have another pseudo class which is active and active is while you're clicking down on the link so you can see by default while I'm clicking down on the link the link turns red and then when I let go it turned purple shucks now I want to clear that history again I just use the keyboard shortcut by the way it was shipped come on our and that's only for Firefox and only for Mac ok so we've got the hover state which is why you're hovering over the link and we've got the active state which is why you're clicking down on it and then we also have the visited state which is after you visited the link what color do you want that to be and let's change the color to green or well let's make it orange okay so now our text or our link can have four different colors depending on what state it is in and by default oops okay I've been to this link before that's why it says that's why it's orange so it's got a history clear recent history and now all of a sudden the whole window showed up so clear come back here alright so a link that I've never visited before is gonna be blue right and then as I hover over that it's gonna change to red because we said look we want our text to be read when we're hovering over it then as I click down on it I left that color as red let's change that to green refresh this again alright so as I click down on this link now it should turn green and when I let go and now I visited Google now I've been there and my browser knows that I've been to Google before if I come back now the tip color of the text is orange so that's just kind of like a nice hint to tell people hey you might have visited this this link before so that's where we use pseudo-classes pretty much every single time we build a site will always style these four elements of a link but like I said you can also use the hover on a normal paragraph or a normal block or something like that and there is a full list of pseudo classes available on w3schools I find that they're you know pretty good if you want lists of things so we also have stuff like first child and first off type and enth child so I think and child I'll show you guys in this video and to do that I'm going to just break over to a new line over there and let's think of a new elements to add I think I'm gonna add a paragraph and I'm gonna say this is paragraph one and I'll just duplicate this line a few times and we'll say two three four and five and what I want to show you guys here is the end child styling so it's probably best if I remove this paragraph for now otherwise it could mess up our styling a little bit all right so we've got paragraph 1 2 3 4 & 5 and I want to select the nth child so in previous tutorials you know if whenever we want to style a paragraph you select the paragraph selector but I want to select end child and what this will allow me to do is style a specific child or paragraph child so let's say in child - and that should select our second paragraph and I'm gonna change the color of that - let's think of a color we haven't used yet gray right save this come back here and hit refresh and mmm paragraph second child ray and child that should have changed the second one let's go to n ok so what 2n does or the letter n is basically I say repeat this for the enth child so if we're starting with the first paragraph over here then every second paragraph after that we also want to be grace we can make this cool pattern where we have one blue I mean one gray one black one gray on black on gray and you can use n style to select just the specific elements which is when you don't use the end so let me just add in a higher number here like five come back in and hit refresh and you can see that now this one is gray so because the first one went and now this one with obviously I'm selecting one lower paragraph every time and I think if I troubleshoot this that link is for some reason being classed as a paragraph or being treated as a paragraph somehow that's interesting so let me just let me just comment this out and come back here and hit refresh and there we go now it's selecting the fifth element and I I'm not quite sure why it did that but hey I figured out what the problem was and I worked around work my way around it and that's what you guys should always do right so a better use case for this would actually be if we wrapped all of these in a parent because we are talking about children here right we're not talking about parents so the child right now we're going we're working off of the body so let's add a parent to this I'm going to create a div tag will end that off I'm just going to take all of these paragraphs place them in here indent them so they're all even and I'm gonna remove the comment on this because that way it can throw us off if it if if we're gonna be making a mistake but I'm gonna give this a class of child example and yeah what I'm gonna do now is take this clause copy that and select by class over here so what we're doing is we're combining some of what we learned in the previous tutorial with this tutorial so any paragraph that is within child example or within this div that has that class we want to select the nth child of that and turn it gray so in this case we're selecting the fifth child so come back here and hit refresh child number five should not be great right and I can change this to child number two come back here and hit refresh and now child number two should be gray and like I said you can also add in your equations here by adding the letter N and what the hell do is repeated so every 2 n child would be every even child every second child so now number two and number four both turned gray right but you can also play around with this a little bit because there are lots of different equations you can put in here so 2 n plus 1 basically means every second child beginning at the first element and what that'll do is turn all odd numbers gray so let's hit refresh and you can see every second child this one skip one yeah so paragraph one skip number two paragraph three every second child has turned gray but we started at the first element and that's what that that plus one means can also go every second child beginning at the second element and what that'll do is turn all even paragraphs gray so all of the even numbers and you can also play around with us a lot more so you can do every fourth child beginning at element two as well and if I added more paragraphs paragraph number six should be great so let's add or shift come on D yeah okay let's add a sixth paragraph in here and now that one should be great so there's a bunch of different equations you can put in here if you understand your maths you can play around with this a little bit but that is how to style patterns of elements if you want to use the nth child and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and
