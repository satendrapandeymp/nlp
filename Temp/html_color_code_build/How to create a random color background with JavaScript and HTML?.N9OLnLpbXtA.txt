hello guys today I am going to show how to create a random color background with JavaScript events TMO so one is math dot random what math dot random does is generates the value from 0 to 1 studies something like 0.5 0.5 and extra and the second second function we are going to use is Madrid round for example forty five point three four is rounded to 45 and twelve point seven rounder to so Dean and let's get started I am going to create a new HTML file so I have created your basic government's for the HTML so we are going to add our script tag and CELTA so inside the script tag and I will be adding my JavaScript code and inside the style tag I will be adding my CSS code so that I'll be adding ID to body Oh [Music] and these lines are not mandatory so you can keep this if if there is a content inside the body so I am going to give the initial background so that interrupts good white have to do let's see and or this is the initial one and we are disk [Music] so what this setinterval dust is rigorously function with a given interval this is the interval this thousand means that once again so once again is equal to thousand values which is given here if you want to chain four dents again this is given as ten thousand so I will be keeping as a thousand so that it looks good EXO for the RGV if you search in Google for CSS this is 255 C maximum values so I am multiplying the random value which we get with 255 so I'm going to round that with math dot round function Oh for the others and this is the same so we can used the same and while teaching [Music] okay come on let this one and [Music] so what this talking about get element by ID does is just controls this element so is the ID which gave each here random guy alone is he one so it's comment on both sides so you see that the color is changing for every second so I'm gonna add a neat transaction for this of bagging changing so it's a doubt I would recommend the value of transition job should be equal to or the value which is given in set intervals so SC e that so that's a pretty uniform than the old one so I can subscribe to my channel for more videos and thank you
