hi this is Jason at Filene's media I'd like to welcome you to our blog that links media blog spot.com and also to our second tutorial which is creating your first three column div layout as you can see we're using the source files from our last tutorial and to get us started out here inside of our body container where we created our left and right column I'm going to go under our left column and create a center column and then I'm also going to go inside of my center column and create yet another div and I'm going to call it center column underscore enter and I'm going to save that and you're probably asking yourself why is he creating a center column underscore enter but I'll explain that inside of the CSS as you can see I've already created my containers here I'm and the first thing we're going to have to do if we go and look at our layout which is the one we created in the last tutorial you'll see that the left column and right column are taking up pretty much the whole body of the page so we're going to need to change the width on those columns and we're going to change them to 260 pixels and I'm also going to go into my center column and give it a width 260 pixels and I have no need to give that one a high ched and going to our center column underscore enter also make its width two hundred sixty pixels give it a height of 400 pixels and we're going to give this one a background color and we'll make this one olive and also your center column is going to need to be floated left so if we save that oops we've got to change the right column width - all right so we save that and go over to our layout and refresh the screen okay you see we got our three columns now this is why I have a center column enter I use nothing but padding I know and the more current versions of browsers margin is becoming a lot more consistent but just to be on the safe side I've pretty much cut margin out of my CSS Styles totally so by using the container I can set a padding left on the center column and I'll make it 10 pixels and if I save that and go back and refresh you can see my center column is now evenly placed between my left and right column and that is pretty much all there is to creating a three column div layout I hope you come back and visit for our next tutorial which will be creating a CSS rollover menu using unordered lists and we'll do a horizontal and a vertical style menu you
