what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your let's see let's count another your fifth xhtml tutorial now in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be going over a couple more tags and also something called comments so you know just want to give you guys an introduction because things are going to get pretty intense and I don't want to startle you guys so anyways let's go ahead and let's cover our first new tag and that's a horizontal rule you remember when I said on the last Oriole that there are pretty much two types of tags opening and closing tags which are pretty much normal and you have these special tags right here so you pretty much have double tags and single tags well a horizontal rule is pretty much a line that goes across your website so if you're saying Bucky why the F what I want a big a line across my website well it's actually more of like a separator that's probably a better term so whenever you have like a new topic or you want to make a distinct new section of your website you add something called a horizontal rule and why is it called a rule well I think it has something to do with like if you ever got a notebook and it's like college rule or wider rule I don't know I think it's something weird and French and you know because those guys are weird over there by the way did you ever hear a French person or ever see them try to spell shop SH oppe how many peas do you need in it dude easy French Canadian people anyways enough of me bashing on French I love you guys and your fries so let's go ahead and make a horizontal rule so here's our website right now best website ever this is my paragraph but let's say under this is my paragraph then I want a line right here so people knew that it was a new section I shouldn't say new twice two different spellings same sound so people would know that it's a brand new section and Bucky that's a little better so anyways let's go ahead and add this HR and after it make your forwards less because remember with single tags you need a forward slash after the little key key name or whatever the text so let's go ahead and save this and see what that does to our webpage let's go ahead and refresh this and check it out we now have a line across the total width of our website so now it might be a little more clear to someone visiting site that says all right this is one section and this is another section by the way if you're ever like looking on ebay or amazon calm that have like one item a picture and low description then they have a horizontal rule have another item so you know in the future if you guys want to make an auction website then uh you know keep in mind horizontal rule that's a nice little tip for you that's what I'm here to a you know give you guys tips oh yeah you're welcome so anyways aside from the horizontal rule let's go ahead and spruce up this text a little more say this is the second paragraph and now I'm done with these stories let's learn how to bold and italicize text now usually with all your styling and all the way you layout things on your website you want to use CSS which we didn't cover yet but for now I'm going to show you guys how to style text using you know basic arm bolding and italicize so anytime you want to bold either a word or an entire paragraph you surround it with it with a tag strong so strong let's go ahead and bold the word second and let's just go ahead and copy this because I'm lazy and control-v right there so now the word second is going to be bolded so let's scroll over and let's go ahead and italicize I'm done with this so italicize is a little bit different let's go ahead and make a tag and it's actually e M and now whenever you want to end the block of code that you want to tell sighs let's go ahead and write end eeehm so now it's going to start right here with I'm and it's going to italicize everything until it gets to this ending tag e/m so let's go ahead and by the way II M stands for emphasis and that means italicize to your browser so let's go ahead and save this and look at our new bolded and italicized text now you can see that this is the second which is bolded or strong paragraph and now I'm done with this I guess that's what how you would read it and now I'm done with this tutorial I don't know however you read italicized stuff so anyways basically don't mind me that's how you are bold and italicize text so there's one other thing that I told you guys that are covering this story but I can already see that we're getting all clustered up so let's go ahead and delete everything inside your body again there we go now let's save it and now let's start with a blank body just like that so what I want to teach you guys is how to add a comment in your website so let's go ahead and make some text hi my name is Bucky and I am very lucky hmm and next you know maybe we can make this a paragraph and maybe we can end it right here and let's just go ahead and I you know italicize something pretty dumb website we have going on but hey just an example so hi my name is Bucky paragraph I am very lucky this is an awesome website going to post that get in Google search results but anyways what I wanted to teach you guys and why I had to make this dumb website is I want to teach you guys about comments now comments are little notes that you post to yourself that the browser totally ignores so they don't show up to the website they don't show up on the website they don't show up you know where anyone can see them they're just dumb little comments that you post yourself so for example if I was coding this website and I wanted to leave a comment to myself that saying you know do I want to change this text right now well I don't know but I want to leave like a post a note telling me that maybe I'll come back to it maybe I won't well what you want to do is you want to leave yourself a comment but you can't just type like this you can't just type you know change this paragraph under here or under me because you know whenever you do it's going to show up on the screen right here so what you need to do is your need to surround this and comment on the note there called comment tags but special comment symbols so in order to that press the less than sign explanation point - - and now everything after this is going to be a comment until you get to - - greater sign so this comment is going to be seen by you but it's going to be ignored by the browser whenever it comes across it so let's go ahead and save this and check it out see this text change this paragraph under me whenever you refresh it the browser just ignores it right there so that is how you can you know kind of leave notes to yourself throughout your document you know maybe if you want to change something or maybe you know just want to put the date when you worked on it you know if we were you know 10 years in future that would be the day but anyways a comment is basically opposed to note that you can see but no one that's looking at your website in the browser is basically just going to ignore so um you might see me leave comments later on with a short website like this you don't really need it but when you're working on something really long or working on something as a team they're really useful so anyways that's what comments are that's how you bowled in emphasized text and that's what horizontal rules do so in the next tutorial we're going to be going over something sweet we're going to be going over how to make links pretty sweet links the Google links to other web pages and that's going to take a couple tutorials so that's what you guys have to look forward to but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and if
