okay we are in the second part of the second chapter we are learning about the Lang attribute Lang attribute as you can easily make out it is the language attribute of your website you can easily define language for your website as many languages as you want and it's and your website will be a multilingual language and it is possible because you simply have to make copies of your website and then declare the language as another language as as for example English is the default language any browser would read English by default if language is not defined English would be a default language in the other the copy of this website you can define a language with its code I'm gonna explain that how to do that so why are we doing lang lang is something that is increasingly important in your website because there are with the website with your internet becoming more more you know popular and widespread with broadband connections and all kind of connectivity we have with each other with the world with businesses more and more people are logging into the internet and trying to check out information so we have a global marketplace here with diverse people who need to access information so if you want your website to reach a wider audience you need to have we need to have a knowledge of how to add language in your website how to add multiple languages on your website so Stephanie is also thinking the same thing she wants she has a market for French and English people english-speaking people English is basically international as we know so she has market for French people as well so she needs what she needs to do as she says that I need to set the language of the website to English and French so we're gonna have David in this video set the language for the website in English and French and I'm going to show you how to do that but before I show it to you let me show you example here this is care for okay care for as you can see from this picture it's a grocery store okay it's a hyper market and it's a very popular chain of grocery stores you may have heard of it it stems from and the it originates from France and if you took a look at their website okay I have this website here the France website if you take a look at the website everything here is in French okay this is the French language alright and if you look at the Carrefour UAE website there is a branch here in Carrefour this is a branch for France different provinces and different cities in France have this careful and this is the date here in French okay and this is the UAE website and notice the Arabic careful written here but I think that's part yes that's the part of the logo and this lang this website is multi-language multilingual this is English and Arabic at the same time if you hit Arabic it will show you the Arabic translation of the English page okay the logo comes with Arabic and freeing glish which tells us that this you know business is for the Arab locality here the logo is just care for it just says care for nothing else because care for is a French word okay so we have all kinds of marketing going on here we have pictures here we have all of these basic information it's in English and if it is not possible to translate something in English it displays in English which is fine so if you want something like this in your website have a website with two languages let's go back to English that's how easy it is just switch to English if you want something in English like this you have to learn how to use the lang tag okay let me show you another thing that's really cool here okay for example you can type this on your browser so WWF o dot F R that's French okay this is how you know that it's a French website the Google directories they need to know which websites they're accessing for which location for example if you do a Google search from France you will see all French websites okay the big dub be on the top of your list all right depending on your searching habits but that's how Google would display results based on your locality ok simply right click here ok you see back reload save as print translate to English view page source control you click on that please ok what does this do for me oh my gosh look at this this is lines and lines of code some of it you may not recognize some of it I can see that he can make out especially the HTML tags okay this is actually here you have the xref tag we talked about it ok alright and you can do this with many many websites just go by click and go view source ok you cannot make changes here what I'm trying to show you is the lang tag okay just hit this button here and click on find ok the options button the options menu on your browser click on find and look for LAN LAN Jie ok what happens when you look for lang ok I'm going to start from the beginning then we go all the way at the top and it's going to tell me that this is the lang tag here there are several areas where the Lang tag is defined land tag is defined within the HTML tag ok you always want to use the a language attribute in your HTML tag to declare the default language of the text of the page when the page contains content in another language add a language attribute to an element surrounding that content it's very easy I will explain what I just said but right now so fight suffice it to say that do not lease and the language tag anywhere else it has to go in the HTML tag you cannot add the HTML so you cannot add the language tag in the body element because that would mean that you know the title would still remain in the default language while the body would be in some other language which is not professional you know you need to do things with good for practicing habits so you have to define your language tag in the HTML tag let's look at the car you a the you a careful view source right click please and view page source and check this out it says default language is equal to e and I'm gonna explain that in a second just hang in there believe me it's not as complicated as it sounds I'm gonna look for in the Lang tag again okay I want it right at the top okay the first place where it happens okay the first page the first area where it happens it's language is Apple to English okay action is equal to default okay we have the classes objects JavaScript XML a lot of code going on here because you know guys what I'm trying to explain is HTML is very compatible with other languages as well so you will find ActionScript JavaScript ASP you would find many languages integrated in this website to boost the functionality because their limitations within the HTML language other languages you you add coding the other languages the browser is able to read it all because of classes I'm gonna explain classes at the end of this chapter okay hang in there you not missing anything we're gonna cover it later classes this is all the game of classes going on here so we have the language stack again the language tag is defined within the HTML tag and it says language is equal to English and country is equal to UAE okay and again we have language English II and and we have this place real language is equal to Arabic okay AR now what are these ar e and F R what is this where is this coming from okay let me give you some here we have the this is the HTML language codes okay just like you have : codes like if you want to call Canada USA or any other country any international call you begin the call to the code right it's a standard anywhere in the world everybody uses the same code similarly the International Organization for Standardization they put up this quote list here okay and they created this list and as you can see there are many many and the list keeps growing like crazy as like like you know just like I said that this is a global market now so more and more people are logging into the internet and they want to have access to information which is in their native language so more and more people just to have you know a global reach more and more businesses in order to have more market share they are trying to have languages Multi multilingual website land websites so you have the language for example Africans it's AF Arabic is AR okay and the many languages which I don't even recognize but I can appreciate this because this is a lot of work Chinese is here Z H okay and Dutch we have English right here our favorite now English is the default if land attribute is not defined in the page for example take a look at those guys my first no faith if it is not defined it's not defined here remember we just typed the HTML tag the head tag the title tag and the body tag and we closed all of them and we put information for the heading and the paragraph there is no place where we added the language style which is fine and why because the English is the default language and if you look at the web page that we created the green event manager is the language is English okay so what I'm trying to explain here is this is how different languages are defined okay you need to create a special button the button deals with the leads to the website again and leads to the same website and the website is translated based on the declaration it has okay another cool thing about Google is that if the language is not defined for you for example I try to look at any language here okay when I first uploaded this page when I first loaded this page I had a message here from Google that yes would you like to translate this page if I do translate it would translate everything in English this page is being translated notice how everything is in English okay but some of the code it's like you know it's all overlapping with each other it's not as neat some of the things still didn't translate okay why because these were explicitly they went in the menu item or the link item or the language or the image itself is a name in French so like this one like this one okay I wish I could pronounce French but I'm sorry you can't so what I'm trying to say is this was Stephanie's request she wants the language of the website in French okay and if I try to refresh it it will go back to its original language do you would you like to translate the page no let's look at the options here you could page language into French and then translate the page for example what if I try Arabic okay translate everything becomes it's false let it in Arabic but the thing is guys let me tell you very honestly even if they translate in Arabic what happens is this is still not the way people in you know different localities speak in Arabic that's the biggest drawback you might be you might be thinking why do I have to study language type anyway on the Google Google has a feature that would be that will help me translate why would I need it anyway let me tell you something Google is not you know as as professional or as known professional wrong word it is not as linguistically correct as a human being okay so you need to define the language and their class is set for language for example you have Arabic for UAE you have different Arabic for Saudi Arabia can you believe that it's a different way of reading so if you want Arabic for this local market this won't work nobody would like to read something like this so the differences in dialects they make a world of difference so even though Google will translate it for you you can make do without without with their actual translation within the website within the markup but let me tell you it's not a feasible solution the best solution is to do it yourself okay so what I need to do is so if you look at this page my first heading and my first paragraph this is apparently in English okay supposing I want to change the language of this website to French all I need to do is go back to my notepad and within the HTML tag type length okay st ml lang is equal to Fr that's it this is it okay and I want to save this page as my first page Fr okay that's French okay and then I want to also save it as HTML have already done that for you so just save it I'm going to save it again yes okay and I'm going to go back here and double click here so that it appears okay now there is nothing to be stressed about my first heading and my first paragraph is still in English why because you have typed in English okay if space was full of forms and other you know customer input areas or any other French language that we've marquees and everything anything that you generate in French would come up in French okay it would recognize the grammar it would recognize the the alphabet and the punctuation everything it but the website would recognize that for you okay because you declared the language in French the reason why we know this is in French language is because Google's detected that this is not my normal language it says would you like to translate this page and if you translate it nothing would happen it would still remain my first heading because we haven't done anything in French here okay one great way of doing this is for example just take this copy ctrl C let's write this entrench just go to Google Translate and write my first page and we translate it into something like this I'm gonna try to pronounce this I am NOT doing what is spoil the language okay it's a beautiful language so we have this translation here go back to your notepad and change it here right here okay and control V okay and then my first paragraph you need to change that as well I'm going to do ctrl X that's basically how you create multilingual websites you whatever you have written down for example the menu items and everything menu on their image titles the page title the headings all of those who have to change yourself you have to explicitly change according to the local dialect remember I said that a few minutes ago the local dialect you have to write according to that but by declaring here HTML language is equal to French what you're doing is you're letting the browser know be prepared this is going to be a French language people reading are French people they're going to be typing French words so you have to be able to read the information and capture information or there any forms for submission do not mess it up just send it to me the way it is okay I'm going to control it's the paragraph and go back to my Google Translate control we'd remember this is not a very good way of translating okay you have to have a professional local translator for this but if you speak the language there's nothing better than that you don't need a translator okay if your second language is French awesome you can do it yourself mon premier better cats okay that's what it says I'm sure a spalted but never mind we'll all learning here and I'm going to control V here okay and I'm gonna save save as save it's and then I also want to save it as the web page all files okay just click here say yes and I want to go back here and double click here alright this is in French okay now notice I did not get in any for example I got something here remember but okay it won't work because yeah I just changed it okay I did not get a message from Google you want me to translate I did not get that message from Google because this is a French page and Google knows that this is what's expected okay and this is French so all I need to do is my dear students what do you need to do just have two pages a copy of this page or whatever you write here whatever whatever code you create here you can do copy the file you're going to make a mirror image of the file and then go at the top of the court in Smith in the HTML define the language as French okay notice what happens when I try to take this away okay I'm going to save it as my first page okay en you could write save and again I'm now can you change this again I'm going to save it as I'm going to save it as en dot html' okay because I don't want to lose the French version of the file save okay what happens when I go back here and I want to double click on the English page okay it will show whatever have typed without any issues okay so what I need to do is just go back and change these back to English my first paragraph because this is the English first paragraph and then I have my first heading if there is really not much to the language tag except for adding something here any code that you want from the ISO chart that I showed is added here HTML Spaceland is equal to inverted commas open the language itself inverted commas closed that's it and I'm going to save it as English yes and I also want to save it as my HTML page I'm just going to click there oh there you go save yes and let's go back and open it ok double click and I'm back to my English language again so my students this was all about the language tag the thing is we need to cover more we need to add more content for this to be able to more to be more meaningful to you so just hang in there you just learned about the language attribute you're going to go next and up next we're going to do the next attribute which is the xref attribute you're going to cover this and our learning a check
