in the last video we added an element for the first time and when we clicked on this button we got this paragraph right here in this video we're going to add another element what we want to do is add a heading for our new section here because this is in fact a new battle so we want to add a heading and we want the heading to appear before our paragraph so let's flip to our code and here is the code of course we created from the last video now remember I told you that JavaScript will add the element after the last element it finds within that diff so obviously we need to create our heading code before we create the paragraph element because we want the heading to come first of course so since we're adding some more code here let's actually create some comments so we'll say this creates a paragraph good and then we'll just copy and paste this and we'll create an area here for our heading that we're about to create and we'll say this creates a heading good and of course we can use the same code like I said that we created in the last video so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this and let's use a different variable name we'll call this element H for heading and we'll put an h2 here and so this will create our h2 heading above our paragraph we can go ahead and use this again and of course this will hold our div now since we're creating this up here we no longer need this code down here because we can attach as many different elements to this main object once we've created it we don't need to create this again because that just adds extra overhead so let's go ahead and get rid of this line now good so now that we have our h2 heading element created we of course need to append the child to the div and we can just go ahead and copy and paste this and of course now we're going to be attaching a new object and of course that is element H and then of course we need to create our text node for our heading and we're going to call that the battle of salamis much shorter than what we had in the last video in terms of text and actually let's add some quotes here well okay let's just move this there we go and then you will remember once we've created a text note we actually have to attach the text node and we need to attach that of course to the heading node that we created up here so let's just go ahead and copy and paste this and of course this will be element H and you know what we're going to give this text another variable name too so let's call that text H and text H good and you know what we need a T here for thee that wouldn't work too well okay so let's save everything up and let's go run our web page in chrome and let's see if this works and if we hit our button out there you can see now we have a complete section the battle of salamis so now we have a full section so let's close this out now you might be wondering if we can add an element we should be able to remove an element and that's what we're going to do in the next video see you guys in
