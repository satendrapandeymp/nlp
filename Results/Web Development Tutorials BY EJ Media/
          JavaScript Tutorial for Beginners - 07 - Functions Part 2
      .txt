okay we are continuing on from the last video where we were talking about functions in this video we're going to expand upon functions and we're going to talk about the opening and closing parentheses now as I said in the last video this is where we pass data or information into our function and then we can do whatever we want with that data we can multiply it we can subtract it we can divide it anything is open game and so let's actually change our function name because we're going to add some data in this function so let's change this to add something so it's a little bit more relevant and then we're going to create the parameters that we're going to use now these are called parameters but they're actually variables because they will actually hold the data that gets used by our function the only difference is we don't use the VAR keyword we can actually just write out the name of a variable I like to think of it more as a placeholder it's kind of a temporary placeholder where it just holds the data that gets passed into our function and then as I said our statements will work against whatever data the variables in this parenthesis are holding so we're going to do multiple parameters here now you can do one parameter you can do two parameters you can do as many parameters as you want you just have to put a comma between each parameter or variable so let's call our first variable num because it is going to be a number and we will call the second variable STR because that is going to hold a string and as I said you could name this anything you want it doesn't matter you could have this a hundred characters if you wanted it does not matter but I like to make the variable name somewhat relevant to whatever data or information it is holding well now we'll pass in data when we call our function down here but for now let's go ahead and put some statements into our function let's get rid of this comment and then what we're going to do is create a variable inside our function and we're just going to simply call that add and then we're going to say that is equal to num plus STR and then of course a semicolon so basically this variable will add up these two variables in our parentheses and whatever data is stored in them and then what we're going to do is we're going to alert and we're just going to alert on the variable name and that of course is at so we just put ad in there and now we need to actually call our function down here and so again this is where we pass in data to our function so we need to obviously change the function to add something because this is the function we're calling and let's first pass in a number because that's the first variable that we have up here for a number and let's pass in 455 and then we need a comma and let's pass in a string now and we'll pass in the string programs too right now I have a space here because if we don't put this space here the output would put the word programs right next to 45 and we want this to read more like a sentence so that's why I put the space here so again this number is going to equate to this variable and the variable STR is going to hold this string for us and then we have a variable inside ER function that's going to add our two variables and then we're going to of course alert on that variable which of course we'll see when we open up our browser so let's go ahead and save this and let's flip over to our web page that references our JavaScript file and let's run this in chrome and there you can see we get our sentence 455 programs too right and we'll hit OK to that now I want to point out that this example has everything coming in we are sending data into our function but we can also return values from our function as well and we'll talk about that in the next video see you guys
