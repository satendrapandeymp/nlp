yo people I'm Sean from the net ninja and this is lesson 6 of HTML basics headings and text so in the last lesson we kind of went into more detail about the head and how we put everything in there for the browser to give it more information about the web page and then we went through the body briefly and we just said that this is everything else that you want the user to see on the browser so now what we're going to do is dive back into the body tag and play around with text a little bit see how we can format it in slightly different ways and show it to the user in different ways so I'll jump back over to brackets right so here I am back in brackets and this is pretty much where we left it last time I have changed the h1 tag it announces welcome to my smelly fish shop because this is what we're selling right and then the P tag says we sell the smelly fish on the planet apart from that everything else is the same so what we'll do first these will demonstrate some different H tags now I mentioned earlier these range all the way from H 1 to H 5 it could be more to be honest I've never needed to use anything beyond H 5 you and a h3 h4 and finally a h5 and the way this works is as follows the h1 is the most important heading text so if you have a site title at the top of your webpage you'd use a h1 a subtitle for that maybe four different sections on your web page you'd use a h2 and so forth and right down at the bottom of the stack is Haiti five one in just a little bit of attention but it doesn't get much so that's the least important tag so let's save this out and have a look in the browser and remember we can just right-click in the left hand side on the file showing Explorer and double click on file and there we go it looks awfully like a sight chart a psych test chart so this was our original text and these are all the new hate tags and we can see that the h1 is the most important h2 second and so forth and this H oh we've not changed the the text of that but it should say this is a h5 tag and that is the smallest of all of them it's even smaller than the P tag now that's how unimportant this h5 tag is so there are heading tags now what can we do with normal text well I'll jump back into brackets so here we are back in brackets and to demonstrate what we can do with normal text I'm going to copy this P tag and generally speaking most times that you do text you're going to put the text if it's just generic text within a P tag you can pop text outside of a P tag however then it becomes a little harder for you to grab hold of that text in the CSS file and style it to your liking I would always recommend putting text within some kind of tag generally a p1 okay so what we're going to do is keep the top P tag exactly the same so we can compare the rest to that and we're going to embed different tags within the P tags if you remember I said you can Nest attacks within tax that's what we could we're going to do here so I'm going to nest some different tags within the rest of the P tags so this first one will do a small tag copy that and paste it there and we've just made the word fish here small so hopefully when we view this in a browser that's going to turn the fish word pretty small the next one up will do mark and essentially what the mark tag does is highlight the text it's exactly the same as if you were studying for an exam and you had a highlighter and your highlights in some text in a term on a page this has the same effect the third one will do will be the exact and the sub tag stands for subscript so that's going to make the text a little bit smaller and push it down below the normal text line the next one we'll do is a soap and by the way I mentioned that brackets has this thing called code code hinting you've noticed out just press the S key i've not tapped a full tag name and it's come up with a lot of different options for me and i can just choose the sup tag from here so it's good if you forget which tag you want to use or if you forget the name of the tag and finally what we're gonna do to demonstrate pre formatted text you stick the whole sentence within a pre tag okay so we're gonna save that and actually i'll do one more thing just to demonstrate this soap set tag i'm gonna do ten sort for because what's up stands for is superscript and that's most efficient when you're doing things like 10 to the power of four as you've seen some kind of mathematical equation so we've got our normal p tag then the small one then the mark then the subscript superscript and then the pre formatted tag so i'm going to save this out and then we'll open this up back in a browser and we can see we've got our first P tag here nothing's happened to that the second P tag here if you look closely you can see that the word fish is ever so slightly smaller we've got the third one which was the mark time very like very much like highlighting effect the fourth one which is a subscript has brought the text down below the line and the fifth one which is a superscript has brought the text above the line very much like the mathematical equations where you see 10 to the power 4 the last one but it was a pre tag which stands for pre formatted text and that is kind of not give the text any browser styles okay and that's because everything that we do in the pre tag the browser just takes that as is and displays it in the browser to demonstrate that a little bit more I'm going to jump back into brackets and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a break here after smelliest so I press the Enter key and it's brought fish on the planet to the next line I'm gonna do it exactly the same on the first P tag where there's no tags inside just to demonstrate the difference so the P tag has no pre formatted text in it and the last P tag here has a bit of pre formatted text in it where we've gone into a new line and that change should show in the browser so I'll open it up one last time and we can see that here the last one we did it's brought the second part of the sentence on to the next line because I hit enter and I brought it that way on the text editor the top one has had no effect whatsoever so that's what a preformed a pre pre tag does you can pre format the text within the text editor alright so what we've done now is we've got a few different heading tags and a few different ways of formatting text within P tags so I think now we're well equipped to go into the next lesson and start fleshing out the website a little bit more so I'll see you guys then
