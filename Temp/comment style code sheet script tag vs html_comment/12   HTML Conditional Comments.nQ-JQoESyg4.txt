welcome back guys this is told tutorial in HTML in this tutorial I'm going to show about it commands in HTML let me start with a simple comment a comment bag which is using HTML as an exclamatory mark followed by double dash place whatever you want like this like comment and close this comment by using double dash at the hand of the tag and let me had a better of tag over this displace some text oh we oh over you let me close this paragraph element and let's save this and let me check in the browser this displays some text to over here so that browser a browser completely ignores the command element which is placed in here document so this elements it can be read in the browser it only displays the paragraph tag over your for let me take some text over you see paste paste paste let me save this and check it you this displays some text over here we have four paragraphs right here so the fifth paragraph I am going to place this this is the text without comment close this element and let me place that comment for this for this chunk of HTML elements the tag which is used to for this is sara x limit remark and yet to dash and I closing dead and i'm going to close it as let me take this sorry let me take this line and save this so so this is the method oh we are making a chunk of HTML into your command let me check it in the browser this is the text without comment only the p element over here without the comment is displayed by the browser all this p element are ignored by the browser there is something another method in command called condition comments this condition commands all the let me explain something about browser in all the process we can't record assume that all the things works exactly what we have planned in all the process in some browser there is a limitations for the tags so the general example is internet explorer internet explorer won't support most of the html5 elements in strozier so form that users we are going to place a conditional command and in between the conditional government replace some HTML elements this HTML elements will be displayed only for the internet browser user and all other all other browsers like mozilla chrome and chromium will ignore those those HTML elements which is placed in between the conditional comments and it won Li reads the HTML element which is outside of the conditional elements so our conditional comments and let me show how it works the tag which is used for conditional the like conditional command is same as the comment inner HTML just place this on the square bracket inside the square bracket I am going to use a keyword if if the browser is lesser than el de or GD for greater than I am going to use LTE lesser than internet explorer 8 so i am going to place an element this x1 lee support in internet explorer explorer ii explorer earlier version of ate and ate earlier and let me close this command sorry this element p and and for the closing we are going to use the same ! and inside the square bracket end if and place this to dash for you so the element in a conditional command in a conditional connect only works if the browser is in internet explorer 8 or or lesser than eight that is five four five six seven eight if the browser is different from the internet explorer eight or earlier say for example mozilla chrome whatever maybe this element is completely ignored and only the element here will be displayed so i'm using here let me save this i am using a mozilla firefox here so this element won't be appear in my browser let me check this yes the this is a text without comment let me play something without without conditional command command is already there save this and let it sit near yeah this is a text without conditional command so this is the thing how the browser understands the conditional comments and the commands in a web document so in the next tutorial I am going to teach you about some advanced HTML file takes formatting elements don't forget to subscribe keep watching me see you then
