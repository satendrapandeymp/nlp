hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss floating images how do we float image to the left or to the right of the content or how do we wrap content around an image you can see here I have an image my pic dot jpg and also I have a notepad file which contains an intro text with respect to the image so let's get started I go to start I type here notepad hit enter then I say opening HTML tag closing HTML tag opening head tag closing head tag opening body tag closing body tag then we say in the head section opening title tag there I say floating image demo closing title and then I say file save as i say floating image demo dot HTML both sides i put double quotations and save the file at desktop I click on save button minimize this you can see that the file got created I right click on it open with the Firefox you can see floating image demo dot HTML page got opened and floating image demo is set as a title in between the body section I am going to create one paragraph closing paragraph and inside the paragraph I paste some intro content I minimize minimize it I right click on intro text notepad file open with the notepad I copy this content right click copy that and close paste it in this paragraph I say the file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the content is getting displayed then what I do I want a border around this paragraph so I have to use the style tag I am going to write opening style then I say type as a text or CSS double quotation close then I say closing style tag here I am going to tell paragraphs every paragraph in this page should have a border to pixels solid black color semicolon file save what happens now is paragraph is going to be surrounded by a border you can see that very good let's proceed further I want to make an image as a part of this paragraph content so inside the paragraph I am going to use IMG SRC and I give a value as my pic dot jpg that is available on the desktop close the tag now this image is going to become part of paragraph content and we know that image is an inline tag after the image itself the contents get start displaying so I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that here we have an image and the content to be displayed if I want I can increase the font size fo and the font - sighs I give 16 point maybe better so I say file save go browser and refresh I think that looks better now what I want is I want to float this content around the image if I minimize the browser window you can see that the content is not floating around the image but it is floating down so if you want to float the content should float from top right from here it should start and move down to do that we have to use the align attribute elig and align and I say here left if I say align left and say file save what happens we should understand when we say align left the image is taken out of the normal flow that means you can think like this image is taken out of the paragraph and it is made float towards left of its parent tag so this image left edge corner is going to be touching two paragraphs left edge but it will not be in the flow of paragraph so if i refresh and also you can see as we have removed the image out of the paragraph this content is going to move up so if i refresh you can see that the content moved up actually the paragraph height is only this much you can see the border of the paragraph very clearly and this content or this image is out of the normal flow it has been taken out the paragraph and place at the left edge of the paragraph if I reduce the size you can very carefully observe that the content is floating or wrapping around the image you can see that the behavior you can understand similarly what I do is I remove this align attribute and now we are in the normal flow file save go to browser and refresh you can see that image is a normal flow let assign a line righ T right now what happens now when we say a line right file save the image again taken out of the normal flow and it is moved towards right and image right edge is going to touch to the paragraphs right edge so if i refresh you can observe that the image right edge is touching to the paragraphs right edge let me prove that let me go back to notepad and say here IMG every image in this page should have a border of one pixel solid and that is to of gray color semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see now image has the border around it and you can see the right edge of the image is touching to the paragraphs right edge and also the content is going to float around it now you can see that the content is floating around the image when I change the size right so you should understand it very carefully if we want we can set the width of the paragraph itself WI D th width of maybe 500 pixels semicolon I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now the content is floating around and image is inside the paragraph itself and if you want you can give margin around the image margin of maybe 10 pixels if you give it looks really good file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a margin around the image and also if we want we can as align text te XD text - a li g and align justify if i say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that content is justified properly paragraph is now in justified mode I hope you guys are understanding how do we float the content to the left or to the right so okay if I say here left and save file save go to browser and refresh you can see image is floating to the left and content is wrapping around the image if we want later we can remove the border of the paragraph itself if we do not want file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now we have properly floated the content hope you guys have understood how we float the image to the left but if we have if I copy this content and paste it one more time down here I paste it down I paste it down and let's say I am not having this align left' I am not having this align left I say file save your browser and refresh so you can see we have one more image and paragraph one more image and paragraph content maybe I have 100 paragraphs like this okay I have hundred paragraphs like this maybe okay file save go to browser and refresh so like this now again I want to float contents to the left I want to float image to the left so how do I do that now I have to visit to every image right I have to go to every image and set here align a lig and align and say left double quotations file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the second paragraph image is floated left and content is wrapping around it properly but third paragraph image is on the same place then I have to go to third paragraph I have to go to image and say align equal to L EFT left double quotation file save go to browser and refresh so quite simple but instead of doing that if I have a hundred paragraphs I want to perform that operation in one single step I am going to remove this I am going to remove this also I am going to remove this also if I say file save go to browser and refresh now we have norm paragraphs which contain an image and content how do we float this image in one step so I have to write something in CSS style we have a solution to the problem by using the float property in CSS we have a float property which takes the value either left or right or none so I give here left and say semicolon if I have written float:left means we are telling that every image should be floated to left this float attribute or a property you can use on any HTML element at present we are telling float the image to left file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that every image is now floated to the left and contents are properly floating interesting right now if I say float right righ T right and say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the all images are floated to the right and content are wrapping properly around the images for example there is a situation there you come across like I want the first paragraph image should be floated on the left and the second paragraph image should be floated on the right how do we do that here comes identifying the elements uniquely now what I have to tell is every image tag should be floated to the right okay so here every image is floating towards right now I want the first paragraph so this is a first paragraph first image what we do is I can give id and say here id I am going to give is first P image that says it's a first paragraph image so here what I do select the image which has the ID first P image and tell to it as float to left semicolon so uniquely I am identifying this image and setting the float left on it file save go browser and refresh you can see only the first paragraphs image is floating left whereas all other paragraphs images are floating towards right similarly you can go to the third paragraph and identify it floated on the left so quite simple guys hope you guys are understanding how the float works with respect to images and paragraphs and how you can control the flow of content around the image so I suggest you to understand this clearly and practice is better because it is one of the real-time example used a lot in the next tutorial we discuss about how exactly the float attribute works in detail so for this tutorial this much is enough friends here for more benefits please subscribe and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing see you in the next tutorial thank you guys thank you very much
