hello guys welcome to my channel this is the twenty first tutorial in this course in this tutorial we'll be checking our definition lists in HTML definition lists allow you to have terms along with their descriptions as list items right so the HTML file that I have here has a doctype declaration on line number one and then between the opening and closing HTML tags I have the head in the body sections and the head section just has the title tags in the title of the document as you can see is of the web page is definition less and inside the body section on line number seven I have a heading between the opening and closing h1 tags and the heading is know these terms and then I have the tag DL or the element DL or line number a DL is a short form for definition list so you know it's easy to remember that way and then to have the terms you use the DT tags and to have their definitions you use the DD dykes so together these make one list item right so the opening Det tag and the closing DT tag on line number nine enclose Carbon you know the text carbon and on line number ten I have used the opening and closing VD tags to have the description of you know the text on line number nine right so carbon is an element so that's why I have written element there and similarly on line number twelve I have the opening and closing DD tags in between that I have the text but we never have the text golf and on line number thirteen I have opening and closing DD tags to include the description of golf and golf is a sport right so these descriptions can be as elaborate as you want them to be I just included single line you know sort of descriptions here and then on line number 15 I have again the opening and closing DD tags and another term which is blue and on line number 16 I have opening and closing DD tags to enclose a text colors because blue is a curve and then finally I have closed my definition list on line number 17 using the closing dl element 8 and then i've closed the body section and then finally the ending HTML tags they're on line number 19 so I save the file and this is how it looks for new viewed in Google Chrome and we have the heading on on the top and then we have these list items so carbon is an element and Golf is a sport and blue is a color that's it for this tutorial I will see you guys the next video in which will discuss more HTML and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and take care
