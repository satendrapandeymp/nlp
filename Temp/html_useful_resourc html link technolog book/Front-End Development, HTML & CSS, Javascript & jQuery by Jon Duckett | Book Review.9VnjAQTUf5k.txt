you ever have a hard day you just want to sit down after work and crack open a nice relaxing book about JavaScript and HTML me too these are older versions of these books I believe they came out with newly revised versions recently but I still think whatever version you have they cover a lot of the basic topics that will get you on your way to becoming a front-end developer very quickly so let's start with the HTML and CSS book this was the first one that I got in the set and although I think I already knew the majority of the stuff that was in here there was still some chapters that I needed to brush up on and I I think just the way that the book is laid out is really really great it covers things like you know text and lists and links all the really basic stuff so each chapter is broken up into really easy to read and really easy to understand kind of bite-sized chunks and and I think just a book is just really beautiful as well so even if you are getting your kind of educational resources elsewhere there's something to be said about a really beautifully laid out book about your kind of craft and I think everybody should have something like this on their shelf I also think that this book is really great because it offers a lot of really valid real world practical examples on how to start building websites right now obviously a little bit has changed since the original printing of this book but I think that if you started from start to beginning and you knew absolutely nothing about HTML and CSS you would literally be able to start making websites the minute you put this book down who is this book for I would say that the HTML and CSS book is for somebody who has never created a website in their life or for somebody who's created lots of websites but they just want to maybe brush up on a couple simple topics or the collector of beautiful books like me next I want to talk about the JavaScript and jQuery book now I think this is a good book but I think there's less that's applicable since the original press of this book I think jQuery is great it leaves a bit of a heavy footprint if you don't know what I'm talking about basically jQuery is a library of JavaScript that helps you to write less JavaScript but do more with that code and it also makes your code very cross browser compliant jQuery is really really great but I think it's probably better for you to learn in my opinion how to write JavaScript just pure vanilla JavaScript and then on top of there's a lot of really great front-end or JavaScript frameworks out there right now that would be really really great although jQuery still has a great place I think it's used in like something like 70% of websites that are online right now again it's written by the same author john Duquette and he does a really really good job of introducing you to the ABCs of programming as well as basic JavaScript functions what I like about this book is it's not just jQuery or just JavaScript it's both it gives you the tools to understand full JavaScript but then also simplify by writing jQuery as well I think that's something that's really interesting about this book is the case studies projects or examples that are actually given in this book are very very real-world very applicable and there's something about visually seeing what the code will do and the way that the book is laid out via colors and everything that just really helps those that don't have a very large programming background actually pick it up quicker than some of maybe the O'Reilly books or some of the other books that are out there on the topic so who is this book for I think this is like I said a great jumping-off point for somebody who has no idea what programming is and has never used JavaScript or jQuery before I also think it's a really really great companion book to the HTML and CSS book it's also I think a decent book for somebody who is an intermediate JavaScript and jQuery user like maybe you just know how to use job jQuery plugins but you don't know how to how to actually write JavaScript from scratch this would be good for you I don't think this would be as great of a book for somebody who's already very comfortable writing JavaScript I don't think it's actually worth it for you to purchase the just to have it on your shelf especially with the amount of progression that's been made since the original pressing of the book so probably not for you but I think if you read both of these books and you knew nothing about front-end development you could most likely finish the book make a couple concept projects and be ready to go out on a few interviews that's how much I really like these books so highly recommend them that's HTML and CSS design and build websites JavaScript and jQuery interactive front-end web development both by John Duckett and you can find the links to these books down in the description if you are interested at all in purchasing them thanks for taking the time to watch this video in this book review if you have any thoughts or comments on these books or any other books that you really love about design or front-end development please let me know in the comments I'm always looking for some good books to read and put on my nightstand if you like this video maybe consider hitting the like button also subscribing to the channel
