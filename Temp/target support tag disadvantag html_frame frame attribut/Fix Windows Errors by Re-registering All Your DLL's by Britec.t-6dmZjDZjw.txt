hi guys in this video I'll be showing you how to register the DLL files on a Windows operating system and this is going to be good for Windows XP Vista and Windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit operating systems you may be saying to yourself what do we need to re-register the DLL files we don't unless you've got issues with Windows itself or programs we may have had a malware on system that's called some errors or confliction with dll files or something like that you need to re-register them so this gets started and I'll show you how to back them up and we install them so first off we need to go to the start will do all bun type CMD inside there I'm going to right click on this and run it as administrator say yes for that and then we need to do here is go CD backslash and that will take us back to the C root directory and we're just going to change the directory into the windows directory like so let's web CLS just to clear the screen there so you can see what I'm doing and from there I need to put in our command that's going to backup our file now what that's going to do is it back up into our C root directory here okay when I finish this command so first off I need to do dir and then star and then dot DLL that's going to copy all the dll files /s and then B and then that little arrow I don't know that's cool we need to do you see colon backslash now and then re re - reg DLL thought back you can call that where you like really but I'm just going to call my rear edge thought they ll you can call it wherever you like when I run that it will put that file copy all the dll files and put it into the C root directory okay push enter there takes me a time and it's now done so if I go to SC root directory now you will see a file in there called re - reg DLL back copy that to the desktop really I could have located it onto the desktop but I normally work from the C root directory just for this er tutorial post it to the desktop okay so now we've got this on the desktop I'm going to edit it and show you the actual contents of it and you can see that's got all the dll files on this operating system there's a lot we're going to rearrange to all those so we need to make some tweaks to the sexual bat file before it will run because it won't run in this present state so what we need to do is go edit and then replace from there we're going to go to the find water and then put : C colon backslash like so and now replace it with and we're going to do Ridge svr which is to serve our 32 DXE and in space /s in code C colon backslash like so so that's what it should look like like that okay and then we're going to replace all of that and you'll see a change on here it's going to add it in front that this C colon windows so replace all and there you go let's replace that all in okay so now we have that in this to the next stage we need to delete some files inside this bat file okay the reason for that is because if we delete somebody's it will increase the speed of our air it does it and also it reduce all the amount of errors that will pop up on the screen so what we need to do here is go find a drink bring that right up the very top there make sure the cursors at the top and I want to actually do find when s X s and then they're all located inside this bat file and I'm going to make sure it's on down there and then click find next and you can see it will go down to the very first part there now everything below there is when s X so what I want to do is highlight this so that one there like so just extend this a bit so you can see what it's doing there and what I want to do is bring that all the way down to the bomb and I know it's right down the problems I've done it before so I need to push the shift key down and highlight all these okay there everything up to that first one I've done I'm going to push delete now on the key and you can see it's deleted all those there is another one that you need to do which is was on 64-bit version when I did not think this is a 32-bit version and it's called patch cache so what I want to do here is a type in patch cache with the actual dollar signs like so and I'm going to try it the down first I know it's not going to be on it I just want to show you just in case you have got 64-bit and then you just try to find it on the up and the down and it will search the whole of that file it's not there in this case so what I need to do here now is save file and save so now we have our file ready to run and what going to do here is I'll just run it on this machine here just to show you how it works so if I right-click on this now and run as administrator' it will read register all the dll files you need to say yes to that now if you get this box popping up don't worry about that you just close the program and it will carry on running now this can take up to 10 minutes to re-register all the dll files okay this is a hell of a lot on there so just let it run and occasionally you may see it freeze or pause and you'll have a blinking cursor on the screen just let it blink and you'll get your pop-up box popping up like so just leave those it is the cursor blinking sometimes that can stay like that for for a minute or two just leave it and then it will carry on when you get this box popping up just close that and carry on with the year registering I'll pause the screen is a stage okay so you'll see a cursor blinking there like so that hasn't finished it's still working so just let it blink your with stops at this part here so just let that run for a while then it will carry on when it's finished its job so do not close this off at this stage okay that's carrying on now and this box will just shut down when it's finished okay so that's when you know it's finished when the actual prop box will close okay so that's now complete and as you can see the box is now closed and it took the quite a few minutes probably about five minutes on this server jukebox but it will take a while and ten minutes as I said I hope you enjoy these videos my name is brian from bright echo dot uk' if you enjoy these videos please mem guys hit that subscribe button chase it also rate favorite for all my videos if you enjoy them okay and I'll be making more videos in the future like this if you've got any requests and send us a message and I'll do my best to make that video for you okay I'll see you on the forums if you need any help over there thanks a lot guys bye for now
