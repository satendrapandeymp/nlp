in this video we're going to talk about how to download and setup bootstrap now the first thing I want you to do is go to bootstraps homepage and I will provide the link for that in the description of this video and then what I want you to do is hit download and you're going to come to this download page right here and the version we're going to download is three point three point seven now there is a version for that is an alpha but really we only need to deal with three point three point seven that has everything that we need to get going in bootstrap now what you want to do is hit this download bootstrap button right here and then you're going to download the software so once that's done I want you to go over here and click on this basic template and you're going to open that up and then I want you to highlight all this HTML right here highlight all of that and then right click and copy now once you have that I want you to go to this website folder which you should have created sorry I didn't mention that earlier so I want you to create a website folder and then what I want you to do is go ahead and create a new text document and then we're going to go ahead and paste all of that HTML right into here now this is the default template this has everything that you basically need to start with a basic bootstrap web page and we'll talk about some of these things in a few minutes but first I want you to save as and then I want you to go ahead and select all files and we're going to call this index dot HTML and we're going to hit save and that should be it good now we've got our index.html you can go ahead and get rid of that text document if you have one and now what we're going to do is go ahead and copy the bootstrap software into our website folder and I want you to rename this now if you want to keep an original copy of this go ahead but I'm going to go ahead and rename this and we're just going to call this bootstrap all right let's close this out now next what I want you to do is go out to the jQuery website and what I want you to do is hit the download button right here and then what you want to do is download the production compressed version of jQuery and you should end up with a file that has a dot min extension now what we're going to do is go ahead and rename this as well and we're just going to get rid of the version so we're just going to call this jQuery dot min that's and then copy that into your website folder good we're making some progress here all right so let's go ahead and open up our index.html we're going to edit that with notepad plus plus if you do not have notepad plus plus please go out and download that you're going to need that for this series that is the editor that we're going to be using you can just go to google and do a google search on notepad plus plus and you will find the download page and it's a very very easy install okay so let's go ahead and walk through this first bootstrap template that we're going to be using now bootstrap is an html5 framework so you will need this doctype declaration and that's why this is in this template basically this will give us html5 and you'll remember that they change this in html5 so this will always pick up the current version of HTML you definitely want to set your language to whatever language you're using in this case it's English now you will notice in this template they have this one line right here read this very carefully the above three tags must come first in the head and any other head content must come after and they are referring to these three lines right here you can basically just forget about these but you need these first three lines and that's why they are in this template you really don't have to think about them much more than that I will tell you though that the UTF is used for security that's one of the primary reasons that's why they have that here this next meta tag has to do with compatibility with the latest version of ie in this case it's edge so that's why they have added this second line here bootstrap is considered a mobile friendly framework in fact they will called a mobile first framework and basically that's what this setting does right here it will ensure that mobile browsers render your web page correctly so that's why you need this meta tag right here now let's talk about the CSS stylesheet that bootstrap provides and in this case it's already pointing to the folder but we have another layer here right so let's go ahead and actually just slide this over and let's open up our website again and let's open up our bootstrap folder and here you see our CSS folder is right here and we're going to be using this bootstrap dot min folder this is sort of similar to jQuery where they have minimum production ready CSS and JavaScript file and this is the same for bootstrap we're just going to go ahead and use the same one that they're referencing but you'll notice that we have a bootstrap folder right here they are starting it out at the CSS folder so we need to put in we need to put in the bootstrap folder here so it finds the CSS file so we're just going to write in bootstrap and a slash or the folder there that's good now the bootstrap CSS file will be found now we're really not worried about these definitions for shim and respond we may talk about these later but I'm going to go ahead and just get rid of all of this right now it's commented out but it's a little junk in here that we just don't need right now so let's go ahead and just get rid of all that and now we have a cleaner head element good and here you can see they just put in a default here h1 with the hello world and we'll load the web page in a minute just to make sure everything's working now you can point to a CDN if you want for jQuery you can see the default template has that but of course we downloaded our own jQuery file so we're just going to go ahead and point to that and we know that that was called jQuery dot min dot Jas so we can go ahead and just get rid of all of this we don't need this anymore and that should be picked up there we go now we've got our jQuery min Jas which is in our root folder so we should find that just fine so let's go ahead and actually save this now now you might be asking well why do we need to reference a jQuery file well they tell us right here it's necessary for bootstraps javascript plugin and it's the same thing we also need a JavaScript file and as you can see our bootstrap folder that we downloaded earlier already has a JavaScript file that we can use we just need to go ahead and put in that bootstrap folder again and there we go so let's go ahead and save this now and let's load it up and make sure everything's working just fine and it is good so that's all we really need to get going early on we have everything we need in this default template so we're good to go I also will create a link to this source as well if you want my edited version ok I will see you guys in the next video thank you
