when we last left off we had finished our markup so now I'm going to return to Photoshop so that I can begin slicing out any necessary assets and the point of this is we need to take any images or icons anything that cannot be recreated with HTML and CSS and this is very simple and I did this on purpose so we're not focusing too much on Photoshop the first step is we do want that image so I can do that by selecting the cursor tool and I'm going to come up here and choose auto select and make sure layer is selected now when I click on the image if you refer down to the bottom right hand corner you'll see that we select that layer and if I turn that off you'll see the image is gone all right so now if I want to select the image because all I want is to capture that single image and save it there's a couple different ways but this is the way I prefer I'm going to hold down alt or command on the Mac and click within this thumbnail right here and now when I do this you're going to see that what we call marching ants will be selected around the entire layer now the problem with this is this image appears to be much larger and I bet you can tell because if we were to move it around we can see different parts of the image now we want to keep it as it was before but we only want to select this area so I could do it manually like so another way would be to select the mask and if you look right here you can see this is where the designer masked the image what he wanted to show what is white will be what is displayed and what's black is what's hidden but if I once again alter command click that selects that one area and then I'm going to come back click on the thumbnail and copy it by pressing ctrl or command C now that's copied I'm going to create a new file file new and now what you'll see right here is the width and the height have been set to the exact dimensions of what is stored in the clipboard I'll click OK and now ctrl or command V to paste that in and there we are we have our background image so if you've used Photoshop before you might be used to save as but in our case we want to save it for the web so I'm going to come down - and click this one right here next we want to specify the format do we want it as a JPEG or a pink as a quick rule of thumb anything that is a photo should be jpg anything that is much more simple may be solid colors no gradients you would use a pink and anything that should have a transparent background you would always use pink 24 so I'm going to stick with JPEG because this is a photo and you can see here the ultimate file size and you always want to pay attention don't simply raise the quality as much as possible because the file size is going to increase and it's going to take longer for your website to load so instead what you want to do is reduce the file size or the quality as much as possible until you see a noticeable decrease in quality and right now hopefully you can see this it's beginning to look a little more pixelated and of course it is we're at 12 so a good rule of thumb is to keep it right around 60 that way it still looks rather nice and our file size is 49 K a little large but it should be doable next I'm going to click Save and now we're going to specify where this should be saved to it's going to go on our website in the images folder and I'm going to call it City - eg but feel free to call yours whatever you like next we're going to hide this and add it to our website now remember we're not adding this to our markup we're adding it to our stylesheet so normally you would slice everything out of Photoshop first but for now just to give you a quick glimpse of how it works let's do it this way and now we need to target banner right here so I will say banner and give it a background of URL and we're going to link to the image that we saved in this case IMG city - BG jpg but as we learned in a previous lesson because we're within the CSS directory we have to go up to the root and then into the image so I will do period period forward slash next I'll save it and make sure this is called style dot CSS finally after background if we want the background to repeat which is the default this is the default we can specify no-repeat so we have a single background image now let's see how this looks in the browser if I reload the page you're not seeing anything at all and it should be right within here so if you need to debug right click inspect element and let's come down and take a look I'm going to click on here and notice it's not finding it at all and if you're wondering why well of course it's because we've created a style sheet but we have not linked to it so we'll add our website name my website or it should be called black and white and next we will link to that style sheet CSS style dot CSS reload and now it's being displayed but now you can see that the image is much larger than the content so it's cut off but what we really want to do is make sure that the content is the exact width of this image if I close it out you can see the image takes up the entire area so that's the next step is to figure out what the width is of our image we can do that in a couple ways one you can right click on the file within finder or within windows and view the information or you can open it from Photoshop and we'll do that now and now I can go up to image and choose image size and we can see right here it's in pixels if yours is set to percent make sure you're viewing pixels because that's what we're working with it's 695 by 231 so that's good for the time being and we're going to set this to width of 695 height of 231 pixels and now let's reload and now we have that full area so good you sliced out your first asset now let's see if there's anything else that we need for this you might be wondering how we're going to get this nice transparent background right here we can do that all with CSS we can create these buttons with CSS is there anything else we need not really this is a fairly simple web site if we want and just to learn we're going to slice out black and white because that could be in a special font and it's good to see how you would do it if you need it to so once again I'm going to select the cursor tool and I'm going to click on the logo and right here we're going to copy it so once again I hold commands down and it creates the marching ants next I copy it by pressing ctrl or command C and this time rather than pressing file I'm going to press ctrl or command in to create the new file at the exact dimensions we require next command or control V and that pasted in but in this case notice we still have the white background and what we really want is to specify the background with our HTML and we don't want to see this white background if we want a red background so we're going to turn off right here and now you can see the checkered background refers to transparency next step is to save this for the web so we can go to file save for web or on the Mac it's shift control option s next I want you to notice that somehow that background showed up again well that's only because we have specified jpg and remember earlier I noted anything that is transparent we should use pink 24 now when I do that that will come back up and we'll click Save and now I'm going to save it as logo good so now we're going to add that one in as well and once again we're going to use image replacement so I'm not going to add an image here so you could if you wanted we're instead going to target it header h1 background is going to be URL IMG logo dot PNG let's see how that looks reload and now notice it's repeating over and over and that's because the default of repeat is in effect here because we have not overwritten it so I'm going to remove that and now it's been displayed but again as we've learned the regular text is displaying as well so we need to use text and dent negative huge number this is an arbitrarily large number and that's going to push it off the page and also to make sure that it is displaying I am going to get the image size so once again I can go to image image size or on my computer I can press option command I and here I'm going to make sure that the dimensions of my h1 is set to this one 74 by 23 reload and now you can see it's pushed up a little bit because now we've specified the exact dimensions that we require and now we're done with Photoshop for this page and this is why I kept it simple so we can get back into the HTML and CSS
