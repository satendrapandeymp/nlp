hi guys my name is Karthik and I am from issued a dimension comm and this is a new video to demonstrate how this whole studio 2017 looks like in Mac operating system so just a week before Microsoft Visual Studio released Visual Studio for Mac and I'm very excited to see c-sharp running in a Mac operating system and we all know that the Nano project of Microsoft dot and frameworks fork branch started to work with and they started to work before in a year or two I guess and these mono framework was really really cool because it runs on Linux Mac and Windows operating system so this is really a breakthrough for Microsoft because now we cannot say that dartnet can run only in Microsoft Windows operating system rather it also run in Mac and Linux operating system so that paved the way for developing Visual Studio IDE for Mac operating system as well so for that I'm going to just install the Visual Studio in our Mac operating system I have already installed that but I can quickly show you how the visual studio looks like so you can just go to the visual studio comm and here you can see that they have released a missile Studio IDE for Mac operating system as well so you can see that not this one the Visual Studio code this is available already for pretty long time it also runs in Linux and Mac operating system along with Windows operating system but this one is new Visual Studio for Mac so we'll quickly see how it looks like but again don't get carried away that you can develop a WPF application or you can do some of the great things like installers which you can do in Visual Studio for Windows operating system but this Visual Studio for Mac is the IDE to mainly develop the mobile applications and cloud applications that word the caption is you can see Visual Studio for Mac is a mobile-first cloud-first ide made for the Mac so let's quickly dive into this so for that first we need to download the Visual Studio for Mac I can just go over here and then I can download the Visual Studio for Mac so this will basically download a dot dmg file in your Mac operating system and then you can start installing from there so I have already downloaded that and you can see in my downloads I have this visual studio for Mac preview install dmg and I have also installed this in my machine it's very very simple all its going to do is just Next Next Next and you can do the installation but let's quickly open the visual studio and write our first code and see how it works so for doing that I'm just going to do a search for Visual Studio there we go alright so the Visual Studio is opened and right now I'm just going to write a very very simple code so the first time you can see that this IDE is kind of different from what we see in our actual Windows operating system this kind of very cool kind of neat and you can see there is a sign-in out here and you can see the getting starter so you can see the getting started actually available in this pane but right now it has been moved in here for the visual studio for Mac right so let's create a new project I just created a first project just to see how it works but yep it's is not working because you need to do a lot of other additional stuff to make this code actually running and you can see that there is a multi-platform option here for the apps and you can see xamarin form and within the xamarin form you have the four maps connected apps native iOS apps and games so basically you can develop the mobile application using xamarin but you can see that there is nothing called Windows application or something like a WPF application out here is completely mobile applications that you can develop and you can dollop the application for iOS TV iOS and Android and you can see that you can of course develop a Android application as well using xamarin again and there is a dotnet core this is what we are very much interested in right now we are actually going to write our console application on Mac this is really really exciting right we were writing this console application so far in Windows operating system but this is the first time we're going to write a console application in Mac operating system and you can also develop a asp.net core app web application on Mac we can actually see this in another next video but for now we'll just look into this application the console application for dotnet right so I'm just going to select this and I'm going to hit next and you can give the name of the project so you can give any name so I'm actually going to give what is called as first demo and then you can also select the use get for version control if you want but I'm just going to leave it as it is for now and I'm just going to create and you can see that it is also showing you the folder structure actually it's sitting in users Karthik projects and there's a first demo and there's a certain file and there is a CS Prachi ice well which is also cool I'm just going to create it right now so it is creating the project it's restoring the package for the project you can see that it is actually restoring the NuGet packages basically for our project so that you can see these references will be added sorry the dependencies will be added in here the nuclear dependencies like nougat Microsoft dot and SDK and microsoft.net core app so these two will basically be added for the first time for you and once you see by expanding this dartnet core app you can see all the libraries the Microsoft c-sharp library microsoft.net core dotnet host policy and Dartmouth standard libraries and all the important library which we require for writing the code in c-sharp will be available over here so basically Microsoft has just published all the libraries the DLL files into you get right so if you trying to run this particular project I basically got an message saying I don't have the dotnet core we go it says the doctor the court is required to run this application we need to download this dart nerdcore basically so what is going to happen is it's going to open the browser for us and it's going to show me that we need to first install this dotnet core but before installing there's the trigger set again it's nothing but the home view it's more like the chocolaty for windows again chocolaty is something we have already discussed in our excel automation channel so if you see how it looks like it's basically a PowerShell which works like a nougat for Windows and similarly there is a homebrew which is like chocolaty for Mac so I'm just going to open the terminal and there is an installation guide so install home Brio so I'm just going to follow the same instruction I have not did this ever in my lifetime so far and this is the first time I'm going to do so just bear with me and see if it really works so what is it says press return to continue there we go and it's asking me for my password so right now it is downloading the homebrew and also it is installing I don't know how long will it take so I'll be back once the downloading and installation is done alright seems like the homebrew is installed right now and let's see what else we need to do homebrew on install the file outside is prefix and you can place the homebrew installation where you like and there is something like homebrew formulas are simple Ruby script and I don't know what is this so basically I'm not going to be very much interested in these things rather I have installed homebrew which is the only thing I can do and then after installing the homebrew you do the following so it says brew update mmm I think I don't have any update because I just installed it so even if I do update that doesn't make any sense alright it says already up-to-date and then it says brew install open SSL so we can run that so it is installing the open SSL and then we need to do something called as make directory for this guy that you user local lib so basically I guess it's going to put all the libraries in required for our dotnet core so I'm just going to paste it over here and then I'm going to start it okay so that's been created and then we need to add a link I guess there we go and then the finally the last line so I'm just going to do that as well oops what happened okay control windows we there we go super cool so everything is done the pretty cool side is over right now and then install the.net core sdk so installing the dotnet core sdk the best way to install a current core on mac is to download the official installer so let's do that alright so it seems like it's around 50 MB so once the downloading is done I'll be back alright seems like the downloading is over so I'm just going to open that and you're just going to start the installation for me all right so it says microsoft.net cores the Li I'm going to hit continue if continue again it says that I need to agree okay I agree that and then I'm going to stop so it's going to prompt me for the password alright access granted installation over super fast and it says that you want to move it to the trash of course support this is really good okay and you can see that my superstar because I have never used Mac in my lifetime so far and that's the reason I'm just getting excited for everything alright it says that downloading the dotnet core debugger hmm okay so I'm just running it right now and basically let's see what's going to happen we have already downloaded the darknet core library but still I think is going to add some references mm-hmm let's give them access again alright so let's try to run this again and see what's going to happen basically I should see the console output coming in okay it's kind of running and you can actually see the output I guess somewhere over here you can see that is something called as application output and we have our output here hello world super right you can see that it is basically doing a lot of things it's loading all the bins folder and the DLL file and then it is also loading the runtime DLL and most cough DLL console DLL else and all those zeros required and then it is executing the application and then we are getting our hello world out here which is kind of cool and very very interesting because this is the first time I am seeing Microsoft Visual Studio s code is actually running in a Mac operating system which is kind of very great and then let's try to see how the intelligence looks like so basically we used to do how once a console application is written the black window just appears and splashes out and disappears but we are seeing a different output here because there is nothing called as console in Mac operating system rather it should have open in the terminal but it did not it is showing the output in the application window so how is this console dot readline looks like console dot Wow just cool because I can see this very very neat and it also shows the intelligence help and there's a tool to help here with this summary so console dot I would read there we go super and then I'm going to save it and run it let's see what's gonna happen there we go hello world and it's actually expecting us to type something that's why it's just waiting so now if I just pass in some key out there in here hit enter neatly okay I don't know how to pass the key maybe I don't know I am just thinking just to hit somewhere and just the job but basically it's I don't know where to give the key entry so let me just stop the test maybe let's try to run something meaningful let's try to write create a method public void simple addition program and let's still integer a integer B and why don't we just return this guy return an integer and then let's try to return a plus B there we go and I'm just going to run to that value console dot write line off add off 21 comma 20 there we go so save it come on this so now the all right you can see that it is also showing us a very cool error here it says expect a bracket over there so I'm just going to put that and this is very very neat as well so let me run this oh yeah you know what I also forgot the static so Wow once I came to Mac I completely forgot the programming I should have given a static keyword here because we're running in a main method which is a static type here so should be static as well or you need to create a reference off the particular object so let's make that method name a static and try to run this hopefully this time it should run I could see that the debugging is working fine as well right there we go so 41 that's the output cool so everything is working so cool the Visual Studio IDE is very very neat compared to this was studio code for Mac and I guess this is really a great move for Microsoft to are enable people to execute a c-sharp program on Mac operating system once again thank you very much for watching these videos guys and have a great day
