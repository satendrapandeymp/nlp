hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad we know that we can set the border to any size file save go to browser refresh you can see that the border is set around the table I say here 10 pixels file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have a border around the table if we want we can keep a border color also by using the attribute Bebo rder border cyl war color maybe I same ma GE and t a magenta color I apply file save go to browser refresh you can see that the border is changed to the magenta color this is how you can apply the border color to the table if you do not want the border itself as I told you can set it to 0 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see that border is not available and we don't need the border color itself also I can delete this border option or a border attribute I can put only BG color tab file save go to browser refresh here you can see that table cells have some space between them right you can see there is a space between serial number table cell and one table cell that is actually called as cell spacing I am going to discuss about cell spacing now see e ll cell SP a see ing cell spacing we can give different pixel size maybe I give 3 pixels if I say you will see there will be a more gap between the cells files save go to browser refresh right you can see here if I say 10 pixels file save go to browser refresh can see that more cell spacing is added that means there is a space around the table cell is increasing if I increase more to 15 and say file save go to browser and refresh 20 pixels file save go to brow and refresh you can see the table width and height is increasing all right let me give more let's say 30 pixels file save go to browser refresh everything is working properly perfect if I say some specific fixed width and height then the table contents start getting wrapping I'm going to show that let me say here I say table width should be maximum I say here 400 pixels I said the table with 2 400 pixels this time check out what happens to table cells if i refresh table cells are now changing and also you can see that s stood name is getting wrapped right wrapping is happening serial number if you want to reduce the cell spacing you can reduce it 1 pixel file save go to browser and refresh okay if you do not want any cell space you can set 0 cell spacing file save go to browser refresh there is no space between the cells okay I am going to discuss about cell padding let me give here cell spacing to 1 pixel save file save go to browser refresh see e ll cell P a double D ing cell padding is the distance between the text from the border of the cell you can see here we have the border of the cell and if I give cell spacing more maybe 5 pixels file save you will see there is a distance refresh increase between the cell border and the text let me give here 20 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see that there is more space right I can set the width W ID th width equal to 400 pixels again file save go to browser refresh it looks like this I can give the height also hei gh T height equal to maybe 300 pixels I say file save go to browser refresh you can see as we have given cell padding more cell height is not reducing I can give cell padding to maybe 5 pixels file save go to browser refresh you when you can give the width and height in percentage with respect to the parent window width and height here if I say 100% then the width of the table fills the entire width of the browser window file save your browser refresh you can see that the width increase the width will get increased if I increase the browser window width also can you see that automatically the table is getting stretched and squeezed if I say here height is equal to 100% file save go to browser refresh instead of pixels I'm using 100% or in percentage I am mentioning if i refresh you can see that the table field entire height if I reduce the height of the browser window automatically the table is getting squeezed can you see that and stretch let me put it back to 400 pixels and height I mentioned 300 pixels file save go to browser refresh and I remove the cellspacing 0 file save go to browser refresh let me add a border again Bevo rder border equal to 2 pixels file save go to browser refresh now I have added a border and also I mention here border color equal to I say ma GE n ta magenta b VAR d our border say 5 pixels file save go to browser refresh we have a magenta color applied so hope you guys have understood clearly all these attributes about table for this tutorial this much is inner friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next shuttle
