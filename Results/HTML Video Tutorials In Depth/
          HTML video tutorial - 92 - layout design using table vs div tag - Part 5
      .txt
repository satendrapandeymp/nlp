hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series from the past few video tutorial we are trying to design a web page layout by using table as well as by using div tag and we have created the similar layout by using table as well as the div tag this is how it looks what we have done actually to design a layout using table ease first we created a main table with the ID main container which is going to behave like a container for all our other tables so here the main container is going to actually wrap all tables you can see here we have one table with one TR and 1 TD inside that TD only we have two different tables you can see here this table has 1 TR 1 TD inside this TD only we have two different tables one is a header and another one is a navigation bar now you can see that is what we have here one is the header another one is nav inside the header table we created one more table with the two different columns one column holds the name another column holds the email ID you can see that we have here table header which has one TR and 1 TD inside that we created one table with two t DS 1 TD holds the name another TD holds the email ID then what we have created just below the table header we created a nav bar table you can see that is the nav bar table in that now bar we created one more table with one row 5 columns you can see that in this nav bar table we have 1 TR 1 TD in this TD we created another table with one table row and 5 different table cells that is what we have done so far by using the table tag quite simple now what we do in this video tutorial is we are going to add a main content area to this home page so to do that what I do is you can see here we have the table header and we have a table navigation bar here below the navel I am going to create one more table closing table and it holds one table row it is going to have only one table row and 1 TD opening TD and closing TD and this table is going to have width of 100% and it is going to have height of 400 pixels and it is going to have BG color of lig hasty light gray color in this TD I am going to put some content that is going to be home page content area so if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we got one more box here one more section you can say this is going to hold the main content of our home page or qualification details or experience page like that this is going to be the main content as it is going to be main content I am going to identify this by an ID main and then I am going to align the text to center of the TD file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now there are text is aligned center we have created a main content area quite simple right same thing we are going to perform in layout design using div also you can see what I can do is I can create one more div for this table and apply these properties by using CSS let me go to layout design using div what we have done here is we created one day which is going to become a main container which holds all other divs in this main container only we have header div and nav div that is what we find here header div and narrative and in the header div we created two more divs both are floating to the left and one holds the name another holds the email id you can see here in the dev header we created two divs one holds the name another holds the email id and both are floating to the left and when you see the navbar div it has only one div and we have aligned it to the center and it has 800 pixels width that you can observe here so let's add the main content area to do that so here we have a header div then we have a nav dip below the Navdeep I am going to create one more div with the ID as main and it is going to have the style so I am going to use CSS style width of 100% semicolon then hei ght height of 400 pixels semicolon and it is going to have background - color li GST light GRA VY light gray semicolon double quotations flows and then I close the div here and inside this div I am going to put the content as homepage content area you can see that width it is going to have 100% height it is going to have 400 pixels light gray background color file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we got a section or main content area created in the web page and the text is not sent of a line so to do that what I do is I am going to use text align property text - el el i GN align cen ter Center semicolon file save code browser and refresh can see the text aligned to the center now top I have to align this text in the middle here so to do that I am going to use padding so I use here PA double D ing padding - top I set 200 pixels you should remember that as we are adding padding the height of the div is going to increment to 600 pixels right because 400 plus 200 it is going to become 600 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that but I want the height of this div should be 400 only to do that I am going to subtract this to 200 file save go to browser and refresh you can see now we have required layout by using the dev also write quite similar hope you guys have understood now we add a footer at the bottom so let's add it I go to the layout using table dot HTML page below this main table I am going to create one more table opening table and closing table this is going to have a ID of footer and it is also going to have width of 100% and hei GST height it is not going to have height or we can put height also no problem like 50 pixels height we put and then we set the background color BG color equal to black and then this is going to have 1 TR closing TR and it is going to have only 1 TD closing TD and in this TD we are going to have a Content as at the rate copyright copyright of course if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh you can see we have a footer added and the content is not getting displayed in this place so it is also aligned to the left hand side you can see what we can do is first thing I am going to use the font color I set it to white and here I say closing font tag file save go to browser and refresh now we have the content displayed and then I am going to say here align cen ter center file save go to browser and refresh you can see now we have at the rate copyright we can increase the height if we want it is 100 pixels or 200 pixels we can set there is no problem save go to browser and refresh you can see now we have a proper layout created then same thing we can do in layout design using div dot HTML page also to do that go to create one div with the ID footer width 100% height 200 pixels background color black let's do that here after the main div I am going to create another div with the ID of footer and style I am going to set width of 100% semicolon then I am going to say here height of 200 pixels semicolon then it is going to have background - color or black and that's it and then I say here closing div and here I am going to say at the rate copyright content file save go to browser and refresh I think I made mistake here I didn't close double quotation file save go to browser and refresh you can see that I got another div but the content is here at the top let's change things first thing I am use a span tag and I use a style attribute and I am going to set the color to white semicolon here I closed the span file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now the text is visible in white similarly I am going to set here text - align to Center semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that text is aligned to the center then I am going to set padding top PA double D ing padding - top - 100 pixel and I am going to set the height to 100 pixels 100 + 100 is going to become 200 file save put a browser and refresh you can see that now we have achieved the desired layout that we want by using the table as well as div I hope you guys have understood how do we think with respect to table while creating layout and how do we think with respect to div while designing a layout of web page it is quite simple I suggest you people to watch these videos again and again and understand each and every part so that you can be able to create any other layout easily and also I suggest you to try creating complete website itself for example you try to create your own profile by using the div and by using the table layout that we created all you need is you just need to create different pages you need to copy paste the same code in every page only modification you need to do is in this table TD in this content area you just need to replace the content for if it is education details page put the education details here that's it that's what you need to do I hope you guys have understood for this tutorial this much is enough friend I show you more layout designs how do we do by using table and div for this tutorial this much is you know friends for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefitted keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
