now in this video I'd like to talk a bit about what exactly are going to be expecting from the course that I have here on my channel regarding HTML and CSS now as time goes quality gets updated from from time to time because you move you go to a new location you get better equipment so as time goes inside this course here as well you're going to experience a slightly different quality change inside some of the lessons now I will point out one thing that's really important to point out about my specific course here which is that whenever something gets updated in real life meaning that there's something new added to HTML or CSS I always update my lessons and include new lessons into the course in order to keep you guys updated when it comes to creating HTML and CSS so what I'm basically trying to say here is that the first lessons in this course you're not going to be as high quality visually as the later episodes in this course but they're still relevant to what you're going to learn so don't get fooled by the quality of some of the all the lessons that aren't this course here now just to talk about Who I am is to teach it here in the channel my name is Danny Nelson I live in Denmark and doing you to appear is something that I recently jumped into full-time at thesis I'm uploading this video now education wise I have a Bachelor in web development and multimedia design which is also why I love to teach these specific subjects on this channel here my original plan was actually coming University teacher but then YouTube sort of happened and now I'm here teaching you guys with something I think it's better when it comes to reaching out to more people so I hope to be able to share my knowledge with as many people as possible around the world now I should also mention that inside most of my lessons inside this channel here including this course you're going to be finding all the lesson files in the description of the video where you can download them on a patreon so if you want to support me on patreon then you'll have access to all the lessons files and these lesson files are available in case you need any sort of extra help when it comes to these lessons inside HTML and CSS so having said all this I hope that you will enjoy my lessons and I hope to see you in the next episode [Music] [Music]
