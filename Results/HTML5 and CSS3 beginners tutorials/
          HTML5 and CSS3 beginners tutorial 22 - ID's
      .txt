hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 22 and in this tutorial I am going to show you guys how to style elements on your web page using an ID okay now if you guys watch the previous tutorial then you know that in that tutorial I spoke to you guys about classes and if you guys didn't watch that tutorial then I'm going to make a few references to that video now but basically the difference between a class and a ID is that they work pretty much the same but an ID has to be unique to each element so in other words let's say you wanted a lot of elements on your page to look the same so you had like 50 elements or 10 elements on your web page that you wanted to all look the same then you need to go ahead and use a class to style those elements but if you only have one element that you want to style then it's okay to use an ID reason for that is because IDs have to be unique to each element it'll partly work if you try use two elements with the same ID with CSS but if you ever try and use two elements with the same ID and then once you add javascript to the page later and select that element by ID you're going to confuse the heck out of JavaScript basically so just don't use two elements with the same ID as soon as you need two elements that have to have the same ID you should probably be styling using a class just putting that out there and I know I actually rambled on for quite a long time but now let's go ahead and actually put some elements on our page that we can style so I'm going to go ahead and actually create three different paragraphs over here so I'm just going to place my cursor right before those paragraph tags and push ctrl D and that will duplicate the paragraphs okay so our first paragraph can just say I am blue and straight out of the previous tutorial we are going to turn this paragraph blue the second paragraph I guess can say the same thing we did in the previous tutorial which it was just like oh boy I wish I were blue or red actually because we want to turn this one a different color to that one so boy I wish I were red and then the last one can say if it's yellow let it Mellow and that's actually kind of disgusting but yeah I've heard people say that before it's kind of catchy okay so basically what I want to do in this tutorial is obviously turn this paragraph blue this paragraph red and that paragraph yellow now to do that I'm going to use an ID so I don't know why I keep going to my CSS sheet I don't want to go there yet I'm going to use an ID so I'm going to go ahead and add that in as an attribute in my first paragraph so I'm going to give this an ID of blue and the second one will give an ID of red and the third paragraph we can give an ID of yellow okay and now all we have to do is go over to CSS and select these paragraphs by their actual ID and the reason that we'll the way you do that is you basically have to tell CSS okay listen up a one two style using an ID and the way you do that is obviously by just using this hashtag I don't know why I said obviously because it's not obvious I'm showing you guys this for reason okay so basically go ahead and use this hashtag and then go ahead and type in your ID name so my first ID is blue so I'm going to go ahead and put in blue over here and now I can style my first paragraph and I think what I'm going to do is just change the color to blue and then we'll go ahead and style the red ID so hashtag red and that'll change the red ID so we'll go ahead and say color easy on the caps lock over there color red and then the last one can be or we got to select the idea of yellow and we'll go ahead and change this color to yellow but I'm going to give it a background color of black just so that we can actually see it because yesterday or in the previous tutorial you guys couldn't actually see the yellow text so let's go ahead now and run this in Firefox and as you can see I've now been able to use these IDs over here to actually style all the paragraphs so we've got our first paragraph being blue the second one being red and the last one being yellow with a black background okay so that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this video and I hope you guys go ahead and start styling all your websites very nicely using the ID and class attributes just remember though if you're going to style more than one elements to look the same go ahead and use a class but if there's only one element then go ahead and you can use an ID and that'll work just fine so thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to like or comment on the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
