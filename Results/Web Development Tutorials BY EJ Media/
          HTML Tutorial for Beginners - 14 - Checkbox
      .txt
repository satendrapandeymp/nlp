in this video we're going to go over the checkbox now the checkbox is similar to what we did in the last video the radio button the only difference is you get to select multiple boxes at the same time now you'll remember in the last video with the radio button we only get to select one option so that's the big difference between checkboxes and radio buttons so we're using the input element tag again we're setting the type to checkbox we're not going to worry about named because once again that has to do with the server-side code which will deal with in future videos once again we don't have to close out the input element tag so we can put the label right after this angle bracket so the four options we're going to allow the user to select their football basketball baseball and hockey so let's go ahead and refresh this and you can see we've got our four options here and notice we can select whatever we want so once again this is very different than the radio button now what if you want to force one of these options to always be selected well we can use the checked attribute so let's say we want football to always be selected so we come in here we type in checked that's the attribute equals and we'll just say check again and let's go ahead and save this let's refresh this and now you see this is automatically selected now the user can deselect this if they want but the first time the page loads it will be automatically selected okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
