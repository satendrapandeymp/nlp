welcome to another free tip of the week brought to you by XS learning zone comm in today's tip I'm going to show you how to use images efficiently in your database if you have a database where you need to display pictures either in forms or reports for your users to see or for printouts then there are several different ways to put the images in your database for example let's say you're creating a basic employee database and you want to have a picture of each employee here's a simple employee table I've got an ID an employee name text field and an employee picture that's going to be an olee object what does that mean well it stands for object linking and embedding and it basically means I can copy and paste or insert any type of object that I want including pictures Word documents Excel spreadsheets PDF files you name it just about anything can go into an olee object to insert an item all you have to do is drop the OLT object on a form right click come down the insert object I'll pick create from file browse to where your objects are I'll select the bitmap picture like this laptop and then click OK click OK again and there you'll see the laptop has now been embedded inside of my database a copy of that picture is stored right in your table and you can move from record to record and have all that information displayed this also works well in reports now the problem with ol√° objects is that they take up a lot of space if you've got an employee database with let's say 5,000 employees and your pictures are let's say a megabyte a piece well you've got 5 gigabytes maybe even more of space in your database just for pictures and that's pretty big and of course as our access databases get bigger they get slower and a lot less efficient so if you have a database like this we want to have a picture associated with an employee or perhaps a picture of a product or any number of types of pictures and you only want to display the picture for the record or maybe on a report you may find that it's more efficient to store all those pictures on your hard drive or on your network server and just store the file name of the picture in your database so instead of using an o le object here I'll just make that a text field and I'll put the file name of the picture there now when you're setting up your table just put the file name of the employee picture here now I've got a network folder setup on my server with some pictures in it so I'll just copy and paste this here I'm going to copy and paste my folder location which is employee pictures there's the folder location backslash and then the name of any one of these files that are in here let's go with how about kids that JPEG I'll put that in there kids dot jpg there we go all right if it's on your local hard drive that might be C colon backslash images backslash Jo dot jpg for example all right I can copy and paste that in there and I've got Rick dot jpg and I've got another thing a soft ball dot jpg and you can use gifts and bitmaps in any kind of picture that you want now when you create a form based on this table create a form here's my employee T form you can see the employee picture comes in there let's go to design view when I click design view make some room down here in the detail section and we'll drop an image down here the image control is right up here in the ribbon it's this guy it says image click on that come right down here draw out a box for the image control now windows is going to open up your pictures folder and ask you to specify a picture but we're not gonna I'm just gonna hit cancel that'll leave you with an empty image box here access 2003 and earlier users you'll have to pick image but then you can erase it later open up the properties for this image control here's the properties let's give it a name instead of image six I'll call this employee image give it a good name now if we take a look at our form in form view you'll see that there's no picture down here even as I move from record to record the picture doesn't appear that's because the image control is blank so we have to use a little bit of code to tell the image control to set itself equal to this file how do we do that let's go back the design view now open up the form properties which we can get by double clicking right here where the rulers meets that brings up the form up properties go to the event tab and you're looking for the on current event the on current event runs when you move from one record to another or on the form is first opened hit the dot-dot-dot builder button there and pick code builder the visual basic editor window opens up and all we have to say in here now is employee image dot picture equals employee picture and that's it employee image is our image control we're going to set the picture property and we're going to set it equal to our employee picture field which is a text field that has the file name in it all right save it save this as employee F it's my employee form right and let's see if it works let's go back to form view oh there it is now I move to the next record right down here click there's me click as a softball and you can see how with one line of visual basic code we can store all of our images in a folder either on our computer or on a network server and have them loaded in at runtime instead of saving all that extra stuff in our database now that's just the tip of the iceberg I have a whole seminar it's three hours long to teach you everything you've ever wanted to know about using images and graphics and attachments and all kinds of great things like that in your access they the basis if you're going to be storing images or pictures employee pictures product pictures any of that stuff in your databases you should watch this seminar we'll build a complete database system I'll teach you about Oh le objects not only will I show you how to right click and insert an object but we'll use some vb code so the user can just click one button and pick an object like the kids that jpg or this computer here hit open and it goes right in automatically will link that straight to a report alright here's another option over here for storing a resume like a word document in the employee file will do a lot more with the image controls just like I showed you I'll show you how to set up a shared imaging folder and better yet I'll show you how when the user selects an image if that image doesn't exist on your server in the shared folder it will copy it up there automatically so your users can pick files that exist on their own local computers and automatically have them copied up to your server directory you'll learn how to use the web by displaying images that appear on a website in your databases and that's really handy if you've got let's say a product database up on the web already and you want to be able to use the images out of that product database in your local Access database either in your reports or your forms you'll learn all about the new attachment type that came out with Access 2007 we'll use some vb code so we can browse the different attachments that are in one record and even open them up by double-clicking on them in here you'll learn about unbound holy objects we'll take for example an Excel spreadsheet and put that right inside of an Access form so your users can access the functionality of Excel right inside of your database and there's so much more to learn about images and databases I've got a three hour seminar that teaches you pretty much everything you've ever wanted to know just go to my website access learning zone comm and look for the access imaging seminar
