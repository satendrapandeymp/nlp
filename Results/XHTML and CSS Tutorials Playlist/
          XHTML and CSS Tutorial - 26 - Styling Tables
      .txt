alright guys welcome back to your 26th CSS and XHTML tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be styling some tables it's going to be nice so let's go ahead and jump right into it so let's go ahead and make a table let's go ahead and make like two rows and three columns nice and simple so table and of course you need one of those so ending table and let's just go ahead and make our rows first typical row terr and a nice little tear right there and let's just go ahead and add our cells table data ending table data and what are we going to put in here I love Bucky and just go ahead and copy this so it gives us three columns so now we have a table with one row and three columns in it so if we want in another row to be lazy just go ahead and copy this and paste it right underneath there so now if we save this and take a look at it here is our table right there if you highlight it you can kind of see the rows and columns easier so we have two columns I mean excuse me two rows three columns looking pretty good so what now we're looking at this table and we already know how to add a border but I mean border I mean come on we can do a little bit better than that so let's go ahead and style this up and I you know make it nice and fancy so let's go ahead up in here up in here up in here y'all going to make me alright anyways nothing me singing let's go ahead and first of all we want to style the overall table and whenever we do this the entire table is going to be affected so later on well you'll see what happens later on so let's go ahead and just give this overall border we'll use that shortcut so we don't have to define each one individually just make it like three pixels on solid blue so let's go ahead and save this refresh and see what we got so now around the entire table we have a border that's three pixels it's and it's blue exactly what we expected but now what if we want to do something a little bit fancier what if we want to say alright I want to change these rows individually to uh I don't know with a background of yellow or something and then even furthermore I want to take each individual cell and around each individual cell I want to add a border so we have six individual box looking things well actually it is possible to do that and see I says so let me go ahead and show you guys arm let me go through and do that for you guys and then I want to go over a few things so let's go and for our table row what I say background color yellow not yellow yellow that's the old butter yellow you there get it in certain phone that's pretty corny joke anyways so now if we go ahead and save that check it out refresh and now the entire row is yellow and this row is yellow too I mean why wouldn't it be so let's go ahead and take that table data which is of course the individual cells and what I say like add a border so border equals two picks I'm not solid we are to use solid dashed red so let's go ahead and save this and refresh it and see what we get we get a nice - pixel - red border across each one of these cells and the thing I wanted to mention is this even though we have a style applied to each individual piece of data and also a style applied to each row whenever you apply a style to the individual pieces of data it doesn't override on the table row the table row stays in the table data gets inherited so by that I mean here's what I'm trying to say whenever you make your table row yellow and then you make your table data whatever you want it doesn't replace the table role since you did this everything gets inherited down so whatever you did table gets affected on the whole table whatever you did to the table row gets affected in the table row and the table data and whenever you do to the table data affects only that table data I mean I probably just confusing you guys even more by saying on that but I mean if you just look at what's going on you can understand how it works in that it's not really overwriting anything it's just adding to it that's I guess a more simple explanation so anyways that is the basics of how you style a table and check it out this is a lot better than you know just adding a border to the table now you can do stuff like this and make your table a lot more easier to read and just give you the idea that you can in fact style tables just like any other XHTML element so anyways thank you guys for watching uh go have fun styling your tables and when you're ready I'll see you in the next tutorial
