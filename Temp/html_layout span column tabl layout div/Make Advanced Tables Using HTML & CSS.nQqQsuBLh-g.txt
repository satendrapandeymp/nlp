in today's video we're going to have a look at creating a table using HTML and a bit of CSS to style it up as you can see it is a little bit more complex than the previous tutorial what we have got here is the AFL ladder for 2015 and how the top eight teams and finished up okay so what we're going to do is go over to our Council first of all make ourselves a new folder called lesson six AFL ladder from there we open it up we make ourselves an images folder and inside images we've got two pictures one of them is the background that we're going to use for this webpage this is a black and white picture of the MCG and the other one we don't actually use this picture in the website but this is just a picture from the actual AFL comm website where we've got the top eight teams and all those stats that we are going to include in our webpage when it sounds just a bit of a reference there so once you have got your - at a folder made with images inside of it you can go into brackets here and we're going to start by making a new file before you start typing remember to go to save as and go into your accounts and find that less than six folder you just created remember don't go into images just stay in that less than six folder give it the name letter dot HTML and forget dot HTML so the computer knows you're making a web page and there we go we're good to go ready to start making our page let's start like usual by throwing in the doctype tags doctype HTML below that we'll set up our HTML tags inside those so indent them along one line we've got our head tags inside the head put a title to begin with and the title today is AFL top eight a lot we will come back to the head section bit later on and add our CSS into there so our style tags but for now we're just going to set up the body part of our web page so in the body today we've got a table and that's what it begins with some let's put in our table tag to start with inside the table we usually start with a table header row or th tag okay we're not going to do that today so in the first row said T our first row we're going to put a TD tag this table data it's just general data going into the table and that TD tag we've got our header okay it's basically going to say 2015 AFL letter top eight and I would like to make that a h1 heading something a little bit bigger so I might just put some h1 tags around the outside of that header okay and once we've done that and we'll just press ctrl s and we'll go and have a look at how that's going so I'll open it up from my accounts a little bit slow this computer there it is okay so we've got our title at the top the AFL top eight letter and this is our header row which is the h1 heading and it's also the first row of our table it means the first row there and the TR makes a new row in your table TD the table data tables lets you populate that grow with some information let's go down a couple of ones and we will make the next table row so in the second row of our table what we've got is the header rows okay so we're going to need the th tags I'm going to copy and paste this another six times so in total we've got seven of these th 2 X 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so there's going to be seven different columns in this table each time is a th it makes a new column in that row ok so let's start with the first column in the table and it's going to say pause which stands for position that's what position the team came next column across will be the name of the club the P stands for how many games they played W stands with the amount of wins they had L is how many losses they had d for how many draws they had pts stands for the number of points they received at the end of the season so that table row there contains seven columns if I press control us and save it we'll go and have a look at those seven columns ok quite ugly at the moment is the first column that has our header in position and then we've got their six other columns very bunched together over on the side there okay so what we're going to do is keep adding to this table we're going to make it look better later on using CSS but for now let's just get the information in this table so I'm going to add the third row to my table now and look back to TD tags this general table data I'm just going to copy and paste the TV's the number six times so then that was seven of them and we're going to put in the next row the team that came first on the ladder so their position was first soaping the number one in the second column we put the name of the team so I was Fremantle Dockers in the third row how many games they played was 22 how many wins they had seventeen how many losses they had and it was five how many drawers they had zero and the amount of points ended up on at the end of the season was 68 so in this row the third row of our table seven columns again each column has a little bit of data that will go under each of these headings that were listed above I'll press ctrl s to save it we'll go and have a look you can see their position was first clubs free are Dockers play 22 games 17 wins five losses 0 draws and 68 points ok looks ugly as I said but we're just going to keep working with it we'll make it look better later on next time ok let's copy and paste the TV's in seven times now we do the tender came second the team that came second was West Coast Eagles and from here we got 23 points 16 wins five losses they had one draw and 66 points so what ended up on I'm going to keep going here and I'll add the third and the fourth team in this is the third team one two three four five six put in the table data seven times with a genie that's me seven columns to that row third team Hawthorn Hawks he's a hawthorn he played 22 games 16 wins and 6 losses 0 draws and 64 points ok - even quicker I'm going to copy that entire row now so TR to TR I'm going to copy it and paste it in below and I'm going to change third place to fourth place and Sydney Swans is the next team all right at the top four teams in our table I'll just do a couple more my do the top six so I don't waste too much time this video feel free to fast forward it if you know what you're doing Richmond Tigers came in fifth position with 15 wins and 7 losses and they ended up on 60 points all right so let's just copy and paste that one more time so coming in sixth position we had the western bulldogs and then they had 22 games played 14 wins and 8 losses so let's change 14 and up to 8 0 draws and ended up on 56 points all right so you should do the next two teams as well we still have Adelaide Crows and North Melbourne kangaroos that you can add to your table but the safe time I'll leave them out so our rows closed off our table is closed off body and HTML sections all closed off so that's looking good I'll press control us to save it and you'll see that this table will become populated with a bit more data ok start to look a bit nicer now a little bit more structure to our page all right so once that's in that's all the data we might as well start making our page look a bit nicer now with a bit of CSS styling let's go back up the top here well I say remember inside the head section we need to add some style tags so there's our style tags this is where our CSS code goes our styling code first thing I'd like to style up is the body section of our page I'm going to write the word body go to the next line and open a curly brace and then also go to the next line and close that curly brace off and add a line or blank row inside those two curly braces I'm going to write in what sort of things I want to style up in the body thing I usually start with is the fonts so I usually change the font family first and I love my son serif fonts you can choose another phone if you'd like but since there's always good choice for our webpages and the size some font - size I usually stick with 1 a.m. ok so if I save that now make sure you semicolons at the end of those as well just close them off say that now on preview it let's see that our forms change to sans-serif and we've got one II M or a general size font in our web page might even change that 1 a.m. to 11 point they don't just stick with just the ends you can choose your exact size 11 point we'll just make it a little bit smaller okay I think it's going to look a little bit better in the long run so let's stick with that the other thing I want to style up in the body is the background okay we did have a picture in the background in the example so let's add that in now the way we do it is just right background - image and we choose oops we don't want that we choose the word URL okay and we just going to tell it where to find that picture from so we're looking at images folder and inside images we want to choose the background jpg picture let me put a semicolon at the end so let's look at that again we just say background image we need to find a URL or a link and we link it to our images folder and it's the background or jpg picture if I hover over that you'll get an example of what that looks like so I save it preview it we've now got a background image obviously way too big for this screen size so we might need to change that in our code make it look a little bit nicer so instead of having that massive size will change the background size but on background - size and choosing the word cover save that and show you what that does that will make the background image fit nicely within our screen okay that's looking a lot better now one issue you can't see on my screen right now but if you were using a bigger monitor like a 27-inch IMAX screen this picture would not be big enough to fill that web browser up and what it would do is would repeat itself over and over again just to fill up any white space it would look quite funny having a tiled background doesn't look very professional so what I'm going to do is stop that from happening so I'm going to write background - attachment and choose the word fixed put a semicolon at the end and just say that you won't see any differences whoops when i refresh that on mine but if you want a bigger monitor you would see that that picture would no longer tile itself across the page filling up white spaces alrighty so that's our body section all styled up still inside those style tags what I'm going to do next is add a border to the table so it's right in the word table and open up a curly brace and then close the curly brace and we'll add a new empty row inside those curly braces now what we're going to do is add a border so we write the word border it's right colon 1 pixel ok if I save that test it let's see what it does all right absolutely nothing yet so what we need to do is add a little bit more detail I'm going to put a space and run solid and then I'm going to put another space and write the black so our border now is 1 pixel it's a solid border and it's color is going to be black now when I save it and go and preview it we should start to see a border appear around our page let's see there it is quite ugly at the moment and it only goes on the outside of our table we want to get this border going through every row and every column inside our table so we need to add a little bit more styling to this table what I am going to do next to the word table here and add a little bit more in so I'm going to write comma th comma TD what that's going to do is put that border not only around my table which you've already seen but also around my heading rows and all my data rows all my cells inside my table so pretty much every so is going to have a border around it I press ctrl s and we're going to preview that here we go you see that looks a bit nicer now every row and column has been split up by a border okay here's an ugly border so let's go down back inside those curly braces again until that bought it to collapse like border - collapse and choose the word collapse and put a semicolon that will just collapse our border down into a single black skinny line any thoughts looking a bit nicer already the other thing I want to do to this table pop over here is change the opacity of it and what I'm going to do is make it 0.95 and then put a semicolon well you can't see that right now when I save this and go back over here and refresh it you're not going to see any changes but later I'm going to call this table in white and what we're going to do is just have it slightly transparent so you can see that picture in the background just coming through a little bit okay that's what opacity is how transparent something is - of that feature there is going to come in handy a bit later on that's all I'm going to style up on my table and my header and table data section for a minute what I'm going to do now is just do the th and TD sections okay so it's no longer affecting the entire table it's just affecting the header row and the table data rows so inside that we're going to put some padding around this table the padding is going to be 10 pixels if I save that you'll see that each column now each little cell will have a little bit of space around it a little bit of breathing room it's a lot easier to read after you add some padding I'm going to put the text align as Center okay it's not going to make a huge difference right now haven't resized our table but you'll see these number ones here two three four five six or the positions will come across to the center and all the text over here is sent it as well now all right we'll keep moving I'm going to close off the curly brace there for the th TD section now we're specifically going to work with just the table header so let's just do the th styling I'm going to give our table header section a background color so background color I'm just going to do a hexadecimal code for this one it's going to be a seven one two three four zeros plus semicolon if I hover over that you'll get an example of what collies and it's a reddish color on the next line we'll just put in a text color as well so the text color we just write color and so choose white I'll close my curly brace off so every time that th tag appears which is just this section this row here is going to have a background color of that reddish color and the text will be white let's save it and have a look okay there it is there this is the th section red background white text pretty simple I got the top in these style tags let's style up what else we got it's an interesting one we're going to start up every other row now to have every second row white color background and every other row a light gray color background okay so what we do is write TR : no spaces there we sort n th er stands for north and then child and in brackets mentor like the word even we'll open up a curly brace I'm going to choose a background color it's basically saying every second row needs to be this color so background color I want I'm going to go hashtag dat 88 do a semicolon close off the curly brace hover over that code and you'll see it's a light gray kind of color so every second row is going to be a light gray color so let's further damage is going to write the similar sort of thing so TR + th - child this time in brackets it's going to say odd right in in my curly braces this time I'm going to write background color and I'm going to make it white and then go down another line and close the curly brace save it up we'll go and have a look you'll see now we've got gray and white for our colors in the table okay you can just if you look closely see the background through the tables I was very slightly transparent if I was to go back and change in my table here the opacity so let's say 0.75 and save it you'll see that it becomes more transparent and you easily start to see that background coming through but all the text starts to fade out it becomes quite hard to read so leave that opacity at 0.95 okay so that's looking pretty good I might leave that styling for the minute okay it's mostly styled up I've got to do this top row which will do shortly okay so let's go back and we'll do a bit more editing on this table down the body section alright so in the body section let's find our table tag scroll down inside the body strap a lot we've got table and what I want to do first is just write a line oops equals an in quotation marks Center a little bit there we'll just push our table into the center of the page so we'll just say that give it a test run yeah it's looking good let's take up a lot of width on the page I might change the width of this table so what I might do is go up the top here and find table looked at it in actually now CSS will add a table tag here I've got curly brace and we've got width you can give it a percentage width so the width I want to make this table is about 80% of the page I'll do a semicolon close off the curly brace so that little bit of CSS styling should if I save it make our page oh sorry our table 80% width of the page here we go that's looking a bit nicer already on the other issue I'm having is this header up here 2015 a four letter top eight I'm going to stretch all the way across the top of our table here okay so what I'm going to have to do is go into my code and find that row where is it here it is just here this is our row what I'm going to do is go inside the TD section here this is the first column so it's showing that that piece of text only goes across one column inside the TD tag there I'm going to write with a space colspan equals and in quotation marks seven what that little piece of code code does is says span this row or this column sorry across seven different columns okay so I just minimize that for a minute instead of just spanning across this one column we want this row to go all the way across all seven of these columns and if i refresh it whoops I forgot to save it so I'll quickly save it we'll just go and test that one more time there we go so this spans across seven columns now that's a nice header row for our table I don't like the white color I don't want to change that to like a bluish color so what I'm going to do is go back to my code here is where it gets a little bit interesting what we've got is a TD tag here that we want to change okay just this one if I was to write up here on sober look if I was to write TD and open up a curly brace and write background color and we'll just make it what's the code I want I'll do a hashtag 0:05 cb7 close that off if I was to tell my TD tags to go that background color what's what's going to happen everything goes blue which is an issue I just want this top TD tag to go blue and these ones to remain the gray and white colors so what I'm going to do is just delete that TD section there I'm not going to make up a name for this tdj I'm gonna leave 2d there I'm going to give it an ID tag I'm going to an ID equals and I'm just going to write a header in quotation marks what that does is gives that row a unique name so if I want to style it up now all I need to do is write hashtag header up here and it should give that little bit of code there we'll give this row or this header row I blue background color okay so let's save that and test it beautiful and it doesn't affect any of the other tea details because because those TD tags don't have a unique name or an ID okay it's just this one TD tag here has an ID and whatever thing I just want to quickly add in there inside that header CSS tag there it's the color to be white that will just make our text white in color okay so let's just save that go back another look see if this changes yup sites what alrighty so as far as I can see that's basically a finished webpage I don't think there's anything there that I need to touch just make sure you've got the last two rows at it in so you've got the top eight letter I needed six save a bit of time that there is how you make a fairly advanced table in brackets using HTML and some CSS coding and he said you can go back and save that up and you are all finished
