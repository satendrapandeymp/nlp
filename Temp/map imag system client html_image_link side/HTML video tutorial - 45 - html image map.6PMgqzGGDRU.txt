hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss image maps how we can create hotspot areas on an image or how we can create more than one hyperlinks or hyper areas on an image first of all you can see here I have an image with the name image 1 and its file extension is JP eg let me add that to the page Here I am going to use IMG SRC equal to in double quotations I am going to say image 1 dot jpg forward slash greater than sign file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have image loaded in the web page now what I want actually means if I click on this rectangle area or my works rectangle box the browser should take me to my works not HTML page if I click on this about a circle area it should take me to about us dot HTML page that means I should be able to create here one hyperlink area and here one more hyperlink area if I use the anchor tag it is not possible right if I enclose this image tag in between the anchor tag closing anchor tag and I can write here hyperlink reference href is equal to I can say here about us dot HTML file save go to browser refresh if I move the mouse cursor check out what happens the mouse cursor is changed to the hand cursor you can see entire image got changed to hyperlink if I click on the image it goes to about us dot HTML page if I click on this about us area it goes to about us HTML page if I click on my works area it goes to about Us page only the reason is entire image is now a hyperlink or a hyper area you can say but what I want I want to create two different hyperlinks on this image as we know that it is not possible by using the anchor tag we have another way to create hotspot areas or more than one hyperlinks on an image and how do we do that let's understand file save go to browser refresh to create hot spots we need to create a map to create a map we are going to use map tag I am going to write here M AP map map tag is a pair tag so I must turn should write a closing map then inside the map we are going to create areas or a hotspot areas we same to create areas we are going to use area tag area tag is a unpaid tag you can see that I have opening and closing tag both in one tag area tag takes few attributes we have to assign values to those attributes let's begin first attribute is shape equal to in double quotations we have to tell to the system what type of shape that area should be I am going to say here rect then it is going to create a rectangle area if I say here circle Cir CLE circle then it creates a circular area I am want here rectangle area so I give shape equal to rect then we have to give coordinates see whoa-ohh RDS quads is an attribute which takes coordinates here you have to give left comma top comma R IG HT right comma bottom these four values you have to give what is the left value of this rectangle box what is the top value of this rectangle box or you can say what is the x value what is the Y value of this rectangle box then here you have to give what is X plus width W ID th width then you should give here what is y plus height hei ght height if you give these four coordinates then it will create the rectangle area how do I get the coordinate area of this rectangle box I need to take some software help here I have a Photoshop I will take a help of that and Photoshop is one of the best software or one of the greatest software for editing images working with raster graphics from the adop I say okay you can see I have a ruler also weaved you can see here the x value is actually 200 and the Y value is zero so what I do here I give the x value 200 the Y value I am going to give zero next I have to give X plus bit that is a right value so for right value you can see here that is 400 so 200 plus width is 200 here you can see 50 100 150 200 so 200 plus 200 is 400 that's what we have here X is 200 width is 200 is 200 plus 200 I am going to give here 400 similarly Y is 0 Y is 0 here 0 plus 200 is 200 I am going to give here 200 200 now what happens means it creates an area rectangle area on the image then we should tell hyperlink reference to which page it should move when I click on that area h r EF hyperlink reference i am going to say here my works dot HTML then the next step is i need to give a name to the map so i am going to say here name equal to in double quotations i can write any name i say here image map now this image map is going to be used by this image so i need to use an attribute called as use map in between I have tried hash then I should give this map name so that that image uses this map to create hotspot areas file save go to browser and refresh you should see this time if I move the mouse cursor you can see that mouse cursor is not changing to hand cursor but when I move the mouse cursor in this dangle area check out that this rectangle area is now a hotspot area or a hyperlink guys if I click on this it goes to my works dot HTML page my works HTML page has the title said to my works and in the body we just have welcome to my work space that's it if I go back and move the mouse cursor in the about area you can see that mouse cursor is not changing to hand cursor that means this area is not a hot spot area it's not a hyperlink so I need to create a hyperlink for this also right how do you create a hyperlink for this let's begin I need to create one more area in this map tag in between this map tag so I am going to say here area then I should tell shape what type of shape we want I am going to say here see IRC le circle then we should give coordinates Evo Ord s coordinates now coordinates for the circle we have to give is this center Center X comma Center Y then we have to give radius these three values we have to give so that the image creates a circular area on the image so let's find out what is the center X and center Y for this one so Center X for this is 300 and Center Y for this is 300 so for this image we have Center X Center Y is 300 300 Center Y is 3 hundred then radius I have to find out radius is this side if I go 50 and here 50 so that means 100 is the radius let me give here radius equal to 100 then I should use hyperlink reference href hyperlink reference Here I am going to say abo UT about us dot HTML it should go to about us dot HTML page then forward slash greater than sign file save go to browser refresh the page this time you can see if I move the mouse cursor in the about Us area you can see that it has got changed too a hyperlink area or a hotspot area can you see that if I move the mouse cursor outside you can see that we are getting the normal mouse cursor if I move inside we are getting the hand cursor now this is going to take us to about us dot HTML page about us welcome to about Us page if I go back and move to this area it will take me to my works not his tml page guys this is how you can create hotspot areas on an image you have to follow these steps how you can give or create different areas basically we create a rectangle area and circle area hope you guys have understood how we can create image map or hotspot areas on a single image and create more than one hyperlinks on an image similarly you can see here I have one more image you can create hotspot areas for each of these circles one will take two homepage one will take two my works one will take two about Us page one will take two experience that HTML page something like that you can create your own blogs also by using images one single image can have more than one links by creating your hotspot areas you can perform that so for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
