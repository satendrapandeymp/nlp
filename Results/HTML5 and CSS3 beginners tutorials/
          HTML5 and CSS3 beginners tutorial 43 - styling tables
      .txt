hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 43 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at styling our tables okay so I've actually gone back to the code from my introduction to tables tutorial so basically we have the same table as we had in that video which looks like this okay and now we're going to go ahead and actually start using the CSS file and style this table so the first thing I want to do is actually get rid of this border one attribute because we can actually use CSS to put our border onto the page okay and actually if I keep that there for a second you guys will notice that this border over here right now is kind of like a duplicate border so we've got two lines we've got one line around the entire table and then we've got a border around our in our actual cell so it like lands up in that duplicate border okay so what we can do to get rid of that is go over to our table so we're going to style our table just by selecting it by the tag and we can use this property called border collapse and then we can just set that equal to collapse just like that okay and when we save this now and go back to Firefox and click refresh you can see though all those borders have just collapsed so instead of having like that double border that we had a moment ago we now have a single border around every cell and that obviously just looks so much better okay then the next thing we can do is go back over to CSS and like I said let's get rid of this border because we can actually add that border in on with CSS so if I go over to my table over here and I just add in a border of one pixel solid black it's probably going to look exactly the same or you know so you guys think it's going to look the same but when I click refresh you can see that actually only adds a border around the outside of the table so we still need to add a border around our table hitters and our table cells so to do that we just go ahead and grab our table header and I'm going to place in a comma here because this just means I'm going to select more than one tag at a time and so I'm going to place in TD so that's going to select all table headers and table data and we're just going to go ahead and actually add in this exact same rule border of one pixel solid black when I go back and click refresh now you can see our table looks pretty similar to what it was looking like before okay but obviously something new we might want to do now is actually just increase the readability of this table okay so one thing that would make this table look a lot better is if we had a little bit of padding in between our cells so let's go padding of maybe 10 pixels okay and that's just going to add some space between the borders and the actual text within the cell so when I click refresh you can see we now have quite a lot of space around our actual wording over here and in fact that is probably too much so maybe 5 pixels will do so click refresh and okay that looks pretty cool but you know what this table is actually still kind of bland because there are a few more things that we can do to actually make this table a lot more readable and the first thing we can actually do is if we go back over to HTML there are a few more tags that we can actually add to this table now the first one is the table header tag so you might think ok th stands for table header but we can actually group all of these headers into one big table head by adding this tag over here called tea head and I'm going to actually just indent all of that and come back here and tea head okay so this stands for the table head then for the rest of our table we can actually include that all in the table body so in fact what I'm going to do is surround that's that entire row with the table head tag because that's actually just a lot better so just like that okay and then the rest of our our table can actually be the table body so tea oops man I am stuffing up ok caps lock off tea body okay and like I said that can be the rest of our table so we can end that off over there with tea body and there's actually one more tag that we can place in yeah and you guys probably guess what it is already but that is tea foot and that is the actual footer of our table and I don't really have anything to place in here so I'm probably just going to go ahead and say TR TR and we'll just say info well actually we have to put this in a table data tag and I'm going to give that a call span of four so call span equals four just so that it spans over all the rest of the columns in the table and I'm going to just say here info from info from Wikipedia just to give our actual table a Wikipedia hmm I guess I spelled it wrong but to give it an actual footer so you know if we go ahead and save this now that doesn't really change the look of our table just yet but we do have this extra footer in here now okay and what we can do now is use CSS to actually style those new tags that we put in into this table so for my tea head I could decide well hey I really want the header of this table to have a background color of some sort of blue but I can't think of a blue color at the moment so I'm going to give that a background color of H our hashtag CC DD EE and now my table head should have a background color of blue so when I come back and click refresh we've got this really light blue almost grey looking blue background over here then for our footer we could go ahead and give that a color as well so I'm going to go back to notepad and we'll go ahead and grab our footer so T foots and I could probably give that a background color of something else DD CCEE so kind of that thing just the opposite way around and this is going to make sort of a purpley pink very light color so now we have a different color for our table footer and we could actually Center this text as well by just going text-align:center and then that will be in the center and the last thing we can do is we could start our body and actually give our entire body a different color but I'm kind of fine having it as white but it would be nice if every second row in the table actually had a different color wouldn't that be nice so we can go back to notepad plus plus and maybe just above that table header just because I don't want to overwrite those style pools I'm going to put it above this though the the table header steel hitter the table header and I'm going to go ahead and grab the table row but I want to grab the enth child so I have a tutorial on the enth child selector already if you guys haven't seen that and I'm going to grab the second row of every tire or yeah every second row of the table and that's what that 2n means okay and we're just going to give that a different background color as well so background color and I'm going to give that a background color of AO AO AO and that is going to be a sort of gray color so when we save this now and come back to Firefox and click refresh you can see that every second row in our table has turned gray our foot is kind of like this pink color and our header is that blue color and we also Center the text and our foot a table or table cell okay so that is how you would style a type a table using a CSS and yeah that is all I have for you guys in this video so don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave
