hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and in this video I'm gonna talk to you guys about file pause in HTML so we've actually been making use of file parts for the past two tutorials I just didn't really explain them very well but this is the video this is the video where I explain what file parts are and I'm going to explain some technical terms when we use them so jump over to your text editor and you can see that right now I've got the exact same code as the previous tutorial actually this is an image that I added well it's not exactly the same I change the size and then I added a heading so if you take a look at this in the browser that's exactly what shows up a heading that says homepage and the image of me right so below that you can see I've also made a few notes to myself and these are notes that you guys should remember whenever working with your file path so by the way your file path is the name of the image in previous tutorials I told you guys just make sure that your image is in the same place as your index file or if the second page you're linking to or that you want to link to is in the same page same directory as your index file everything should be fine and you just copy and paste the name of that file right so that is fine when everything is in one folder when everything is not in one folder you've got to make use of of some of these rules now what I told you in the previous tutorials is spaces are generally not good try to avoid using them if you can because let's say I renamed this image to have spaces in it sometimes this works other times it does not it depends on the server and what version of PHP you're running but let's let's just remove these spaces and take a look at this in the browser okay right now it seems to be working but if I'm using PHP or something like that a lot of the time URLs get encoded so spaces actually need to be replaced with percent twenty so again let's remove that in place percent twenty in here and right now you can see it is it's winter percent twenty which technically means space me percent twenty which again technically means space small save this now come back to the browser hit refresh check it's still working because that percent twenty represents a space but generally try not to use spaces if you don't want to have to deal with using weird characters like this like the percent twenty so let me rename this back to how I had it which was winter - me - small I'm going to have to do the same thing in my finder okay so that is just spaces done and talked about let's move on to the next point which is relative file paths versus absolute file paths so whenever you are linking to something you could take the absolute URL or you could use something called a relative file URL so absolute the absolute URL of my index file should actually be in the browser it would be localhost 888 slash index dot HTML that would link to this HTML page that is the absolute URL so if I ever wanted to link to this this file I could just copy/paste that absolute URL paste it in wherever I needed it to be like that and that is an absolute URL appearing that wouldn't work for an image unfortunately so let's let's actually grab the images absolute URL which in this case would be localhost:8080 to date that backslash and then winter - me - oh is that winter me small JPEG okay dot jpg and you can see that that opens up the image in my browser so that is the absolute URL for our image if I copy that and paste that over here save this maybe just go back in the browser to the index file and now you can see my image still shows up even though we've got this long absolute URL over here so you can make use of absolute URLs if you want to it's just a little bit of a pain if I move this website from my local host to WWE and watch comm I then have to go and change all of these URLs - to match that Quinton what com right so I'd have to go and change all of the URLs everywhere on my site to match the new URL and so that's why I don't really like using absolute URLs because if you move your site things break then let's take a look at what a relative URL or a relative file path is and that's basically what we've been doing this whole time whenever I said just type the name of the image like we have the name of the image over here we linked to the image with a relative URL so let me save this how let me refresh this in the browser now that it's safe and you can see the image still works because I'm using a relative URL and it is the correct URL but relative URLs can get a little bit tricky because what happens if I start placing my image in different places right now my image and my index file are in the same folder but that's not how we do things in the real world in the real world we generally want to organize stuff right so let's create a new folder here I'm going to call it images and this is what we usually do is we take all of our images and place them in an images folder but now if I go back here you can see the image is no longer here right so let me well I'm saving it but I don't actually need to come back to the browser hit refresh and now the image is not showing up that's because the browser is looking for a file called winter me small JPEG but it's looking for that file in the exact same place as our index.html file and if you look at this there is no file called winter me small here that that image is gone so now we need to tell the browser that the image isn't here anymore it's actually in a folder called images right so to do that we're going to make use of this last rule down here which is file name slash means look in that folder right so to tell the browser to look for this image in the images folder we're just going to add the file name which is images slash right and that tells the browser okay relative to where this index file is there should be a folder called images and it's there inside this folder called images we should have a picture called winter me small dot jpg and well there it is so let's come back to the browser and hit refresh and the image is now showing up right so that is relative from the index file but you might not always have this this might not always be the case you sometimes you might have to go back to the root directory or back one folder and you can see I've made these two notes over here forward slash at the beginning of the file path means go back to the root directory and then two periods and a slash means go back one folder so let's take a look at an example love that I'm going to create a new folder here I'm going to call it pages and I'm going to copy my index file paste it in the pages folder that's let's name it something like page and then I'm good well page page one page - one so now I'm going to open this in my text editor okay right now it has the same code as as my home page so let's let's change this that the title of the page can be page one and I'll get rid of my notes because I have those on the home page but I'm still going to use the same image just because I think it's easy to see if you want to practice this at home just practice it with with an image because it's the easiest thing to check with so now let's go over to page one by typing the full URL of page one in the URL bar which in this case would be localhost 888 slash pages because it's it's in this pages directory slash page - 1 dot HTML and that will take me to page 1 right now you can see the image on page 1 the code for the image is here but the image isn't showing up because it's broken right and that is because the file path is incorrect right now we're looking for a folder called images within the same directory as page 1 dot HTML so if I look at that page 1 dot HTML is here there is no folder called images here but if I go back one folder there is a folder called images so let me tell the browser to go back one folder and to do that if I look at my notes over here that was dot dot slash right so dot dot slash goes back one folder save that come back over to the browser and hit refresh BAM our image works right because we said go back one folder then find the images folder and then you will find your image so from from our page one back one folder images and there's the image so it works then there is the other notes that I have over here which is going back to the root directory so this is something that if you didn't set your website up on map then it's not going to work but if you followed me and you used mam and you now use map to simulate a server environment map then tells the browser that our root directory is this htdocs folder so htdocs is always going to be our root directory which means that if I ever wanted to go back to the root directory and look for something I simply need to have a forward slash or is that a back slash not sure which one I just need to have this slash at the beginning of our URL so that means go back to htdocs in htdocs' you will find a folder called images and then you will find in that folder called images the picture so let's let me save that and take a look at it in the browser and as you can see the image is still working so this file path is good as well and that's because we're going back to the root directory when looking for our image so I know that this can be confusing like I know that you're probably wondering like what the heck is all these slashes and dot dot slashes you know therefore but I did kind of explain it just practice and yeah when you get the hang of it you'll you'll you'll start to understand like because this is something that you're gonna use everywhere on the web whenever you link to a video whenever you link to an image whenever you link to an audio file another CSS file another page on your website you're going to have to make use of a file path whether it be a relative file path or an absolute file path and just the more you practice this the better you'll get I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me out on patreon you can also check me out on social media I will leave the links next to me so go ahead and click on something and I'll see you guys next time
