what is up guys it is confit here and I'm coming back with a brand new csgo video and today what we're gonna be looking at is how to get symbols and your name tags on any of your guns so what you want to do is you want to go to inventory and then you want to buy a nametag first of the two dollars each they're pretty cheap and then you need a gun you can put the name tag on so for this video I'm going to be using my ak-47 Vulcan and what you want to do is you want to right click on the name thing use name tag and then select the gun you want and now I can do select item and basically I'm gonna leave a chart of a bunch of symbol codes in my description and I'm gonna show you guys how to even put them here so first one I want to show you guys how to do is a copyright sign so I'm gonna do and then a copyright sign it's an hashtag 169 semicolon so you just click using the entitle to view it and then it shows up with this little copyright sign here so I'm not gonna show you guys I don't one so show you guys how to do this star one and for the star one it's a how one zero zero two six and then semicolon you gotta remember this semicolon because if you don't have a semicolon it doesn't register the symbol so I tried officer Mike one and you see it won't show up but if I do it with the semicolon so I do at No 1 to 0 to 6 then like one good thing see it'll show up as a star and you can do multiple symbols so let's see like the nuclear so I do you see you can see on two simple shot but this does use up your amount of characters so you need to have your name type quite short but nice day today this one so I'm going to finalize my thing and then and or end and then actually I'm gonna do it for so maybe like a pound and then pound and then nine seven or five and then I'm gonna some again and then you see it'll have like the check mark for rect and I'm gonna use this name so quick to use name and now my ak-47 Vulcan is no checkmark correct we see on the skin it shows up as numbers but that's just on the skin otherwise I everything will be fine anything you use this for any skin and for any name symbol and no you cannot get back the end for this and it goes you don't worry but it'll be kind of cool to see people's reactions in game to you having weird skin like this otherwise that's all I got see you later
