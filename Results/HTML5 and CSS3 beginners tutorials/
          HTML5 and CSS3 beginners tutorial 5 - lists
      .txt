hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number five and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at making lists in HTML so as you can see I've cleared out everything in the body and I've changed the title of my website a little bit just so that it says what we're doing in this tutorial okay but other than that this is the basic templates that we set up in tutorial two so you can go ahead and just do the exact same thing to follow along now there are actually two different possible types of Lists that we can make in HTML and the first type of Lists that I want to show you guys is called an unordered list in other words the lists all have a bullet point next to them so they don't have to appear in any particular order okay so they're not ordered in any way it's just bullet points and to do that you're going to go ahead and put in the tags ul which stands for unordered list okay and then we're going to end off our an ordered list and in between here is where all of our list items have to go or all of the points that we want in our list have to go okay and I kind of already gave you a hint as to what we call those okay because each item in a list is called a list item so we go ahead and we start that off with the tag li4 list item and we end it off with an ending li okay so I'm actually just going to copy this and now we can think of things that we have to put in our list so let's say this was a list for Santa Claus and we wanted to tell him things that we want for Christmas that he should probably bring for us because let's face it Santa's real you know so the first thing that I would like from Santa is more books to make tutorials for you guys okay and then the next thing that I think I'd like is a new keyboard because this one has a really small shift key on the left side and usually the shift key on the left sides big but I didn't actually see that when I bought it and I couldn't send it back so I have to deal with it now a small shift key okay then the third thing I think I want from Santa is battlefield for the game because I like the game so God put that in there and the next one I guess can be a game as well so I'll go ahead and say Assassin's Creed Black Flag because I do not have that yet and it's the only one I don't have already bought all the others okay so if we go ahead and we save this now and then we run this in Firefox you can see we've got a list on our page and each item has a bullet point next to it so they're not ordered in any way we could change these around and if it still makes sense because they just got bullet bulleted items okay and the next kind of list that I wanted to show you guys was is called an ordered list and these would be lists that have to be in order so let's say I was going to make a list of steps that you guys have to take to become good programmers or write good websites okay then I have to go ahead and start off my list with the tag Oh L and this stands for ordered list and then we're going to end it off with the ending Oh L and in here we're still going to use the same list item tags so the type of list that gets displayed depends on the outer tag that Oh L or the UL tag but the list item tags are common in both lists okay so let's say the first step to becoming a good programmer is to go to the programmers Creed YouTube channel okay and the second step would be to subscribe subscribe okay and the third point we could probably say watch all the videos because otherwise you're not going to learn anything if you don't watch them and the last line would be practice because you guys have to practice these things yourself to get good at them so practice practice practice okay so now when we go ahead and we save this and come back to Firefox again and click refresh you can see we've got the two lists on our page and you remember this was the unordered list and this is our ordered list so it's actually numbered 1 2 3 4 so our steps or the items in this list have to be in an order that makes sense obviously otherwise people are going to read this and go like what the heck how can I do point number 2 if I haven't even done point number 1 Who am I supposed to subscribe to so that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this video thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow so thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time
