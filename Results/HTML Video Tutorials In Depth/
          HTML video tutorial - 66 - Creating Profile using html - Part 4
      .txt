hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I minimize it right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad we are learning how to create our own profile using HTML in this tutorial I am going to discuss about coloring we are going to color this properly first I set this background color let's see what happens if I apply the background color I select this and I select this okay I'm using the eyedropper tool I click on this area it fills the color as a foreground color and this is the value 28 28 28 is the hexadecimal value I copy it from here and I go to the notepad I set the body BG color BG c bo L war background color and I say here hash and I paste it 28 28 28 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the background color is set and also it is applied to all other contents to the table also same background color you should understand this flow of styling to the children's how it works now I am going to set the background color for the table itself because I don't like the gray color as a background color for the table to set the background color for the table I go to the table tag and there I am going to say BG SIBO L war a background color let me set hash FF FF FF that is going to be a white color file save good browser and say refresh ok this is how it looks now next what I do I am going to set the background color for this pot this area this row ok I am going to set this color only whatever the background color of this image I have I am gonna set that how do we get that information means I am going to use the eyedropper tool click somewhere and hold the mouse left button down I don't let go I go here to the image and I let go the mouse left mouse button you'll see that the color is filled in the foreground now I can take that foreground color information Here I am going to copy this hexadecimal value I copy this and use that in notepad I go to notepad and I set the background color of this row the table row which I have here which has picture and some information I set the BG see vuelvo our background color to that and I put hash symbol here file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks guys next what I do I am going to set the background color for this my profile row and a homepage row so to set that I am going to select the color which matches maybe let me select the hue and select the color from this side maybe I select this color I copy this hexadecimal value from here and I use that in notepad I go here to this table row I am going to set BGC vuelvo our background color hash control V file save go to browser and refresh you can see it looks something like this similarly I am going to apply the background color to this homepage row I go to homepage row where is it let me check out here we have that row and here I am going to say BGC bow elbow are a background color I said this I put here hash file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks guys next same color I am going to apply to this footer so I go to footer here we have that row here I'm going to say BG Civil War background color hash control V double quotations file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks guys now then I'm going to set the background color for this navigation bar which is going to be the same color that I have for this row let me go here I copy the background color of this row and not that row this row I am going to copy and I use that for navigation TD where is the navigation TD available the navigation TD is available here this is the navigation table data cell to that I am going to apply the background color this file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now we are making proper coloring I'm not going to apply any background color for the main content at present only this much I am going to put so hope you guys are understanding how we can apply the color and then here instead of footer I am going to write some content here instead of footer I am going to write C opy righ T copyright file save go to browser and refresh so I have written here copyright sometimes people will show here the copyright symbol to display the copyright symbol we are going to use HTML entities HTML entities starts with the ampersand then there will be named to every HTML character entity so I am going to use your copy then semicolon now ampersand copy semicolon what it does means it displays the copyright symbol file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a copyright symbol there are HTML entities or character entities which start with ampersand you can search for list of HTML character entity is online you will get so many character and if you are working with different languages you can use the character entities like Chinese Japanese different types of characters you want to display on your web page then you need to take a help of character entities I discuss about them later in upcoming video tutorials and also you can see if I want to set some space here for each anchor tag if I want to give some space and move the content a little bit right I cannot do that because if I enter as many spaces I want I can enter but ctrl save if i refresh there will be no effect because we know that more than one spaces are going to be collapsed to a single space that we have learned in the beginning tutorials if you want really want to give some spacers like this then you have to use the HTML entity and nbsp semicolon and this is going to give a non-breakable space character it is going to add a non-breakable space character I can copy this and paste it some two three four times let's take and let's see what happens to the home page hyperlink file save go to browser and refresh you can see that our home hyperlink is moved a little bit forward can you see that so we can decide how many spaces we want at present I put only two non-breakable spaces file save go to browser and refresh that looks good similarly I am going to copy this non-breakable spaces to non-breakable spaces copy them and paste it down for every hyperlink control V control V control V control V control V control V control V file save go to browser and refresh this is how it looks guys and also I need to add for contact me I think I forgot it let's go down and paste here file save go to browser and refresh in our my profile website for every page this is going to become lay out guys so hope you guys have understood how you can you can apply color how you can use the HTML entities I suggest you
