hello everyone when welcome to the second lecture on HTML which is a part of every engineering course so in this video we are going to see about HTML tags some of the very basic text that are present in every HTML page now HTML tag contains three main parts or an HTML contains three main parts first is opening tag so the opening tag then the content which is present inside the tag and finally we have the closing tag to kissy be HTML take a theme main part of the opening tag content within the deck or closing tag although syntax of the basic syntax both a take a name then the content and the closing tag so age you have Calle have opening tag this is the content and this is your closing tag closing tag knows difference cos x / o pencil the for example Aramaic now HTML the opening tag oh yeah yeah Patrick which contain toga or fury Schaick closing tag oppa please tourism HTML key tag slick thing I think which is what the other common to tags use of them HTML mean one comic look about them sub Savelle a doctype this text defines the document type and HTML version so basically it is used for defining the document type this type a document HTML a CSS a K and HTML version concept ml version copy a dose could be defined kirpan it tells the documentation a pipe or a webpage second is HTML now this tag encloses the complete HTML document so it contains the complete HTML document HTML page it's Texas uo type or AC tech say cut the motor or risky B to enjoy the pra√ßa webpage with them it is that is your HTML then we have the head tag it is actually the documents header document a header a and it keeps other text like title link etc it's my couch over tag so things just a title tag link tag and a graph is for search engine optimization key so they give me the year takes up so important again to key is see tech in the Ramapo name meta keywords meta description kobe ad campaign so meta tags like meta keywords meta description also goes in the head tag then we have the title this is the tag which is used inside the head tag and it is used to mention the document title apodaca see web page copan guru get through Purdue status put the title bar OTA what's meant addictive home title taken the define car thing then we have the body body is actually the content of the web page Jovie web page up display caruso sir content a book body taken the whole time and it contains other tags like heading tags ba this is the for bold then P tag and so on both are a orbit XO salesman the income of the same open HTML page cook constructor L thing then we have heading tags these tags are from h1 to h6 and it represents the heading you see a heading at risk of my h1 Tech in the lagoon why I say h1 HTML tags so you're heading away or a Jumeirah hey Karim a right paragraph ah--this khmer but i could have taken the enclose careful so it is used to make the distinct distinction between a heading and the content of the web page P is for paragraph the normal takes up choker to paragraph banana kill him P tech I use captain so this is about the tags in HTML thank you for watching the video please subscribe to my youtube channel for more tutorials on web engineering and other computers and related subjects think
