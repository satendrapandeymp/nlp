hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series let me right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad I minimize this let me right click once again on the first page dot HTML open with the Firefox in the previous tutorial we understood importance of attributes and we understood how align attribute helps to align heading text to the left to the center to the right of the browser window in this tutorial I am going to discuss font tag so I delete this content go to file save go to browser and refresh Here I am going to write some content hello HTML I go to file say save go to browser and refresh you can see that hello HTML got displayed now what I want actually is I want to increase the font size of this Hetch character now how do we do that if it is a WordPad in a WordPad I can write here hello HTML then I can select this hatch character I go to this font size drop-down box here I can select the different font size that I like too so maybe I select here 48 you can see that the edge character font size got increased similarly in HTML to do that I need to use the font tag font tag is a paid attack so just before this hatch character I am going to write opening font tag then after the hedge tag I am going to write closing font tag you can see that I have used the font tag if I say file save go to browser and refresh no change to increase the font size of this H character I need to use an ad called as sighs there is a attribute called as sighs with respect to the font tag so I need to write that here just before the greater than symbol after the font text I give a space then I write the attribute name size to assign a value I use equal to sign then I use pair of double quotations in between these two double quotations I need to write the font size here I give one then I go to file say save now what happens here when i refresh actually the font size of this each character is going to reduce let me show that if I click on refresh you can see that the H got reduced its size got reduced you can see that one indicates eight points that means here in WordPad if I select this and click on eight that is actually one in HTML so if I change this edge to ten that is going to be two so what I do here sighs I am going to change to to go to file save go to browser and refresh so you can see that the font size increased here I am going to increase the font size to 14 similarly to increase it to 14 I give here three file save go to browser refresh you can see that font size increased similarly I can increase the font size more 16 so here I am going to give for file save go to browser refresh now here I am going to change from 16 to 18 then I go here I change this to 5 go to file save go to browser refresh you can see that how the things are changing I select this edge character as changes to 20 then here I give 6 file save go to browser refresh here I change this edge character font size to be 22 then Here I am going to say seven file/save go to browser refresh you can see that the character sighs got increase in WordPad if I want I can increase the font size more also I can get go to 24 28 72 right but in HTML we cannot increase the font size more than 7 so if I give here 8 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the font size is not increasing Hetch character height is same no change so maximum value for the size attribute is 7 we cannot give more than that hope you guys have understood how to increase a font size of any character or a word now what I do I want to change the font style to change the font style in WordPad what we do we select the text then we go to font family here we can select any font you can see I can select this one you can see that the font style got changed this is called as font face I can change something else maybe I can select Arial black it looks like this I can change to something like monotype course IVA here you can see I have monotype course ey if I select the H character is going to look something like this so I can copy this from here ctrl C if I want to change the font style of this edge character I need to add a attribute to the font tag to add one more attribute I give a space then I write an attribute name called as face equal to pair of double quotations in between these two double quotations I am going to write the font face name monotype course IVA now what happens this edge character is displayed at the size 7 with the font style monotype course even if I go to file save go to browser and refresh you can see that H got displayed in different style similar if I want to change the color of a selected text I select the text here I go to text to color in this place then I select any color that I want to so you can see that H got displayed in a red color so what I do here I am going to add one more attribute called as color I give a space then I write the color attribute then I give a value in double quotations here I am going to use red I go to file save go to browser and refresh you can see that each got displayed in a red color so this is how we are going to use the font tag hope you guys are understanding how we use a font tag and change the size of the font change the font face apply the color to the selected text similarly let's take I want to change the font size font color and font face of this Hetch tml text what I need to do just before the H tag I am going to write font opening tag and font closing tag then what I do after this I am going to give size attribute equal to maybe I give 3 now I save the file go to browser and refresh check out that it is not changed much let me change this to 5 go to file save go to browser and refresh you can see that HTML text size is now 5 then I give a space here I'm going to apply the face so font face value I am going to give is Ariel so Ariel is a font face so go to file save go to browser and refresh check that out similarly I can apply the color I give a space right color attribute equal to value I am going to give is maybe green go to file save go to browser refresh you can see that the text color changed to green this is how you can
