how's it going everyone and welcome to a very short episode and something called file paths now as you can hear I'm still kind of sick so I have a really hard time for some reason pronouncing path when there's a th on the end with my voice being like this but hopefully I'll get through through this episode so a lot of you had questions when it came to the file path and I figured up just you a short episode covering this so when it comes to file paths we have two different types of links we have internal links where you can link to a file let's say I have a folder that's named folder and inside this folder I have something like a file so I can actually link to gallery dot HTML which could be a file and then we could do it in this way now we also have something called URL paths paths which can link to external websites if you want to and I went ahead and link to my YouTube channel here just to show an example so it's a very simple process if you want to do that now I'm just gonna go ahead and delete the URL path and instead we're gonna go and focus on file path the path this so right now you guys can see I just link to a file inside a folder and in order to do that we need to write the name of the folder which in this case I just said folder it could be includes if we had a folder called includes and we can do that by simply writing the name of the folder and then for words less mean that we're gonna go into that folder and then the name of the file you want to link to now if you want to go back a directory or pack a folder let's say I'm inside a folder called folder and I need to go back a directory and then go inside the includes folder then I can actually go and say dot dot for slash which means that we're gonna go back a directory before we start doing all this path thing going on here now there's a third thing we can actually do which is something that's not really considered best practice but you can do it which is if I just were to include a forward slash in front of my path here let's say I'm somewhere really really deep and complicated inside some weird directory deep down inside my website and I need to go all way back to you the main directory of my website where we have the index page then I can just write a forward slash which means that we are referring to the main directory inside the website and this is one thing that you guys have been asking me about because we can go back to the main directory and just simply link from there arriving forward slash but like I said it's not really bad best practices since in some cases it can sort of screw up your you're linking inside a website since we change the mains and that sort of things so but he can do it if you want to and if you have an example we can actually do it so this is what I want to say about file paths I hope to see you guys next time I'd like to say thank you to all the people supporting me on patreon advance to the next benefit such as lesson materials then go ahead and visit the link to do see on screen here and I'll see you guys next time [Music]
