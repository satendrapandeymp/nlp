all right how to create space between words and lines in HTML so notice at the bottom I have these words which actually appear as links but they were words first basically there's a series of characters that represents a space as if you were in word new types of space with the space bar between words this series of characters creates that for HTML which reads it as a space so here you hit the space bar I think 10 times that's how many series of these characters I have I'm just going to show you what they look like here in the code alright so that is the 10 spaces it's 10 of this little character series and in BSP that's what it is you're going to copy that and paste it that little character combination is many times for as many spaces as you want between words and you would just copy this and duplicate it or command V for for pasting and command C to copy obviously in between whichever other words in that series that you want to have equal just in space between so for me that's clear here here the same amount of spaces so that's between words if you want to create space between lines I'll just show you an example I'm going to click my cursor between goes and main content right there winded code there it is so I'm going to actually type this code in here a little bracket right there and then the characters BR and I'm going to type a right bracket and it's going to automatically put a space and then a slash for me for a break there you go so if I can jump back over to the design view and you see that goes here is jump down a lion space now if I want a space between these lines I will just copy that and do it again command C to copy command V to paste so there's two line breaks in a row and now I have that space between my lines very easy just to simple character combinations HTML codes basically to create space between words and lines in HTML doesn't matter that this is Dreamweaver it works anywhere HTML so there you go
