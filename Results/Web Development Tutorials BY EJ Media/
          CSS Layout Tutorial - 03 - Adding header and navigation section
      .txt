welcome to the third tutorial on CSS layouts so we are continuing right along from the last video and we are going to add the header and navigation bar sections and so let's start in the HTML of course and so what do we need we need a div tag of course to create those sections so let's do that and we're going to use IDs here instead of generic classes so we're just going to use an ID to identify this because this is going to be a unique section and we'll give it a relevant name we'll call this header and let's just go ahead and copy and paste this and then our next section is going to be the navigation bar and we're just going to call this nav one for navigation bar and we're not going to put any content in here right now we're just going to set up the layout later on we'll actually put some content in here we'll actually do a logo and stuff like that but for now we just want to get the layout set up first and actually you know let's call this navbar a little bit more representative so let's go ahead and we'll just copy and paste this here and we'll rename this to header and you'll remember from the CSS series that when we use IDs we need hash tags so let's put a hashtag in front of our header and we're going to go ahead and clear out these two rules and we're going to set the margin to 10 pixels so we'll have 10 pixels of margin space around our element and we're going to change the background color so we're going to override the color that we set in the body and again I already have the hex code available and it's going to be 5c 755 easy and let's give this a height of about 90 pixels and that's pretty standard you can up that if you want to 110 or if you want it a little bit bigger but we'll just say 90 pixels for the height and let's go ahead and save this and we also have to save our index.html and let's open this up and there you can see we have our first section and as I said again we'll put in our content here which will probably be a logo or something so that's good we've got that down and you can see we've got that 10 pixels going around here and remember the margin is always transparent so we will see the background color which of course we set to that army green color which we did in the last video okay so let's close that out and now let's create our navbar so we'll just do another copy and paste here and again we need the hashtag so we'll call this navbar and we're going to keep the same background color so we'll use that and actually we're going to keep the same margin so that will all be the same but we're going to reduce the height a little bit to 35 pixels so let's save this and we'll see what we have and now you can see we've got our navbar under our header and the reason this is going to be thinners because we're going to put buttons in here for our menu so we'll put a home button here and some other buttons and we'll do that later so we'll fill that in later but you can see we've got our layout going here and it's pretty good now you'll notice that we did not put in widths we're just going to put in a height property because we want this to be responsive we want this to be a liquid web site that is we want this to size accordingly to where the user has their browser set in terms of the size of their browser so as they minimize it or maximize it our elements will size accordingly so no width for our header or our navbar element we are merely just going to define a height and that works very nicely and again this fits into this liquid responsive website design that we want to do the other thing I want to point out is this 10 pixel margin now that we have around our elements and that is what you call a gutter people refer to that as a gutter and that's where you use the margins to separate the elements and it's kind of pleasing to the eyes so all the future elements that we add will have this little gutter around it and it's kind of nice to have so that these aren't crammed right up next to each other now if you don't want that you can remove the margins but I don't really think that looks too good I actually like to have this these gutters as they are called all around the elements so every other element we have will always have that 10 pixel margin space now some people are like the sort of rectangular look to have these edges pointed others want to put a radius so if you like the pointed edges you can keep that or you can add a little bit of radius I'm just going to add a little radius to this to show you guys what it looks like and we'll keep that but again if you don't want that you can just comment out the code that I'm going to put in so what we will do is use the border property and we will say border radius and we're going to curve it about five pixels that's standard you can make that lower if you want you could make that two point five pixels if you wanted to and let's just go ahead and copy and paste that into our navbar because we want all of our elements to have this so let's say this and there you can see now we have this nice five pixel radius around the corners of our header and our navigation bar so that's going to do it for this video in the next video we are going to add a main content pane
