hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 29 and in this tutorial I am going to show you guys how to you make rounded corners using css3 now I just want to mention that rounded corners are new to css3 so if you're using an outdated browser then something like Internet Explorer 8 or something like that probably isn't going to support these rounded corners but as long as your browser's up-to-date then this should work okay so if it doesn't work just go ahead and update your browser and the rounded corners will display okay now to save time what I've done is I've created a div on my web page and I've given that a class of rounded box and I've just written the word apples inside of that div okay and then I went ahead and I gave it some styling as well so I selected it by class which I've shown you guys how to do this before and I gave it a background color of orange I gave it a width of 200 pixels I set the text to be in the center and then I just gave it a padding of 50 pixels on the top and 50 pixels on the bottom and then padding of zero pixels on the right and zero pixels on the left and this is basically the output so we get the word apples in a big orange box okay now let's go ahead and actually use CSS to round off these corners because right now they're pretty sharp okay so all you have to do is go ahead and say order radius just like that so border - radius and then you'll go ahead and put in a value so I'm going to go ahead and just put in a value of five pixels and this is going to be very subtle you might not even be able to see this on my screen recorder or on YouTube but if I click refresh you can see that the corners change from being really sharp to a little bit rounded and if I went ahead and I just made this a lot bigger so let's go ahead and say something like 50 pixels you'll be able to see this a lot more clearly so if I go ahead now and click refresh you can see now the corner has really been rounded by quite a lot of space okay so that's basically how to round all of the corners but what happens if you decided well hey I'd really like only this corner to be rounded and then the rest of them to be sharp well then you can around only the top left by doing it this way so let's go ahead and just get rid of this and what we actually have to do here is type in border top left radius so that is going to round off the top left corner and we'll set that equal to 50 pixels and we'll leave the rest okay so now when we go over to Firefox and click refresh we've only rounded the top left corner of our box and again if I wanted to do this to the top right corner then I could just change the word right or the word left to right and if I go ahead now and click refresh then I've only rounded the right corner and if I wanted to do the bottom corners then I'd go ahead and just change bottom so I change top to bottom and we'd have a border bottom right radius and I didn't save that so let me just go ahead and click Save come back here click refresh and now we've rounded only the bottom right and again if I wanted to change this to the bottom left then I just change the right to lift and when I go ahead and click refresh then I've changed the bottom left radius as well okay so this does work in most browsers now but if you want to make make this kind of work in some older versions of Firefox or some some older versions of Chrome then they used to actually do something or used to use something called a WebKit so chrome used to use WebKit border-radius and that would make the rounded border appear rounded in an older version of chrome okay but like I said the newer version actually supports it without the WebKit so you can go ahead and do that and it'll work in the new version of chrome just fine but if you're using an older version of Chrome go ahead and just include that word WebKit and I think that handles Safari as well and then if you wanted to make this work in an older version of Firefox then you'd have to include Mars but then I think some of this stuff actually has to change as well so it would have to be bottom right radius I I can't remember but that's just if it's if it's really old you can make use of those web kits all those will render is just like that but like I said this standard version like this should work in most of the new browsers nowadays so that's actually all I have for you guys in this video and thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
