hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss introduction to html5 so far whatever tags and attributes we have learnt almost all of them belong to HTML 4 and almost all of them are allowed to use in html5 document then what is html5 html5 is a latest specification of HTML we know that hTML is designed by Tim berners-lee in 1991 and HTML is maintained by w3c stands for World Wide Web Consortium from 1991 to 1999 many HTML specifications were released by w3c from HTML one to HTML 4 as I told whatever tags and attributes we have learned so far they are all belong to HTML 4 in 2004 what wag web hypertext application technology working group a group of web experts started observations on how web designers or developers are developing websites they observed patterns of using tags patterns of using attribute Styles classes values ID values by the web designers or web developers based on the observations in 2008 what wag released first public working draft this specification defines new features new tags and new attributes added to the HTML it provided list of remove tags list of deprecated tags and attributes in fifth version of HTML we know that in modern HTML everything should be syntactically and semantically meaningful to web designers our developers and user agents that is users and user agents user agents means browsers users means here web designers and developers any web page that you create it should be syntactically and semantically meaningful to everyone I hope you guys remember that we have created different layouts of web pages you can see here we created this is one layout this is another layout this is another layout all these layouts we created by using div tag right here we have a source code for first layout this is the source code for I can lay out this is the source code for third layout and if you observe carefully for creating every section we use read of only any section I need to create we use to create a div write to create a header section we used div tab to create a navigation section we used div tag to create main content section we used a div tag to create a footer we used a div tag we know that div is a generic container tag it is used to create sections in web pages of course in HTML 4 to create all these sections we used to use div tag as I told that web experts started observing how people are using different HTML tags attributes and values to the IDs they observed that people are using header value most commonly for ID attribute of a header section they observed that most commonly all over the world web designers are using footer value for an ID attribute of a footer Division so what they have done is they created tags for example to create a header section in html5 we use a header tag to create a footer section we use a footer tag in html5 to create a navigation section we use nav tag to create any generic section we use section tag to create any sidebars we use a site tag in HTML 4 to create a header section nav section footer section sidebar for all of the sections we used to use div tag in HTML 5 now we have some common tags that we can use for creating some specific sections of course you can see here to identify the header division here I have used the header as a value if you come to this layout here I have used head value as a ID attribute just imagine all over the world what are the values web designers might be using some might be using headings some might be using header some might be using header divisions a might be using head section like that there was no common s in HTML for web pages it is difficult to identify the divisions by different web designers or web browsers and also you can see to identify the wrapper I have used a container whereas here I have used the wrapper here I have used main container as a value of ID attribute for wrapper division just imagine all over the world people might be using different different values right that is not a common thing to identify html5 documents syntactically common they created specific tags in modern html5 documents to create header section we use header tag only every web designer or a developer uses header tag only every web designer or a web developer uses the footer tag only to create a footer section instead of div tag and using the ID attribute and giving some value also in html5 many new tags are added which are related to web applications like audio and video tags to control the audio and video applications canvas tag for 2d rendering you can see here some Lister list of deprecated tags I have listed here like bold italic u these tags are recommended not to use in html5 documents because they are deprecated either of them we can use CSS styles to make a text bold we can use CSS font weight property hope you guys are understanding what is the purpose of html5 and what is html5 html5 is the latest revision or latest a specification of HTML in 2014 html5 is released as a stable w3c recommendation html5 emphasizes on creating web pages and web applications which are syntactically and semantically consistent and meaningful to users as well as user agent that is web designers and web developers I hope you guys have understood what is the purpose of html5 Anna what is html5 for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next
