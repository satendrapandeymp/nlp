hey youtuber how's it going hits Clinton here and welcome to tutorial number 37 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to create forms using HTML and CSS so just a little disclaimer over here because we only know HTML and CSS and because this is an only and HTML and CSS tutorial series all we are going to be doing that the forms is learning how to place a form into our browser and then basically how to make it look pretty with CSS make it look a little bit better I am NOT going to be showing you guys how to send emails or store the information that gets folded in this form into a database because to do all of that stuff you need to know PHP or a little bit of JavaScript so you're going to need to know one of the two in fact if you want to store stuff in a database you're going to have to know PHP end of story no JavaScript allowed alright so yeah basically once you're finished with the series move on to PHP if that's something you want to learn how to do if that's not something you want to learn how to do and you only want to be a front-end web designer or a front-end web developer then you don't have to worry too much about that but I just thought I'd start off with that disclaimer so that you guys all know that you need to move to JavaScript or the PHP when you're done with the series right so now let's take a look at how to create forms so you can see I've gone ahead and cleared out pretty much all of the code in my body and we're starting off with like the same template that we've been using for the past couple tutorials or at least some of the earlier tutorials with the addition of the style sheet to a google font which I could probably have probably have removed for awhile now anyway now let's take a look at how to create a form so in HTML whenever you want to add a form to your website you type the word form and that opens up a form tag right if you using sublime you can just hit enter and it'll autocomplete for you and that's awesome so we have a form on our website this doesn't actually look like anything if you save this now and come the browser does nothing actually happens it doesn't show anything up right and part of that is because the form is just kind of the outside container is still a lot of stuff that we need place in here but there is some missing information that I want to talk to you guys about which goes in the opening form tag and that missing information is an action so every form needs an action and every form needs a method right so these are two attributes that we need to take care of right so an action is basically a place where you want to send the information that gets filled in in this form now right now we don't know PHP or JavaScript I'm just assuming all right so basically what you would do here is put like the name of another page PHP and hopefully it's a dot PHP or a dot JavaScript file or something so you can actually manage the data that gets sent through this form and do something with it but for now because we don't know HTML I mean we don't have no PHP or JavaScript I'm just going to leave this one blank right so just leave a blank and you can still learn how to create forms but we're not going to be sending the data anywhere just yet all right then the next thing is a method so a method I'm going to explain to you guys you basically have two options here you either have get or you have post right so if you're using yet basically what happens is if you ever take a look at the browser after submitting a form using a get variable you'll see an extra question mark added to the URL with variable names like var is equal to 12 and then something like ampersand name is equal to Quinton that kind of stuff so you'll see these these sorts of things added to the end of your URL of your website and that's basically what happens whenever you use the get method is it just sends the variables or any information that's in this form through the URL which obviously isn't very secure especially if you're working with passwords you'll be able to see the person's password up here so that is why we have the post method and basically the post method is a lot more secure at Hydra data away from people or prying eyes so it won't be up here in the URL and also you can send a lot more stuff right because if you're using the get method your URL is going to be like you know really really long whereas if you're using the post method if you have a long form it's easier to send more data through right okay so that is your action and your method right now let's take a look at some elements that go within our form and I want to introduce you to three elements today right so well it's actually one element with three different types so basically go ahead and type in input and that is an input tag which will typically go within a form so let's go ahead and hit enter on this input tag and you can see by default sublime gave me a type and a name right because all input elements if you're sending this data through to somewhere you're going to need a type for display purposes and then a name to manage whatever got fold in here right so let's go ahead with type of text and you'll notice that even if you don't fill in text text is the default so basically whether you fill in texture or not this first element is going to look completely the same either way right then name basically this is the name that you give to your elements whenever you want to manage whatever data got filled in here so I'm just going to give this a value of name right and this just means that later on in PHP if we want to find out what the user typed in here will refer to this as name right and I want to add one more attribute in here which is placeholder and placeholders are new to html5 although html5 has been around for quite a while now and basically a placeholder allows you to type something in here like your name and whatever you put within these quotation marks is what's going to appear as a placeholder in the element so let's come back here to the browser and refresh and now you can see I have an input element over here but maybe let's just zoom in a little to make that a little bit more visible to you guys all right so we have a value over here that's already filled in which is your name right and yeah basically when you click on that you can type in your name right and that's basically all this form allows us to do right now so let's go ahead and add in a few more fields so something else we can do is copy this one down and then change the type from text to password and then we'll change the name of this to password and then we'll change the placeholder of this to your password right so now if you save this and you jump back over to the browser and refresh you now have fields for a name and a field for a password and the placeholders are showing up just letting you know that you can fill in a name here and a password yeah right so if you go ahead and fill something like this in you'll notice that password whenever you type here it will hide away the characters so you get these like bullet points so it's just encrypted which is what you'd expect from a password right if you were using a value like text for a password or if you just didn't fill in a type for this password basically what would happen is yeah you type something in like your name over here and then password would be the visible to the user and that kind of sucks you don't really want the password to be visible like that so you want to change that to have a type of password just so that the browser hides it away right and then the last input element I want to talk to you guys about is an input element that we're going to have to have on every single form we have a create and the reason for that is because it is going to be the submit button so you can get rid of placeholder because we're not going to need a placeholder here and then you want to change the type to submit so type is equal to submit name I'd say for a submit button you don't have to worry about giving it a name but you do want to give it a value and the reason why you want to give it a value is because whatever you place within the value is going to be what appears on the button right so if you type send over here then you'll have a button that says send if you type submit over here you'll have a button that says submit so let's save this come back over to the browser and refresh and now you can see I've got a submit button over here and it says send but like I said whatever I type in the value over here like submit that is what's going to show up on the actual submit button now you'll notice that right now all of these fields appear next to each other and you might want them to be one below the other so sometimes you'll see people do this with a form they'll add line breaks after each element so if we save this now and come back over the browser and hit refresh they appear one below the other right other times you'll see people surround them in paragraph tags whoopsie okay let's just get rid of that and start this from the beginning except paragraph and then your input element right and then ending paragraph and they'll do this with each one of the elements so yeah kind of time-consuming to go through this whole process but nevertheless I will get it done right so sometimes people surround the elements with paragraphs like that and it does assemble a sort of effect except it gives a little bit of spacing right and other times instead of using paragraphs people will just use divs or something like that so basically just keep in mind that if you want to create a specific layout for your elements on your page if you want them to appear one below the other or something like that you can always add in other HTML around these elements so let's hit save come back over to the browser refresh and there we go that's what it looks like right so you'll notice that if you fall all of this in now and you hit submit it basically refreshes the page and that's because the action is set to a blank file instead of another files name and just so you can see the difference between what happens if this is blank and if there's something folding over here let's just say this was set to something like login dot PHP just because we have a text field applause and a username and a password field all right save this now and jump back over to the browser hit refresh oops okay let's just refresh this way right if you fill in information and then hit submit you can see we've got a not found error the requested URL login dot PHP was not found on the server if you take a look at the URL up here it's also set to login dot PHP so basically it what happened here is if I go to my htdocs folder if I had another file here called login dot PHP we would have gone through to that file but since this is this file doesn't exist it says not found right but you can always create that file and send the data through to that and it will submit through to that page so just as a as an example of again let's jump back over to htdocs let's copy this and then paste it again index copy dot HTML let's change this to login dot PHP alright and we'll use the PHP extension drag that hangs up TextEdit over here and then we'll just say let's create a heading here and say file not file but data submitted sub committed alright okay save this now okay and let's try this again because now we have login dot PHP here it actually exists so let's hit submit and you can see that that has taken us through to the login dot PHP page and we know we're there because we added this heading of data submitted to this page and that's what shows up over here right so yeah right now this PHP file doesn't actually do anything because like I said we don't know PHP just yet but yeah that's exactly how this works and now that you guys know all of that I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev mountains they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to
