hey everyone college Ehsan here with another video in today's video I want to talk to you guys about two of my favorite books for beginners getting into web development so a little personal side note I actually started with my first book in web development it was called the fundamentals of HTML CSS in JavaScript by author named John Duquette this was about five years ago so the books a little bit outdated and the two book suggestions that I have for beginners are actually by the same author so beginning HTML and CSS by John Duquette is I think the best HTML and CSS book that you can get your hands on the reason why is all the examples in this book are extremely visual and you see exactly what would be represented in your browser on the pages and he walks you through each example and very plain and easy to digest language so I took a couple shots of the book just so you guys can see exactly what I was talking about about how visual it is so in this example I believe John is explaining how to float images within text containers that have text and as you can see it looks exactly the way the results that you would get in your browser are so just to reiterate again this book is very good at showing you exactly how things would look when you're testing out and going through the code examples in text so another reason why I really enjoy this book is because John touches a little bit on design theory as well so there's sections on typography for the web as well as color and ever so briefly layout as well and I mean layout Theory not just strict layout with markup and and floats and tables and things like that so he also takes a second to go over CSS grids and this is something that's really important in today's design and today's web development well there's a big stress on multi platform and multi device and different browser compatibility so learning how to lay things out with a grid system and create your own grid system in CSS is really important and this book does a really awesome job of kind of showing you examples of multi column grids and teaching you exactly how to do them so if you pick this thing up you'll know exactly how to roll your own grid similar to skeleton or bootstrap and don't worry guys I'm going a very simple beginners tutorial on making a CSS grid so make sure you guys subscribe to get that video now after you've learned HTML and CSS and you're all good with markup and kind of static sites and you want to add some interaction and some dynamic net to your sites you're going to want to go with John Duckett's book on JavaScript and jQuery like I said when I first started he actually had this in one book so he had a HTML CSS and JavaScript book but as of the latest editions of these books he split them up into two one focusing on HTML and CSS and one focusing on JavaScript and jQuery similarly to his HTML and CSS book in his JavaScript and jQuery book John does not give up on his very visual explanations so right here you can see that you are learning about JavaScript objects but he has these nice clear tables with all the properties in them and he has you know a visual picture representing the objects in the background um not only is this just a really good way to learn objects in programming and and modeling them after real world entities but again it's just the visual nature of these books I feel really lends to learning these concepts that are new for beginners something else that's really awesome about this book in particular is that's a little different from a lot of beginner javascript books is that John really stresses your approach in the way that you think about a problem before you tackle it in this one which is really interesting especially when thinking about a language that is so powerful that you're going to be doing a lot of different things with on the web it's important to really not not only learn the syntax and how to do things but also to think about problems that execute them and I think this book does a really good job of doing that again these are my two favorite beginner web development books I'm going to be doing more videos like this and as well as more book reviews on design books as well as some more advanced javascript and jquery books so stick around for those I'll have a link to where you can get both of these books as well as them as a bundle in the description below if you like that video and you'd like to see some more book recommendations by me forget I'm also going to be doing free online resources videos so subscribe to stick around for those these just happen to be two of my favorite books for anyone just getting into HTML CSS and JavaScript and one reason OneNote why I would like to say books are sometimes better than online resources is because one you can reference them whenever you want while maintaining whatever you're working on on your screen as well as books prevent you from doing the infamous copypasta sometimes when you're going through online tutorials you have the urge to just copy and paste them CSS especially when you get frustrated and things seem don't seem to be working but with a book you're kind of forced to go back and read through the examples so I think that's beneficial for someone who's a beginner and just getting started as always guys thanks for watching and I'll catch you guys in the next video
