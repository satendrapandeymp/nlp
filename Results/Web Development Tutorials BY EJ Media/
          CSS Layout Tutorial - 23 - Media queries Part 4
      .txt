okay this is going to be the final video on CSS media queries but I wanted to cover a couple of more things that you can do in CSS media queries now we're going to use the code that we used two lectures ago and part two of media queries so basically in the last lecture we added a different style sheet in this lecture again we're just going to go ahead and use the code that we used right before that lecture and you will remember that we added two media queries one to handle a 600 pixel resolution and another one to handle this 400 pixel resolution and let's just make sure that is still working so let's go ahead and minimize our browser there you can see yes both are working just fine good so let's go back to the code now you might ask well what if I only want to display this for mobile phones and tablets what if I don't want this situation to occur with the desktop browser what if I only want to apply this to mobile phones well we can actually specify a device type and it's very very simple actually we only need two keywords and we're going to add it right after media so we put in here only screen and what this means is basically only display this for mobile devices so this will only get applied now for mobile devices and so basically any user that is on a desktop PC and is browsing your website they will not be affected by these media queries so let's go ahead and we'll place this down here as well and let's go ahead and save our page and let's go back to our browser and we will refresh our page and then let's minimize this now if this works none of those media queries should be applied we should see absolutely no changes here and look it worked nothing was applied so I don't have a mobile phone here obviously to test this but basically if you wanted to load this page up on a mobile phone it should only display those resolutions so that's the way that works you can do it strictly by device all right let's minimize this now there is one final thing I would like to show you and basically what you can do is you can specify a range so you could say hey between 300 and 600 pixels I want to go ahead and rearrange the page or alter the elements and you can seht arranged now what we're going to do here is I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste it because I have this all typed out I just don't feel like typing it out again so we're just going to go ahead and get rid of all of our media queries and then I'm just going to copy and paste everything into here and here it is take a look now what we're doing is we're specifying a minimum width right here which is 400 pixels and then I'm using the and keyword and then I'm specifying a max width and so this gives you a range if you want to actually work between a specific range you can do that and then I just basically applied some of the same CSS rules we've been using in the previous lectures I got rid of the sidebar I got rid of the nav bar we're going to go ahead and float our logo to the left and we're going to make the background color of the Box dark red and so let's go ahead and save this and let's make sure it works now so we'll go back to our web page and we'll hit refresh and let's go ahead and I'm going to minimize this and watch what happens now watch what happens when we hit the 600 pixel mark okay there we just hit the 600 pixel mark and look the web page is back to its original form or so we're under 400 pixels and so media queries is no longer taking effect see how that works we had a little range there that's how that works okay that is going to do it for this video and as always I hope you found this useful thank you
