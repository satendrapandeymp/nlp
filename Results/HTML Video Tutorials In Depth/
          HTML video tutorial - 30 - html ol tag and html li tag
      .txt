hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series let me double click on the first page dot HTML right click on the first page dot HTML once again open with the notepad in the previous tutorial we discussed a mark you tagged in this tutorial I am going to discuss about lists in HTML we can create three different types of Lists they are ordered lists unordered lists and definition lists in this tutorial I am going to discuss order lists how do we create an ordered list how do we add list items to that order list you can see here I have a fresh HTML page there is nothing added except the structure here you can see the title it is showing is the file path I am going to give a title here o rder ordered list file save go to browser refresh you can see that the title changed to order list in the body tag I am going to add order list to add the order list or to create the order list we are going to use a tag called as oal tag oil tag is a paid tag and it is a block level tag as it is a paid tag I have to write an opening oil tag and a closing oil tag and it is a block level tag whatever the content you right after the o L will be moved to the next line that you should remember I hit enter give some tabs here we have an order list created there is no list item file save go to browser refresh you can see that no list item is there to add a list item to the order list we have to use a tag called as yell I tagged li tag is used to add the list items to any list Li tag is a paid tag so we have to have opening Li tag and a closing Li tag so here I write opening li tag and a closing li tag yell I tag is a a block level tag that also you should remember here I am going to add some information let's begin I am going to write f Rui TS fruits file save go to browser refresh you can see that to this order list we have added fruits one list item and you can see it has preceded by a decimal number one by default order list type is set to decimal number system so you will be having one if I add one more list item I copy this and paste it down and I say here maybe vegetables ve GI ta BL es vegetables file save go to browser refresh you can see that I have one more list item added to the order list then I copy this and paste it down and here I am going to mention may be vehicles file save go to browser refresh you can see that the order list is in a ascending order we have one two three like this we can add any number of list items automatically HTML generates a number for that list item file save and refresh you can see that here I am going to add a comment just for remembering purpose default type default F a ult default type is decimal de CI mal decimal I am going to copy this order list file save I'm going to paste it down you can see that I am creating one more ordered list this order list is going to be moved down here it is also going to have for list items file save go to browser refresh you can see that it also has one two three four here I can mention the type if I want to change so type I am going to give here one by default type is set to one if you do not say here type equal to one by default you can think like type equal to one is setup file save go to browser refresh no change right let me copy this ctrl C paste it down this time I am going to change the type to capital alphabets file save go to browser refresh you can see that this list is of type capital alphabet you can see that fruits is preceded by the capital letter A next be next to see next D similarly we can use small letters also control V type I am gonna set a file save go to browser refresh you can see that ABCD small letter ABC DS are displayed to list out the list items control V here I can use the Roman letters also I am going to use capital I file save go to browser refresh you can see that I am going to copy paste down I'm going to write here small I file save go to browser refresh now you are finding here small Roman letters right so these are the different types in which you can create ordered list in HTML by using the ordered list or oil tag also we have few more facilities with ordered list let me copy this order list and paste down I am creating one more order list here I am going to give one we know that this ordered list is going to be decimal each list item is going to have a decimal number in an ascending order one two three four like that so I am going to say file save go to browser refresh you can see that here we have one two three four we have a facility to add starting number s ta RT start equal to in double quotation I am going to mention four I am telling to the system that start this order list with four instead of one file save good browser refresh you can see that four five six seven right I can copy this and paste it down to create one more ordered list here I'm going to say capital a file save I am telling to the system create an ordered list of type capital letter a but you should start with the letter which is at the fourth position so D is that fourth position right so you are going to see d e f g file save go to browser refresh if you see here it has created an ordered list with the capital alphabets instead of a you have here d e f g hope you guys are understanding so in this tutorial we understood how do we create an order list how do we change the type of the order list and how do you set the starting of the ordered list number so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we discuss how do we create unordered list for more benefits please subscribe like
