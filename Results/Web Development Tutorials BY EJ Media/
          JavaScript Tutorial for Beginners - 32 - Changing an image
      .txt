in the last video we covered the innerhtml property and we were able to completely replace the text on our webpage in this video we're going to change an image using javascript and we're going to use the source property and of course in JavaScript it's SR C that's what we use to specify in our JavaScript and again it's a property just like innerhtml so let's pull up the code now you can see here we're using the same button as we always have the only difference is I've added an image now that we're going to change I just wanted to keep this up we use this some of this code from the last video this paragraph element and I just wanted to point out to you that the inner HTML of course was a property that worked against the content inside our paragraph element the source property works against the source attribute in the IMG tag and that will allow us to change this JPEG image to a different image so we don't need this anymore I just wanted to use this to make that point so what we're going to do again is when we hit this button we want this initial image of Stalin to change to an image of Lenin so again the source property just works against the source attribute and we've seen this many times when we've used images and of course the source attribute is part of the IMG tag now I want to pull up the folder that I'm using really quickly you can use any image you want I'm using these images of Lenin and Stalin if you go to Wikipedia if you want to use these exact images you can go to Wikipedia and search on Lenin and search on Stalin and you'll find these at the front of the webpage but again you want to place these images in your web folder that's what I'm doing here also make sure that you're using the right extension so if you're using a jpg you need jpg but if it's a jiff you need to make sure you put gif here if it's PNG you need to make sure you put PNG here and the way you can tell is you can just click on this and it says jpg right here and trust me that's throwing me off many times so again copy both of the images your two images to the web folder that will be executing this code out of okay so this is all good to go we've got our source attribute pointing to our stalin image that's the first image that we'll get loaded on our web page and we've created an ID we're using an ID here with the of image and so what does that mean we're going to be using to get element by ID method to grab this first so let's switch over to the JavaScript code and here you can see again we're using the get element by ID method of course that's going to grab our ID of image and then of course we get to use the source property which belongs to the document object right and what we can do is just flip that to lenin jbg it's actually very simple so we're just specifying SRC and then we're pointing to our new image so let's go ahead and run this and we'll see what we get here and if we hit the Change button there you can see we've got our new image so that's how you change an image you have to go against the source attribute and again you need to use the source property which of course is part of the document object model so let's flip back to our outline really quick so we just completed how to change an image now these three subjects right here we're actually going to hold off on because we're going to start looking at events so we'll come back to these subjects and later videos but like I said we want to start on the topic of events and there are several different types of events so in the next video we're going to talk about the onclick event yes we've been doing that in the last several videos so this should be very familiar to you and we're not only going to talk about the onclick event again we're going to talk about what events do and the different types of events and there are many other events will be covering over the next several videos see you guys in the next video
