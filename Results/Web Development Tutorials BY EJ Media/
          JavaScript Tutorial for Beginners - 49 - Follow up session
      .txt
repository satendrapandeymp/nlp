we're going to do a follow-up session to episode 31 and that's because I've been getting several questions about that video and a bug and I'll show you what happened so you remember in that episode we combined these two paragraphs right here to form one paragraph in one sentence that says hello there from the moon so let's go ahead and hit this and of course it worked like it did in episode 31 but if you hit the button again it disappears forever if you keep hitting it nothing ever comes back so what we'll do in this videos will do bug the code to find out what happened first because that's always important to know exactly where it went wrong and then we'll try to prevent that from happening so let's flip over to the JavaScript code and again this is all the same code from that video and let's refresh our page to get back to square one and then we'll step through the code now the first thing let's do is let's just see what we were doing here now you will remember that we use the get elements by class name to get of the paragraph elements and then we took this paragraph which had an index value of zero and then we took this paragraph which had an index value of 1 which is right here of course and then we combine these two paragraphs into this third paragraph which has an index value of 2 and then what we decided to do is hide these initial two paragraphs so we did that right here so let's go ahead and see if this all works and of course we know it does now where are we at well this code really wasn't designed to hit the button again but if we do in fact do that which we will let's see what happens well the codes going to come down here and there's really nothing to do right it's not gonna be able to combine paragraphs there's only one paragraph now so it'll skip all this code and then come down here now here's where things go wrong we're asking to hide this first paragraph or actually we're not really hiding it we're just making the text blank but in any event this paragraph that we combined during the first run no longer has this index value of 2 it has an index value of 0 so this code will work it'll hide this paragraph which now has this index value of 0 so let's hit this button and that's exactly what happened and now if we hit this button over and over again nothing will get executed in this function so that's the bug and let's refresh our page back normal so how to fix this well there are a number of strategies that we can do the thing we can do is simply hide the button so they can't hit it again so that's we're going to do in this video we're actually just going to hide this button to prevent them from doing that but first we need to give our button here an ID I don't think we did that a previous video so let's flip back here and yes this will need an ID remember we need to grab this in JavaScript and it's easier to do that with an ID so let's give this an ID and we'll just give this a name of test that should do just fine so we've got our ID set so let's flip back to our JavaScript code and we'll go down here and let's actually create some code to hide this button so what we're going to do is use one of our very favorite methods the get element by ID method and of course the ID that we're getting is test now the object we want to use is the style object remember that object that allows us to do CSS type things in JavaScript so we're going to go ahead and do that now the property we're going to use is the visibility property so that's the property that we're going to be accessing and then the value that we want to set this to is hidden and so that should hide the button after we click the button this button should be hidden so that the user can no longer hit it again so let's save everything up here let's go ahead and save this and you know what let's actually flip back to our JavaScript code so we can watch this when we hit the button and well you know what I didn't need a dot there that was a mistake okay so you can see there's another bug and now we'll hit our button and there you can see it worked it got rid of the button and the user can no longer click on it which would cause that nasty little bug where the text basically disappears forever into the void but really we should have warned the user when they hit that button that they couldn't go back that that button would disappear and that these changes were essentially irreversible so what we need to do now is actually create a confirmation button to at least give the user a chance to back out of this potential change we'll cover that in the next video
