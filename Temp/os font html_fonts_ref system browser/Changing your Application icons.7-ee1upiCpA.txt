oh hey what's up guys this mac has 11 and a couple people requested or one person requested how to change your icon arm for any application so because previously I showed how to make some of the Adobe icons and I don't know maybe someone made a cooler one made one that they think is cooler and they want to exchange it so after this example I'll show you all the Firefox I'll change its icon but I'll keep a copy so first off our applications aren't really on applications well they are but what I mean by that is their kind of folders but they did just if you double click on the folder it'll bring you inside of a folder but if you double-click on an application um it'll launch the application so in order to view the inside of the folder you're gonna have to right click on a Mac its control click but obviously on the Mac you can't do this on PC well you can't do it the way we're doing it show package content and that that'll open up the folder inside so now we're inside of the folder Firefox like here are inside applications here or inside Firefox so take another icon and I'll use I'll use you know what taco HTML like it I like it I John okay so I'm just gonna okay so right now I have two things usually you're just going to see the inside the folder can just going to see one folder it's called content and then you're going to see resources Mac and stuff so right now with two things and you see they're very similar ok info and you'll get package info or package info and you'll get on maybe some code we shorted some plugins macro sites and resources go into resources and go to resources usually resources is going to have a whole bunch of pictures for forearm well what's it called that you'll see like here's the mouse cursor for when you're over and a whole bunch of pictures that you'll see in that application so on you'll see the picture for the icon will always be there so i'll just copy that and paste it there i'll copy that and paste it so let's say you photoshop something okay so right here I have firefox icons or die icns and I want the taco to be Saigon so I can just um yeah i'll put that make a new folder because you can't two things and seem so i'll just put that my home directory for now okay so now I'm gonna press ENTER press apple a copy that name cuz inside there's code for the thing so you can't have it any name you want and you i'm going to paste that name there so now that that's called star fox that icon is um icns i can just bring that right into there it's going to ask me if I want replace it I'll say yes and if you look at my doc well my doc didn't change yet hold on quit Firefox so now i go into applications i'll go to firefox and firefox has a taco icon so I'm going to just change it back for all i'll show you guys real quickly how to do it first you right-click on the application say show package contents you'll see a folder called content click on that go into resources look for on the icon it should be dot icns and it's usually going to be the name of the application drag the other one that you want in there make sure it has the same name that's um how you change your icon I know there's another application that does it for you i think it's called um lollipop or candy shop or something like that la e pop mac well ok well whatever but I I know that I don't like to use that application that much because it doesn't really back it up and if you have a full picture that you want to use as an image it'll use the image icon so it doesn't work that well for me on um doesn't back things up and um I just think it's safer to do it this way because you know what you're doing so um thank you very very much I hope this helped and goodbye
