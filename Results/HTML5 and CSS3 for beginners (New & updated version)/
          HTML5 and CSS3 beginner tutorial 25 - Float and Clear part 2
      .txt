hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and welcome to tutorial number 25 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how it floats and clear two boxes so once the left and one to the right we often use float and clear to create columns and stuff like that and you know basically like I said in a previous tutorial float and clear can be used for many things so this is what we ended the last tutorial off with and you can see that we used float to float an image into the corner of some text right so I'm gonna go ahead and just clear all of that code out of my CSS I'm also going to clear all of that code out of my body and let's take a look at float and clear part two right so like I said I want to create a box to the left and then a box to the right so let's create a div and I'm gonna give this div a class of box box one and then I'm also gonna copy that div and move it over move over to a new line and call that one box too so we'll say that box one is the left side and we'll say that box two is the right side save this now come back over the browser hit refresh and you can see we've got our left side and we've got our right side but right now they're not displaying on the left and the right instead they're displaying one above the other so let's give this a little bit of styling I'm gonna select box one by its class and I'm gonna give it a border of four pixels solid red I'm also gonna give it a height of 400 pixels and we can do the same thing for box too so let me copy and paste that down here box to save come back yeah hit refresh and let's change that border to blue just so we can see what's going on a little bit more clearly so like I've told you guys many times in the past divs always extend to take up the full width of the browser that is until you float them right so let's float left and for the other one let's float that right right and once you float a div like this it loses its width so let's come back and hit refresh and now you can see we've got our left sign on the left and we've got our right side on the right and the width has become Auto so basically it's made itself as wide as the content inside of the div is right and it's the same thing on this side here as well so basically if you want these divs to take up 50% and 50% you could come back here and give this a width of 50% and then you go over to the next one and give that a width of 50% save this and hit refresh and now you can see with a little bit of problem because they're not displaying next to each other anymore we don't have our left side on the left and our right side on the right and that is a bit of a problem but the reason why that I came across is because if I inspect that in Firebug and I hover over this element you can see that box 1 has a border of 4 pixels on the left it's also got a border of 4 pixels on the right and then it's got its width over here in the actual element so what that means is our elements is 50% width which in this case happens to be 712 pixels plus 4 on the Left plus 4 on the right so it basically makes this element more than 50% of the width and then it also makes this element more than 50% of the width so each one of them is more than 50% now they're too big to fit next to each other if that makes sense you can you can see that overlapping happened just over there right there too big to fit next to each other so the right side drops and displays below the left and we don't want that so a simple solution might be to just make that a little bit smaller forty-nine percent and then make that one a little bit smaller as well come back here refresh and now we've got our left side on the our left side on the left and our right side on the right but we don't know how big this spacing is gonna be I mean if I resize the browser that's facing you get bigger or smaller depending on what the width of the browser is so that's sometimes it's not really the best solution let's go back here make the box one 50% and box to 50% again and another way to get rid of something like this is to just not use borders so let's make those both zero pixels or we could just remove the line either way all right and come back here refresh and now we've got both of these to the left and to the right and there's actually no spacing between those so okay one way I could do this is inspect element and now you can see left side or box one goes all the way to touching the right hand side of the box and then the right-hand side also touches the left-hand side of the box so there's no spacing between the two of these and an easier way to see that might be to just add a background of red to box one and a background of blue to box to right so let's come back in here refresh these boxes are displayed pushed up against each other sometimes you might want to have a little bit of spacing over here and you might want to determine how big that spacing is so in this case let's say I want 30 pixels between these two boxes well again if I come back over to Box 1 and I give this a margin right of 30 pixels come back here I'll save this and come back over the browser and hit refresh boom box 2 is now back below box 1 instead of next to each other and the reason for that again inspect element you can see that box 1 now has a margin on the right of 30 pixels so again it's bigger than 50% it's bigger than the width that you were trying to allow it to be and therefore they don't fit next to each other anymore so what I'm trying to say here is borders and margins and padding's contribute to the overall width of your element and if you add borders and modest margins and padding's you might have this problem where when you're trying to float things to the left and to the right they don't fit and then they drop down below each other so you need to work away around that and I find one of the solutions in doing that is to not add borders or modern margins or pairings anything to the parent elements but rather to create a child element within the div so in this case let's go over to box 1 will indent these little bits of text and I'm gonna place them within another div and we'll give that a class of inner box right so let's copy and paste that text into there and get rid of that spacing and we can do the same thing with the right-hand side and now if I come back here refresh we've got these two next to each other but like I said I wanted to have 30 pixels of spacing between these two so to do that let's get rid of the background colors and the borders and we'll do the same with number two and then we can select the children inside of these elements so let's go box one and then we'll select the inner box inside of box one so in well now what we're doing is instead of selecting this element we're selecting this element spoken about child classes before so that's exactly what happens here or child selectors and let's give that a background of red and we'll do the same for box two box 2 s in a box we'll make that or have that with the background of blue and now they're displaying next to each other they've lost the height reason why is because the height was given to the parent and the parent now long that no longer has a background color so you might want to take that height out and put that down here as well if you're expecting to have the height and then all let's just save and refresh all right so now that they've got their Heights back but I want that spacing here so now in a box of box one can have a margin right of 30 pixels and that's gonna give it that little bit of space what that does mean is that box 1 is now smaller than box 2 so you might want to actually give this a margin right of 15 pixels and then copy that down to the next one and give that any margin left of 15 pixels and that will keep them exactly the same size with that spacing in the middle so you could do it that way are other ways you could take care of this as well and yeah there's many different ways to get get around this problem right so it just depends on how you want to do things and what the ultimate goal or look for you is gonna be but like I said there are many uses for this because sometimes you might want to have a paragraph of text over here and then an image to the right we might want to have an image to the left and some paragraph of text to the right so it all depends on on what it is you're trying to do and yeah we will be taking a look at more examples of this in future there won't be specifically dedicated to floating clear but hopefully we'll use a practical example somewhere and you'll get to see exactly how this all works I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development
