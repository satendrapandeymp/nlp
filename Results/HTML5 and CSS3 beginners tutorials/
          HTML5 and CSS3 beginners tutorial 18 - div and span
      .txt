hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 18 and in this tutorial I am going to talk to you guys about two HTML elements that are made to be used specifically with CSS okay and these tags are the div and span tags now unlike any other HTML elements that you may have worked with before these two tags don't actually change the content in any way at all so if I were to make use of a div element real quick I go ahead and open up my div tag over here and I'll go close it down here and you'll see any content that I put inside the stove tag won't actually change unless I use CSS to change this tag for me okay so let's go ahead and just put in a heading two and ending heading two and in the heading we can go ahead and say apples are good and then I'll go to the new line and make a paragraph and then this paragraph will just say an apple a day keeps the doctor away if you didn't see that coming then well okay cool so now we've got just a normal header and a normal paragraph and if I go ahead and run this in Firefox you can see that it displays as a normal heading two and a normal paragraph so having these two tags inside of a div tag didn't change the way that they display at all okay and again if I go ahead and I give you the same example with a span tag you'll see that the span tag isn't going to change a word at all either so I'm going to go ahead and just surround this word apple with span tags and if I go back and refresh again we don't have any change whatsoever to the word Apple okay so like I said these tags by themselves do absolutely nothing but with CSS we can go ahead and actually change those tags to make our website look pretty or just change the display of something on our website so let's go ahead and style our div tag and we can go ahead and give that a border of one pixel solid and red and I want to give this a background color as well so background color of yellow and I'm going to give this a width of 250 pixels just so that we can see the actual block a little bit better and then I'm going to go ahead and give this style my span tag now sorry and I'll set that equal to a color of maybe green so the text will be green and then I'll go ahead and use text decoration which is a property if you want to underline your text you can go ahead and use text decoration so underline and that should make our word appear underlined okay now before we go back to Firefox and click refresh I just want to mention to you guys or explain to you guys why I wrote my tags out like that's like why div is like a block and then the span tag I left as an inline thing so I went ahead and I just wrote span and ending span in the same line and the reason for that is because a div tag is actually a block element so I like to write my tags the same way that they would display in the browser and a block a div tag is a block level element so that means that if I were to make another div tag on my page then we'd basically have two blocks and these blocks would obviously contain whatever content is inside of the block okay so basically a div is a big block that we can put on our page whereas a span tag is actually an inline element so that means that this tag isn't going to break down to a new line it's not going to display as a block or anything like that it's just going to change the content inside of the two tags or in between the tags but it's not going to actually do anything else whereas if I were to put the div tag maybe around the word day then they would be in its own block so we'd actually land up having an apple earth then we'd start our new block which means that this word day would be on a new line and then we'd go the block would end of the day and then we create we'd have another line and new line that says keeps the doctor away so go ahead and just experiment with it yourself if you guys don't know what I'm saying but basically a div tag is a block level element so it's going to break to a new line whereas a span tag is an inline element so it's not going to break to a new line okay so let's go back here now and click refresh and we'll get our styling up here okay all appearing okay so now we've got our block over here and as you can see we've got a border of one pixel red and we've got a background color that's yellow so that that's our div tag done also the width is 250 which is actually quite convenient because it fits the content very nicely and then we've gone ahead and weave in our span tag just turn all the text green and underline any text in our span tag so that's basically how you use your div and span tags like you'll use your div to make a big block on the page and a span tag just to change some words in a sentence okay and that's actually all I wanted to show you guys in this tutorial so don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
