today we're going to take a look at something that confuses a lot of beginning HTML and CSS designers and it's called positioning more specifically though the difference between what we call absolute positioning and relative positioning let's take a look I am going to browse to my index dot HTML file and I want to create a box so we can do that by using a simple div and we'll give this a class of box now I'm going to leave it empty because we're only going to use style dot CSS to style this box first we reference the class by doing period box and now I'm going to set a width and a height of 200 pixels and in fact why don't we increase this to 400 and I'm also going to set the margin to auto to Center it on the page and finally set a background color of red now if I load this in the browser this is more or less what you would expect right so let's take a look at positioning what if we wanted to move this box to the left all right I'll show you how first we'll set what we call a positioning context position is relative and when you set this you now have the ability to specify top left right and bottom values so watch what happens if I set top of 200 pixels reload and notice it pushed it down and this is something that confuses a lot of people why is it going down when we set it to top and when you specify top you're not saying go to the top 200 pixels what you're saying is from the top push it 200 pixels so if you can imagine little guys on each side and what you're saying here is get the guys on the top and they're going to push this box 200 pixels and the only direction they could push the box is down so if you said right we're going to get the little guys on the right and they're going to push it to the left 200 pixels if I load now it's been pushed to the left so why don't we remove the margin reload the page and now you see that's being pushed off the page because of this right value so I will remove that next you notice this little bit of spacing where is that coming from remember that's coming from the browsers default style sheet we can remove this by setting body margin:0 and now that little bit of spacing has been removed now if we want to move our box to the left how about 400 pixels now it's been adjusted what if we want to move it down as well but remember we don't do bottom because that would push it up because the guys are on the bottom and they're going to push up as you can see right there so instead we want to specify top and we'll push it down 200 pixels like so so you might be thinking okay well that's easy enough to understand but what about absolute positioning that's a different option when we specify absolute now see how this changes reload the page and it's identical but it's only identical because we are specifying it in terms of the browser window it's going to be very different though if it's within a different context so for example why don't we cut this out and once again I'm going to specify margin of auto if we add a position in context again and let's test it out left 20 top 30 it moves it right there but if I change this to absolute it's going to be different now reload what why did that happen that makes no sense well it actually does we are now saying absolutely position this within its parent so that I know this is a little confusing absolutely position this within its nearest parent that is positioned in this case it's nearest positioned parent is the body element so now it's going to be in relation to this body and now we're saying from its parent we're going to specify left of 20 pixels from its top and top of 30 so let's see a better example I'm going to wrap this within a div with a class of wrap and I will simply paste this in next I'm going to style the wrapper we'll do it right here wrap width of 800 pixels margin of auto to Center it on the page and if I leave it like that maybe we'll apply a background just for the example and we'll also apply a height because there's nothing within this div reload no that it's not adjusting this box and that might be confusing well now the parent is wrapped so shouldn't it be placed absolutely in relation to this box well not yet because even though we have wrap it is not positioned watch what happens though when we apply a position in context of relative you're going to see this box move refresh now it's changed because now we are setting the box positioned absolutely in relation to its nearest parent which is the wrap so now it's limited to the width and the boundaries of the wrap hopefully that makes sense as I'm explaining it I can even imagine it being confusing and it probably is but just stick with it and work with me through these examples because there's a positioning context left 20 pixels is no longer 20 pixels from the browser window but 20 pixels from the left boundary of that parent right here if I set it to 0 it's going to be right up against that edge if we remove position relative the nearest parent is the body or the browser window in which case it's positioned all the way over here that's an important distinction to make so when would you use absolute positioning and you do it for little things like this let's say we have a width of 80 or 70 reload the page and you want to have maybe a little box over the top left edge so you'll position this negative 35 pixels like that and now you can add maybe a little ribbon right there if you just simply want to position something special whether it's a ribbon or a call-out something that exceeds the boundaries of your container because that makes things look nicer everything shouldn't have to be bound by very straight lines this can add a nice little effect but that's not the only way there are many many ways that you would use absolute positioning and we're going to cover some more of those as we continue on in this course so what you need to take away from this is a relative positioning gives us the ability to specify top left bottom and right I'll use so notice the rap if I set top 50 this is going to be pushed down as soon as I get rid of my position in context top will cease to take effect as you can see right there so if you are trying to use left and it doesn't seem to be working ask yourself have I positioned this element now when you absolutely position it rather than using values like left xx pixel rather than that being relative to the current position of the element it's then relative to the positioning of the parent so here box left 35 means go to the left 35 pixels from the left edge of the wrap container little confusing stick with it have a lot of fun with it try all the different ways that you can position an element both relatively and absolutely and see if you can wrap your mind around this and that's your big assignment for the rest of today
