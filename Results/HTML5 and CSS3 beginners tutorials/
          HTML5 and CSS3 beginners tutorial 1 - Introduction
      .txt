hey YouTube how's it going it's Quentin here and welcome to my html5 and css3 tutorial series reboot in this series we are going to learn how to create websites using html5 and css3 which in case you guys didn't know are the languages that websites are written in now I'm going to be recording the series as if you the viewer has had no previous experience in HTML or CSS before so if you are a complete beginner then don't worry you found the right series you can continue watching from here and you'll do great ok and if you guys do have a little bit of experience with HTML then you know you could carry on watching just for some revision or you could join in later on when we start talking about some more complicated stuff so because this is a tutorial series reboot I have to mention to you guys that I do have another HTML series on my channel at the moment and I don't want you to confuse the two okay the older one is going to have a different thumbnail to this new series so the older series will have a dark blue checkered thumbnail as the background and the new series is going to have a flat light blue background on the thumbnail now the difference between the two series is that my old series was recorded on my old computer with an old mic and a smaller screen so the quality of those tutorials are just really bad and I really wanted to redo them to improve on the quality of the tutorials on my channel ok so that's why I'm making a new series and if you guys want to follow this new series then just make sure you follow all the same thumbnails so to get started with this series there are two things that you guys are I have to download or maybe you've already got them on your computer okay and the first thing we need is a good text editor so the text editor that I use is notepad plus plus and it's a good one I would recommend if you're following along with my tutorials that you download that and I will show you how to download that in just a moment and then the second thing that we need or that you guys need is a good browser now I use Firefox but if you guys want to use Chrome that's up to you they both work equally as well okay but just make sure you're not using something like Internet Explorer or you know some older browser okay so let's take a look at installing notepad plus plus now what I'm going to do is just open up my browser and I'm going to google notepad plus plus okay so you can see that I've got this link that shows up at the top here which I'll click and that's going to take me straight to the download page for notepad plus plus now of course I want the latest version which at this moment in time is version six point five point three but if you're watching this like six months from now there's probably going to be a newer version so whatever it is just download the latest version so I'm going to go ahead and click download and I'm going to click save now it's probably worth mentioning that if you guys are using a Mac then notepad plus plus will not work on your computer and you're going to have to download something like text wrangler or some other alternative now that doesn't mean you won't be able to follow along with my tutorials it just means that you will be typing in a text editor that looks different to mine okay so I would go ahead and just Google a few other options and see what you can come up with and go from there okay so I'm going to go ahead and click install here so yep I'm going to save this and I'm going to run it you guys probably weren't able to see that message that I just clicked on by the way it was like that Windows message but anyways okay so please select the language I'm English so I'm just going to go ahead and click English next and I mean you guys pretty much know how to install a program so will obviously read through all of this stuff just make sure that we don't sign our life away go ahead and click I agree a destination folder that's fine and I will go ahead and just leave everything as default go ahead and click Next and I want to desktop shortcuts so I'll go ahead and I'll take that make sure that you're not installing any malware or anything that's the most important or most irritating part about installing new software which fortunately notepad plus plus doesn't have any malware so I'm we're lucky go ahead and click run notepad we'll go ahead and finish this okay so now you can see that notepad plus plus is open on my screen and this is just the changelog so what's new whoops so this is just telling us what's new in this version and we can go ahead and close that because there's nothing really interesting there for now okay so now we can actually start writing our code but I think I'm going to save that for the next tutorial so guys get keen to learn how to write websites and come back in the next tutorial where we'll actually start writing some code and as always don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment give the video a thumbs up or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow so thank you very much and I'll see you guys next time
