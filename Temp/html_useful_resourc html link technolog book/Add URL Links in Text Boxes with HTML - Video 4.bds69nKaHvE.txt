Oh 1n welcome back to hunter tools so in this video we're going to quickly look at how to add in a URL and to some text that you might be writing on your HTML page or your hope page and to do that we're going to use an HTML tag or code so let's quickly have a look so on the typography we don't have that feature to add in a URL we do have it in the action so we wanted to put in an object and have that click on to a mouse for example we could we could do that so we could put a text button and and then we could go mouse click and then we put the action and then we can go to URL or compose an email which are two common things that you might want to do but of course we want to make put then we typically or a lot of time we want to put that into the text that we're actually writing so what we can do is put a text back button and we could write in for example I'll just close this just a little bit smaller we could type in welcome to and then we can put in our HTML tag so we don't share the right and the usual HTML casing so you know like you know to put an HTML tag back here to tag a body tag which shits up the HTML code for the page that's already underlined here so all we have to do is type in the tag that we need so we're going to go welcome to and then we're going to put on our URL reference so there's an HTML code and looks like this so okay and then we go href and that's the key part and then we're going to go equals and in quotation marks and then we go HTTP and outputting the URL and we can put an S as well if you want and put them the two dots and in the colon and in two back spaces and then we're going to put in the actual URL if you want so in this case we have wmw got Google and google.com and then we're going to close that off with some more parentheses so as you can see we've got at the beginning of the tag then we've got the URL tag and then we've got the actual URL and then we're gonna close that off like that but then of course that's just going to be invisible so what we need to do is we need to actually add a word so in this terms are going to write Google all right Google and then we're going to close that off like that backspace a and then close it up again with the great end zone so what that does is put to Google and then I'm going to put a full-stop at the end of the completeness and voila so let's see what that does well this is welcome to Google so I'm going to click on Google and it goes straight to the Google page so I'm pretty happy with that so let's go let's close it off so the next thing I want to do is maybe I don't want to open up within the current browser window so I'm going to click on that again and what if I want to change that I'm gonna have to put on a target or they call it target so we were to put that so I go back to the end of the URL and it makes them room and I type in target and then I go at key course I get quotes again and you get underscore now what I can do is there are four main types so they are blank underscore blank there's under school self and the school parent and underscore top so under school blank will load page into a new browser window and the school self will load the page it page into the current window and the school parent loads the page into the frame that are superior to the frame the high blinkers then basically and the underscore top cancels all frames and loads and for browser one day so you can play around with those depending on what uses you need so in this case well it looks like it's defaulting to underscore South I'm going to put underscore blank so it's going to open up in a new browser so let's see if that works you put this up quotes at the end of that so I've got the URL and the target equals quotes underscore blank quotes so instead of having self or their or parent or top which way we're probably loaded up in most cases in the same browser and the school blanks gonna load it up in the new window so let's just see if that works so it opens up again and it see if it'll open up in a beauty you want and it does so that's fantastic so hopefully that helps you can also do a third thing you might want to format the color and if you want to get the whole of that that video just let me know and I'll make that but basically we got to use the the font tag in HTML alright I hope you enjoyed that band some look forward to the next video I feel free to subscribe or like Cheers
