hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number seven in my HTML series and in this tutorial we are going to be talking about images okay now there are a few different things that we actually need to remember or have to do when adding an image to our website now the first thing is to actually have two images so I've got two over here so one is my desktop background and the other one is the image that I was using for a little project that I made a few days ago okay now I'm going to keep these images in the same folder or the same directory as my index.html file okay so they're all under a folder called tutorial seven as you can see and basically this is just going to allow whenever I want to add an image all I need to know is the image name okay if you guys want to be able to keep your pictures in a different folder you're going to have to learn about directory paths which I will talk about in the next tutorial but for now please remember just to keep them in the same folder as your index.html file okay so to add an image onto our website we use the image tag except you don't type the word image okay you type in I M G okay and that means image okay and the image tag is a single tag so we can go ahead and close that off now but there are a few attributes now if you guys watch the previous tutorial you learned about attributes and I told you that attributes are little bits of extra information that some of these HTML tags need to work okay now I can't just go ahead and put in this image tag on my website because HTML obviously doesn't know what image I want to use so I have to give it a little bit of extra information to tell it which image to use okay so the attribute that we put in to check or to tell HTML which image we want on the website is s our C and that stands for image source okay and we're going to set that equal to the name of our image okay so because whoops okay because my images on the same folder as my index file all I have to do is type in that image name so I'm going to go ahead and use the ghost dot ping image and when I save this now and go back to Firefox and click refresh well I'll actually ran it you can see I've got this ghost showing up on the screen so it's sort of like a pacman ghosts but this was for project that I did a little while ago okay so now we've got the image on the screen but to put in just image source as the attribute is not actually correct it's not valid because what happens if HTML can't find this image so let's say I made a spelling mistake and I put got or whatever okay if we go back to Firefox now and click refresh Firefox couldn't find the image named god so like nothing shows up on the page okay so that's why we've got the second attribute called alt and what this does is it puts out some writing of whatever image was supposed to be there okay so let's just say a ghost image over here and whatever we put inside this old attribute whatever we set this alt attribute equal to that is what will display on the screen if Firefox or Google Chrome couldn't find the image okay so there we've got ghost image okay so that that would only show up if the image can't be found but it's not valid to put an image on your website with just the source attribute you have to also use an alt attribute in case the browser couldn't find the image or in case maybe whoever was coming to your web site turn images off in their browser or something okay so let's go ahead and just correct that save it go back to Firefox and as you can see when the image is found then we don't get this alt attribute we don't get these words showing up on the page okay so the only reason why they're there is because it's not valid otherwise now the next thing I want to show you guys is two more attributes which are considered good practice to keep in your image tag but they can also be used to resize the image on the webpage as well so instead of using ghost typing I'm going to use this image called Ashe dot JPEG okay so let's go ahead and just change this up Ashe dot jpg dot okay and I can change that up not that we need to but the two other attributes that I want to talk to you guys about are called the width and we got to set that equal to whatever the image width is and the height okay and we're going to set that equal to the height so let me just go back and find out how big that was okay so it was 1920 by 1080 pixels so that's quite quite big so it's not even going to fit on the entire screen but let's go ahead and save this now click refresh and you can see we've only got a small section of the image showing okay so it's actually this really big image of Ashe from league of legends so as you can see this image is not showing up in the browser correctly it's it's way too big for what I need so what I can do is I can use these width and these height attributes to actually change the size of the image so let's say I actually only wanted it to be about 900 by 500 pixels or 480 pixels I think will do so let's go ahead and save that now go back to Firefox click refresh and as you can see we now have the image almost fitting correctly into the browser okay now even though we have the ability to resize our image down with these attributes it's still recommended to actually make the image the correct size in the first place reason why is because let's say people have like a slow internet connection or something if they go to your website they still going to have to load that entire image and then resize it so they're still going to load that huge image and then resize it down to the smaller size to be able to see it okay so it's still going to include or add to the loading time and that's going to be annoying for some people okay but the main reason why these things are here is to set aside space for the image okay so even if the Firefox or something could not find this image and it had to show this alt attribute - okay it would still set aside 900 pixels and 480 pixels of space for that image so your website wouldn't look funny when someone came to your website to actually look at it okay so actually nothing would look out of place because of the missing image okay so that's why we have the width and the height attribute so thank you guys for watching that's all I have for you guys in this tutorial don't forget
