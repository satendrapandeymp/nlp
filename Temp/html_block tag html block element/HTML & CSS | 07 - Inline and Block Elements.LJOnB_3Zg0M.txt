what's up guys Laurie here from code freedom welcome to the seventh installment this video series so today we're gonna be a very short video we're gonna talk about inlined and block elements is the very simple concept but something you guys must get straight make sure you understand this concept thoroughly before you proceed on to the next videos it's not that we're gonna you don't explicitly talk about this and want some things you should keep in your mind because it kind of goes a long way when you're in terms of you know developing things making things look nice and design wise so let's get into it let's open up our code editor you can see right in here I have my normal basic structure I don't think I'm gonna to refer to this anymore I'm pretty sure up till now you would understand what's going on how normal of basic layout for HTML file looks like so in my body tag gonna open up a an image tag and I'm gonna link that same major like I did before and load that in and just because I said it it's very big file let's change the width to exactly 100 pixels and we actually have to do the height 1 we can just click Save go into our browser and then refresh it and we'll open it up and I didn't even edit the height 1 so now we're all good to go now let's make sure that was good okay now uh in terms of images images are something are considered inline elements and these are completely different than inline other than a block elements so let's create a blog an example of a block am i one of them is a paragraph so we can just open or even the heading so since we will be using paragraphs for a while we just learned heading we can actually implement heading so let's do a heading heading 3 and let's input something like this this is a block save it load it in our google chrome you can see that this text is open and I used to notice that this image file shifted down piece of text for example or a heading or a paragraph it's considered a block element these things take up a giant block of space right over here so each time you use a heading it is going to receive its own line of code nothing else can interfere with it as much like much of the Spacek as a can so right now it's taking up this entire space right here this image right here is actually in line it's actually part of this line and you can actually line something up next to it so for example we can do is load up the image as I mentioned before my directory I have three of the same images with different names so I'm going to load logo to save this file reload it now just like what I loaded the the image first and the text is shifted it down you would think that okay maybe if I put this next new line for an image that they were open up to a new line that actually is it opens right next to it in line elements such as images they line up next to each other they don't need a separate line by themselves unlike block elements like paragraph and headings that are like okay I need this entire block of space and no one no one else can interfere with me so that's what we is so that's what when you're using images you want to make sure design wise that if you want them separately there's a way to do that and it'll vest a gate that further so we'll take a look at that as we proceed on with this course and I'm sure you guys will understand it much better so next time we're actually gonna learn about lists which kind of go hand-in-hand with this block concept and we're gonna talk about less than how to you
