hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series we are learning hyperlinks we understood how we can create hyperlinks by using the anchor tag how we can convert a text to hypertext how we can use image as a hyperlink to navigate from one page to another page in this tutorial I am going to discuss how we can use anchor tag to navigate from one section to the another section within the same page so let's get started I go to start click on run I say here notepad then I click on OK I am going to create HTML structure I say here head closing head body tag closing body tag in between the head section I am going to say title closing title file save as I'm going to save this with the name default jefa ult dot HTML I save it at the desktop you can see that default dot HTML page created I never click on it to open it in Firefox open you can see that title is set to the path of the file here I am going to give home page file save go to browser refresh home page is the title now let's begin here I am going to create three different sections okay by using the paragraph tag closing paragraph tag here I say top section I copy this then I paste it down and here I say middle section I paste again I say here bottom section file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have top section middle section bottom section then I am going to add some breaks in between so that I can be able to create three proper sections here here after this paragraph tag I am going to use the break tag I copy this paste it baste it baste it baste it five times I copy this these fire breaks and I paste five times one two three four five file save go to browser refresh you can see that the middle section moved down okay instead of break you might be having here content okay I am just adding break four just to simulate okay just to make you understand I'm adding the breaks here you can you might have be having instead of break here so much content I copy this all breaks from here I pasted down-- file save go to browser refresh now we have a space between the middle section and the bottom section you can see similarly I add breaks below the bottom section also file save go to browser refresh top section we have some space middle section we have some space bottom section we have some space you might be having some content here you might be having some content here you might be having some content here okay let's proceed further now instead of using this scroll bar to navigate from one section to the another section I want to create some hyperlinks so that I can be able to navigate from one section to the another section easy to navigate from one section to the another section within the same page we are going to follow two steps which are most important first step is to name these sections we have to give names to all sections let's begin then to name the section I am going to use an anchor tag so I use an anchor tag then I am going to use an attribute called as name equal to in double quotations I have to give the name I give here top section SEC tion top section you can give any name here okay then I say greater than symbol then I say closing anchor tag file save go to browser refresh we created a section here okay I copy this I give names to all other sections here I say anchor tag name this one is going to be M I double D le middle section file save I copy this I go down and to this section I am going to give bottom section the name is going to be P or ttom bottom section file save go to browser refresh we have given section names for all the sections we have given name next thing is to create hyperlinks there's a second step first they I what I do I go here I create one more paragraph and here I write go to M I double D le middle section file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have go to middle section displayed I am going to convert this to anchor or a hyperlink so I need to use the anchor tag opening anchor tag closing anchor tag then I should give hyperlink reference href equal to double quotation in between this I am going to write hash hash indicates do not navigate to some other page it indicates that you should be in the same page if I click on go to middle section it should be in the same page okay file save go to browser and refresh if I click on you can see that you have a hyperlink now if I click on that it won't navigate to some other page we are in the same page right we are in the same place hash we are going to write hash when we don't know where to navigate okay if I click on go to middle section it should go to middle section what I have to do means after this hash I have to give name of that section the name of the section we have here written I am going to copy this from here middle section and I paste it after the hash okay file save go to browser refresh this time if I click on go to middle section we are telling to the system be in the same page search for an anchor tag which has a name middle section search for it and navigate to that place if I click on that you can see that we are at middle section so from here to here it has came same thing I am going to copy this paste it down and this time I am going to say to system that if I click on go to Bo TT om bottom section I am going to remove this file save go to browser refresh if you see here we have go to bottom section at present I am telling be in the same page by writing the hash symbol it will be in the same page but I do not want to be in the same place I want it to move to bottom section so here I have to give the name of the section b OT t om bottom sec tion bottom section file save go to browser refresh this time i am telling to the system if i click on go to bottom section b in the same page search for the anchor tag which has the name bottom section and navigate to that section let's see now if i click on go to bottom section it has moved to bottom section hope you guys are understanding if i click on go to middle section it goes to middle section guys now what I do I am going to copy this content from here I go down here at the middle section you can see that if I go to middle section I don't have a option to go to top section again I have to use this scroll bar what I do here below this I paste it down and Here I am going to say go to top section here I have to give the name of the section right so here I say top section file save go to browser refresh if I click on go the middle section I go to middle section if I click on go to top section I go to the objection very nice I am going to copy this I go down paste here and here I am going to say instead of top section yeah I need to have a top section only file save go to browser refresh if I go to bottom section I am at bottom section now I click on go to top section now I came back to top section I can go to middle section I can go to to objection this is how we can create navigation within the same page twice okay usually you can see in Wikipedia and all you will see like there will be some content if you click on history link it will directly navigate within the same page goes to the history section right very very useful information guys I hope you guys have understood how we can create navigation within the same page what is the meaning of hash symbol in this one when you don't know where to navigate you can use the hash symbol that indicates be in the same page for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits
