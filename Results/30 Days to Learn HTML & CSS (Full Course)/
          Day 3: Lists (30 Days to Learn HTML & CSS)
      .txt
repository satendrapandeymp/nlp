welcome to day three so I noted in the last lesson that today we would cover how to create a list of items if you've used a normal text editor you might do this this is my list here is another item this is fairly common right well with an HTML what would happen if we just saved this and came back and viewed it we would get it all on one line because remember HTML it's not going to honor this whitespace unless you tell it to instead it's just going to read this all as one long string as you can see like so so there's a couple ways around this one is to use what we call a break element and that means create a line break here let's do that now I can do VR and self close it as we did up here or it's equally okay for you to do it like so so let's keep it like this way for now as a rule of thumb though try to be consistent so if you leave it off try to leave it off in all places of your document it'll make it a little cleaner so in this case I will go ahead and remove that like so and now if I come back and reload the page can you see that now each one of these is our is on our own line but again as soon as we add another item I'll save that and come back it's all going to be on that own line so you need to specify each place where there's a line break so what if you wanted more than one line break you could add another one so now I'm going to say have two line breaks like so so as you can imagine though this is the way it was done in the old days and this can really quickly create very very sloppy code so it is okay to use a break element when that is really what you need you need a line break however most of the time you'll find there is a better tool for the job in this case we're trying to create a list but we're not using actual HTML markup to create a list let's do that now we specify a list by doing UL now there are a couple types of Lists and we'll go over each one today this one is called an unordered list which means we're not doing this and numbers meaning number one number two there is no order so we use an ordered list again I closed it out because I have to specify when this list completes and that's the only way I can do it let's add a list item so I don't simply add my items here I have to use another tack and this is called a child tag list item and now I will say go to the mall maybe we have our tasks again I have to close out my list item so let's save that and see what we get now again note that by default it doesn't have to be this way but by default we have a bullet and it's indented a little bit now this is important for me to drill into your head a list does not have to be formatted like you would normally see whether it's tasks or anything of that nature a list simply refers to the most basic level a list of items that's it as long as what you are adding within your list conforms to that then it's fine there is an element called definition list that we'll look at shortly that is the same way a definition list has a definition followed by the term followed by the actual definition or the details and you can have a list of these so as long as it conforms to the word list you can use it and you don't need to worry about how it looks on the page by default at all because that is all over rideable let's add a couple more so I can do this manually or it's common to select the entire bit of code and here on the Mac I'm doing shift command right on the PC it'll probably be ctrl shift right then I will hit command C or control C and command V or control V and I will assume that you have a basic understanding of how to do those types of tasks so now we will say shop and we'll do one more get gas and drive home like so let's save that and note that we have a bit of space in here always try to be consistent so if we don't have any spacing up here we probably shouldn't have any here now this all comes down to personal preference so the key is be consistent if you like a space and I do this sometimes to give some breathing room then always try to do that here otherwise it can get a little messy when your markup is is inconsistent I'm gonna save that come back refresh the page and now as we would hope we have a nice list of items so if we were to come back and let's say we want to remove this and we want to provide the heading things I need to do today well on this page the most important heading is things I need to do today so I will do h1 things I must do today and I'm gonna close that off save it and now we have a nice task list and this is something you could do on your own if you need to keep a list of things you need to do that day you can code it in HTML and you don't have to worry about using a program like word to format it because this will work perfectly next let's take a look at an ordered list and the only difference is rather than using ul we use o L now sublime text has a nice feature where if you select a bit of text and on the Mac its ctrl command G you can see that it will select every occurrence of that sequence so what's nice about this is it will create multiple cursors if I wanted to change this to an ordered list after pressing control/command G I can now type oh L and notice that it updates in each section on the PC on the other hand you will press alt f3 so for example if I said hello and down here hello and then maybe up here hello as well I'm going to select this word press ctrl command G on the Mac or alt f3 and it's going to select every occurrence of this but it's not just a find and replace it creates cursors if i zoom in notice that there's a cursor here here and here and now I can delete that and write goodbye believe it or not this is a very new addition to code editors and it's vital that you use it we took these days that I couldn't imagine not having this option available and I also want you to note it's only available to my understanding in sublime text but it'll surely become available in other editors in the future but it's a very good technique to have especially in situations like this where we only need to one or two letters rather than doing it manually like this which takes time and it's still okay if you do that I would prefer to select it and update both at once so now we've switched to an ordered list let's see what the difference is now this is more appropriate when you need to number things number one number two as you can see right here so whether you use an unordered list an ordered list really comes down to how you intend to use it in this case of tasks I think it makes more sense to use an unordered list because there is no order of events so I will switch that back however if I did something like the five best ways to code then I would use an ordered list for number one number two number three number four and number five so now that we've covered unordered lists and ordered lists let's take a look at the last and least common which is the definition list so we will place this at the top and we do a definition list by doing DL notice how often the element names correspond to the actual name DL for definition list this is slightly more complex but you can understand it a definition list requires for each item the term as well as the details so it's fun to use it for definitions but it doesn't have to as long as you can make it fit into that concept I'll just stick with the definition idea and let's say we want the definition term and we'll say sublime and I'm gonna close it out and now we need to provide the definition for this or the details for that it doesn't have to be a definition it's just simply a way to connect this to this value and I will say a code editor let's view that in the browser refresh and now notice that the default formatting is to have the term here then the details or the definition is on its own line and indented so if we wanted to have a handful of these I could copy this and paste them in like so and I'll do a couple more I've refreshed now you can see all of them take that syntax and styling but again it does not have to if you would like the details to be on the same line as the term you can do that as well and we'll learn how to do that when we dig into our CSS for now we need to learn the basics and the structure of our page before we can style our page now before we finished up for the day I want you to take note of a couple of things remember how within our paragraph we could say hi and then we could make their bold like so this is perfectly fine and clean markup now this is not necessarily always going to be true for example there are elements that will only accept certain other elements as children now I want you to remember when I say children and parents you can use the indentation as triggers in your mind the definition list has children and those children are the DT elements and the DD and we indent them to specify that they are children but you don't have to notice if I did this like so and I viewed it in the browser nothing would changed it's all the same but we indent for ourselves and because it creates cleaner code also is a nicer way to know these are children of this element so for example the DT is a child of the definition list this paragraph element is a child not of the h1 but a child of the body element and we're going to take a look at that in DES for much more specifically but for now it's important for you to know that you cannot simply take this paragraph of text right here and put it within a definition list let's see what would happen if we did though save it and if I've refreshed the page you will see that it seemingly works let's try removing it and we'll place it down here as well refresh and seemingly it does work and this is an important distinction to make is that the browser will make up for your bad coding always remember that the browser will make assumptions about what you meant here so even though this is a bad practice the browser will say okay well he meant well let's just go ahead and display this on the page but a definition list only wants definition terms and details and if you don't follow this in some browsers there may be errors because while chrome may be smart enough to make up for your bad coding maybe an old version of Internet Explorer will not so always follow best practices and this is going to be true for an unordered list as well we cannot simply add a heading tag we cannot simply add a heading tag like so if I view it in the browser it'll display fine but it's not following good practices an unordered list wants list items as children it didn't ask for a heading or anything that is not a list item in this case if we wanted to add a heading within a list you can do that but make sure you place it within a list item link so now if I come back it's going to look the same but it's following the best practices now here's one other quick note is what if you have a heading and then you want a paragraph if I save that reload that looks fine but notice how quickly this is getting messy so if you have just a bit of text or code you can place it on one line like so but if you have a lot it's a best practice to separate the list item into one or more lines and then you can take everything within it and indent like so so now we have a list item and within and here are the children and it's going to display the same but it looks much cleaner so always follow good indentation practices in the next lesson we're going to focus on parent-child relationships and what that
