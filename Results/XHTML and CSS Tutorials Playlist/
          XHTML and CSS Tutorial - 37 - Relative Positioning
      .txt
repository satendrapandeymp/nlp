what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome back to your 37th XHTML and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial as promised I'm going to be talking to you guys about a different kind of positioning and that's called relative positioning now relative positioning is kind of similar to absolute positioning but it's also very different so you're saying how can it be similar and extremely different but it is so let me go ahead and show that to you guys let's go ahead and first make a couple paragraphs on the screen so P P and just go ahead and like right first let me just go ahead and copy this make like four paragraphs or something that will be fine first second third and fourth but give this third one an ID oops I'm a computer program in computer program and you put equal sign twice and that's what I thought I was doing so anyways ID equals third by the way you guys should check out my computer program it's toriel's so pretty cool that's just a side note anyways now for our third paragraph let's first of all give it absolute positioning because that's what we know already so in order to do that go ahead and make your ID third and go ahead and give it a border of like whoa definitely spell that wrong border one pixel solid green that'll make it easy to see and what else can we do position:absolute and now let's go ahead and move it top sixty pixels and also left arm 30 pixels I don't like my talking left to be the same same ways if we go ahead and save this what we're going to see is this we're going to see through I mean four paragraphs on the screen and then we're going to see that third paragraph move sixty pixels down from this top point right here and 30 pixels right so somewhere right in there so check it out we have the first second third and this third box right here from the top left corner of your screen is moved down sixty pixels and right 30 pixels because that's what absolute positioning does it takes this coordinate right here and it moves your box in relation to there so let's go ahead and now instead of absolute type in relative and save this and look how it changes the box is now down more and over to the right the same it's re saying alright what exactly is going on because this is kind of confusing so instead of 60 pixels from the top it's now a lot more so why did this happen well relative positioning is different than absolute positioning in the idea that instead of moving it absolutely from the top left point right here it moves it in relation to where it would normally be so instead of having the origin right here in moving 60 down 30 across the origin is wherever it would be normally which is somewhere right in here and from that point it moves it 60 down and 30 across so that's why it's actually more than 60 pixels down from the very top of your screen again if I was to move this absolutely it would be 60 pixels down from the top and 30 pixels over but since I'm moving it relatively it says alright you start it out well let's go ahead and get rid of this cut this so you start it out right here by default so here is your starting point right here and now you have the CSS rule that says I want to move this 60 pixels down from where I was relative and also 30 pixels over so it's going to take it from right here move it 60 down and 30 over so that's why it ends up right here so anyways that's difference between absolute and relative absolute moves it from the top left point on your screen and relatives move it from where it was in relation to the rest so now you can see that we come across another problem that it doesn't really help - you might be saying art right I'm just going to make everything relative then instead of absolute because relative is better well we come across this from you see instead of just taking this piece out right here in continuing the flow we're first second fourth and said to just moving this fourth up and fill in the gap we now have a space or a gap of where that box used to be right here so with absolute we came across the problem of things overlapping and now relative we come across the problem of whenever we take something out from the natural flow we have a huge gap of where it used to be and it doesn't look like anything really fits in there so anyways keep those in mind whenever you're using these two different types of positioning and by the way let me say this people usually don't layout a webpage all absolute or all relative this isn't like a choice where you choose one or the other yes you can make an entire webpage all absolute or all relative but you usually use them use them in conjunction with one another for example you might have your outside box relative in every inside box inside that would be absolute that is a common technique that people use but anyways I just want to you know get that in your head because in case you thought I was teaching guys the different ways of laying out a website don't think like that think how can I use these techniques together in order to get my webpage the look that I need to achieve so anyways there is one way type of positioning that I'm going to be teaching you guys about and then after that I'm going to show you guys how to tie everything together and give your website the exact look and feel that you guys want and it's going to be awesome you guys are going to be making beautiful websites in no time so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the upcoming videos
