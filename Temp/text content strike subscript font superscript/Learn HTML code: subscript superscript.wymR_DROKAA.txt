hello there today's video is on HTML using a couple of tags that are kind of related so let me open up this plane web pages I've got going here and the idea is you can do let's say you have to do a formula so a squared oh let's do a caps a squared plus B squared equals a squared equals C squared or say for example you need to write something like h2o for uh you know water let's put a break in there but those digits are supposed to be moved around so that's when you actually use some of the tags we're going to talk about today which is a subscript and superscript which will be a sub and we'll do a slash sub oh forgot my slash the B squared is supposed to be the same way sub wait I'm sorry I've got it backwards the the exponents gonna wind up being superscript as its raised so and then the slash sup and then same thing with c-squared sup and then close that slash sup and the same way with the sub script so that'll be a /su be afterwards so /su be so put in a SUV in a slash SUV that save that run it there we go so the superscript will raise it up like an exponent and the subscript will lower it down like that with a two you can actually you can use that with fractions as well let's put in a br and you can put superscript with a too close it and then slash and we'll put a subscript with that three and then slash subscript save that and that should put a two-thirds on there as well so that's a cool way you can make fractions because the text next to it will appear normal let's save that and refresh it so the text next to it will look fairly normal you create fractions in the middle of text or equations or chemical formulas things like that so that's the the subscript to lower it the half a notch like you would in chemical formulas and the supp su P superscript to raise it like you would in exponents and hopefully you'll use this in your scientific webpages and mathematical webpages or just for fun maybe thank you for watching if you've enjoyed the experience of this tutorial why not share it with your friends
