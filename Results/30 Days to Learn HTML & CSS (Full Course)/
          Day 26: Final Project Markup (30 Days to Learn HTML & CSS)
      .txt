now that you've learned the basics of HTML and CSS it's time to start doing what you really want to be doing is building websites so we're going to work together from scratch I have zero notes so you're going to see how I would actually go about converting a Photoshop design into a real website so for our design I visited themeforest.net this is a place you can go to purchase themes anything from a wordpress theme to a HTML and CSS theme and you can also purchase PSD s and that's what I like to do if you're not much of a designer you can come here find the PSD s and buy PSD I mean Photoshop files for design convert it yourself and then you don't have to worry about your design skills so this one was created by Collis to eat coincidentally he is the CEO of Envato so if we want to take a look at what we're getting you see it's very simple it looks like it's a grid-based but it's nice and clean and perfect for what we need so I will now purchase this and I'm going to use my prepaid credit because I already have an account with ThemeForest next I'm going to open up the zip file that I received and you can see he has a handful of files here now he has white and black themes we're not going to do black I'm going to stick with white so let's take a look at each one here's the homepage services and work so let's start simply by converting home so now to keep this cohesive I'm going to open up our new project directory where I have the basic skeleton that we've learned to use I'm going to create a new folder called PSD s that way we can always refer to them and I'll take these and drag them in there we are and now we're all set to get going so these next tutorials are going to assume that you do have Photoshop Adobe Photoshop installed it's not free however if you visit Adobe comm and browse to the download section you can get a 30-day trial if you don't have it but want to work along and if you do intend on sticking with web design I really really recommend that you go ahead and make that purchase even though it is expensive because it is the default for all web signers so first I'm going to take home that PSD and open it in Photoshop now don't worry if you don't have much experience with Photoshop I'm going to work through each step but I will assume you have a modest understanding of for example the move tool will allow me to move my canvas and things like that so if you're not familiar with it just follow along and it should begin to click eventually so the way we convert a PSD to HTML is first we don't slice anything out we begin by creating our HTML as we always have so this is a good point to start analyzing how we would create the markup for this as I see things we have a header at the very top we do have a wrapper because notice this entire website is centered as we've learned to do so it makes sense to have some kind of wrapper and then the header and we could include this part with the header as well it's just up to us and then we have a some information about services they offer and then finally at the bottom we have a footer so notice this is a very common layout you have your header you have maybe a banner and then you have some information below and your footer this is quite common for all websites so you should get used to it fairly quickly so let's get started I'm going to open up our project within sublime and we have a blank slate the first step is to create the mark-up and we're going to take advantage of Zen coding which I taught you in a previous lesson if you're also working along in sublime text and you have Zen coding and slow you can press ctrl option Enter and that's going to bring up this panel right here and what's nice about this is you can write your Zen coding but it is displayed on the page in real time so you know exactly what you're getting for example if I type ul Li you see that it's updating instantly so let's get started we're going to begin by building a div with a class of container let's refer back and within here we're going to have a header element we know that for sure so let's do that header and within the header element we have an h1 tag that says black and white so we'll do h1 black plus white and then he also has a navigation section and we're going to place that within the header as well so we're going to create a sibling to the h1 notice if I did this it would add in the h1 but we need a sibling now we know an Ave will contain a list of navigation links so I will add a ul and within the list item here he has one two three four five he has five list items and each list item of course this should be clickable because it's a link so we'll place an anchor tag that links to nowhere for the time being and that looks good for now so I will hit enter for that to take effect and now I can tab through each one of these I'm going to fill these in really quickly so good we are done with the wrapper and the header but we should probably place these two images within it as well now how do you convert images that have text because we wanted to be searchable so in this case he has a background image but for our project we're going to use HTML to add the text within it so really we just need a section for the image so for the time being right after the navigation we'll have a image but I would like to be able to target it and because it's the only image within the header maybe we can leave it blank for now but if we need to be more specific we can always add a class later and then next right here this is blank and that means it could be anything it could be another stock photo it could be anything at all he's left it blank for this case so we will as well the next step is to work on our main content area so let's use that keyword main I'm going to create a new div with a class of main and within it we have three columns essentially so why don't we separate these and we'll say each one will have a div and we'll give the class of grid and because we know that we're going to use eventually the 960 framework which we discussed and that's 12 columns we can figure this out on our own even though we haven't yet implemented the 960 framework let's consider this it's not divided into thirds because these two right here are much wider than this one so why don't we consider maybe rather than each column being a grid 4 4 1 3 4 times 3 is 12 why don't we say 5 5 that's 10 and then we need 2 more which is 12 and we can play around with it if we need to so let's say grid 5 and why don't we create two of those now within each one is going to be a h1 tag and I'm going to leave that blank and then after that we have just some gibberish text so I will add a paragraph after each one as well and I'm going to hit enter so I can tab through these first we have services we offer and within here we're going to add some lorem text and the same thing for how we work notice it's just a matter of going back and forth and converting it so now let's do this last one and this is a quote so I can either press the letter T or click right here to select the text tool and I will click and highlight that so I can copy it and now we're going to create another div and we're going to try out grid 2 though that might still be a little bit too short but we'll play around with it and this grid is going to contain a block quote and within the block quote we'll have a paragraph tag that contains that text like so isn't sin coding really neat after the block quote we have some information about who said it but we're going to come back to that shortly and then if we come back here we have read more buttons under each column so we'll add those as well we'll place that with on a paragraph tag and it will be a link read more and because I know I want to style these especially I'm going to apply a class of button like so next I'm going to come down and paste it for the next grid notice I haven't yet even looked at this in the browser I don't need to now we're going to copy this and why don't we just grab all of this text and place it in like so and because he had two paragraphs I'm going to make sure that I do the same as well there we are that looks clean and he has the exact same thing for the second column so we'll do it once again and I'll copy and paste that in and in this case it looks like he has one more at the bottom it doesn't really matter this is dummy text it's simply a way to represent what a real website would look like alright and that section is done so now let's take care of the footer and all he has here is black and white themes via theme forest so we'll place this at the bottom right here now I want you to notice can you see how very quickly once you have lots of dibs it can be difficult to determine which div is closing which and that's why we use indentation because I can easily tell that this div is the closing div for this one however if you need more perhaps you can't see what this one closes you're always welcome to add comments and we do that with this syntax and within the middle you can say in the container this is purely preference I sometimes do it if I find that I'm forgetting what a closing element is now right here let's add our footer and within the footer I'll scroll down just a touch we are going to have a simple paragraph tag that contains that text what we can see here is should black and white be clickable I don't know we would have to ask the client but it is bold so we're going to make that strong and then likely theme force is a website so we should make that clickable so first I will wrap that and we do know where that one's going so we can put in the link right now themeforest.net next black and white we decided should be strong so I will wrap that within strong tags as well and we do need to add this text right here some slick phrase would go in here to sum up what the business actually does and stands for so let's come back to the top and because we know this section is sort of a banner why don't we wrap it within a div and within here just to begin I'm going to have a paragraph tag and what does the paragraph say this text right here and there we are and then rather than using an image here why don't we apply this big image as a background because it's really not important to the website it's a background so let's remove that entirely now just as we noted that each of these sections right here is a grid we can tell that this one right here is the width of both of these grids below combined and we hypothesize that each of these is grid 5 so that would mean this would be grid 10 so for now let's add that in an addition to banner we'll give it a class of grid 10 and we also know from working with 960 in the previous lesson that the wrapping class should be container 12 then after this we can have our empty box and we'll place it right after it div grid 2 and we'll just leave that blank because presumably it would be filled with some text or images or links but we don't know what it is for our hypothetical clients so we're going to leave it blank and then they can tell us later all right so this looks good for our home page we did it fairly quickly now it's the point when we get to view it in the browser sir and here we are and you can see nice and clean markup looks perfect this is what you want to see because you always think if I were to disable CSS and JavaScript and images would my website still be understood by the reader and in this case absolutely so in the next lesson we're going to get started slicing our PSD
