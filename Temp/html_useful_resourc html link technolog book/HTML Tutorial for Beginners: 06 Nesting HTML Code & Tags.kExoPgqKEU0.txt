hey this is Sasha and thanks for joining me here for another training video and today we're covering some more HTML today what I'd like to do is take a look at nested elements so nested elements are basically elements that are within one another in a mess so when you think about it something that's inside of another element so it's basically one is a parent and one is a child now you've already seen this already but as we get into more formatting tags here shortly it's important to understand how nested elements work and how deep you can really go with them so let's take a look at some nested elements here alright so you can see here we have our basic website or web page now I did add a few of the comments there and if we get rid of some of these comments here you'll actually see that we do have a few nested elements some of the nested elements that we actually have in fact right here when you look at it which is an element within an element you can see the heading tag right there is the parent and then within the heading tag we have a title tag which is the child okay so this is actually a nested element so you can see how it's creating a little nest right and we have the same thing if you take a look at the body right here here's our body tag and then within here we have the P tag right here this tag that's a nested element this is a nested element this is a nested element within it and that's a nested element within it now you could go even deeper within that and put a nested element within a paragraph tag or a heading tags such as bolding something like let's say you wanted to bold the word hyper drive right here you could go ahead and do that but you can see all of this is really nested if we really look at the bigger picture it's all nested by this HTML tag okay now the only thing that isn't nested really is this doctype so you can see how this things really works so neither case you can continue to go things deeper and continue to mess things further and further but what's important to understand is that you're always looking at where the opening and closing tag is because you don't want to be confused at you know you don't want to mix messed things up so in other words which you don't want to do is go ahead and put your body tag somewhere over here and you know you have this element over here and you take the paragraph tag and maybe you put it somewhere down here because now that doesn't go with the flow okay so if I go ahead and save this and we'll go ahead and take a look at our page you can see the paragraph tag is off because there's two of them right there the body is closing up here it doesn't go with the right flow now even if you look at this page it's not that complicated right now so it doesn't cause a lot of problems but later eventually this could give you a lot of problems for example if I take this h2 tag and I go ahead and put that all the way down here towards the bottom and I go ahead and save that and now we take a look you can see that it actually creates an h2 view for that whole paragraph so that's ultimately where the problems start to lie so if I go ahead and backtrack this you want to make sure you keep things very nice and clean when you're doing nesting and putting in tags within tags especially as you get into bolding things because what we're going to talk about here in the next section is if I go ahead and add let's say the strong tag or a bold tag and I you know bold hyper drive right here I'll go ahead and save it so you can take a quick look at how that's going to look I'll go ahead and refresh and you can see that right there as you look at the page hyper drive is bold it so you can see how that works out really well and nicely up but as you can see that tag right there is nested within the paragraph tag so if I really look at it okay we have the paragraph tag right there and the strong or the bold is nested inside of that and we also have the paragraph tag that's nested within the body tag so that's what it's important for you to understand is that you can continue to dig deeper and deeper into the nest and if I really wanted to let's say the drive and I wanted to make it italics and we're going to do the emphasize tag right here then I'll go ahead and save it and it'll just show you right there as I refresh you can see I have Drive italic and bold I messed it with in there so these things can go on for quite a while depending on how much code you have and what's inside which element but ultimately this gives you a starting point to understanding how the nesting function works when it comes to these tags and what it is that you're looking for when you're creating proper nesting sequences in your HTML tags thanks for joining me in
