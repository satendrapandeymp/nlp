what is going on guys welcome to your 33rd XHTML and CSS story and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about something called pseudo elements but the name pseudo element I don't know why they give that name because it's not really even a fake element at all it's basically just a piece of another element so for example um a pseudo element for example might be if you have a paragraph it might just be the first line of the paragraph or if you have a header it might just be the first letter of that title or whatever section of text yet so you see it's not really like a fake element it's just like the beginning of another element so I know you guys it's really hard to explain it so I'm just going to show you guys what it is so let's go ahead and make three paragraphs because I'm going to be styling the first letter of each paragraph so you know might as well have more than one so um just go ahead and make three outlines four paragraphs right now pp heads disgusting and paste and paste so let's just go ahead and alright what's popping in my head Paul did you hear Miley Cyrus played beer pong with the Russians yeah I never took typing class as a kid so yeah and then just write something in next one like OMG WUF barbecue and in the last one just write like Oh Billy Oh Billy okay so anyways let's go ahead and save that and take a look at what we got it so far three paragraphs basically pretty dumb so anyways what I wanted to teach you guys is about these pseudo elements and how to apply styles to them first of all a pseudo element would be the first letter of each of these paragraphs and you don't get to pick on these pseudo elements they're actually built-in and the ones that are built-in I know by heart our first letter first-line for example if you add a paragraph with like five lines it would only apply the style to that first line and there's also one be called there's also one book called the heck my st. there's also one called before and after and actually never use these so I'm not even entirely sure that they are but I know that they exist because I read about it before so anyways what I'm going to be doing is applying a style to the first letter of each paragraph and in order to use these pseudo elements you do this go ahead and type the main element that you want to apply and then go ahead and add a colon and type the name of the pseudo element now in this case its first - letter and again you don't get to make these up these are actually built-in so again there's first letter and first-line before and after so now whenever I apply a style it's going to apply it to the first letter of every paragraph so let's go ahead and well let's go ahead and make a style so font-weight:bold good and on but like font size 30 pixels I always choose 30 pixels I'm not sure why and just make it color green that looks pretty good and from that semicolon instead of colon now refresh it and let's see we got now we have a style apply to the first letter of the first paragraph P oh and oh and it's supposed to so that's pretty nice so anyways that's what pseudo elements are and that's how you can use CSS to apply styles to them now again in this example it wasn't really useful but uh you know you get the idea if you ever want to apply a style to make the first letter or first line stand out this is how you do that so nice that's all I got for you guys for the story thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next video
