hey YouTube how's it going its Quinton here and this is tutorial number 47 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about check boxes and radio buttons now most of you guys probably already know what a check box is it's just one of those boxes that you click on it and it's checked and if you click on it again it's unchecked ok so quite simple and a radio button pretty much works the exact same way except that a radio button can only have one of the option selected whereas a check box could have many options selected and we'll get into that later on in the tutorial but for now let's actually put some checkboxes on our page so we're going to have to ask the user a question and it could be a question that requires multiple answers or multiple choices so let's say I ask the user what are you most likely to do in your spare time so what do you do in your spare time ok and we could give them a couple options yeah so I'm actually going to put a break tag there just for display purposes but we can give them a few different options so we can say play sport ok and that can be a checkbox so to add a checkbox on to our page we're going to add an input with a type equal to checkbox and this will make sure that our input element is actually rendered as a checkbox then as usual we have to give our checkbox a name so I'm going to give this a name of I don't know spare time so we'll go spare underscore time and the reason why we give every checkbox a name is because whenever we're sending these values back to our server then we want to send through a name to identify the value that was checked and in the case of a checkbox we might often send through more than one so you might very often especially in the case with PHP C people give their checkboxes a name that actually has little square brackets here on the end and that's got to do with programming so I'm not really going to cover that here but you might actually see that happen sometimes so just you know take note of that so we'll send through a value of we'll send through a name of spare time but what do we want to send through as a value well of course the value we're going to put in as an attribute and the value is basically what we're going to send as programmers or as designers back to the server because the user gets to see this part they get to see that they're taking the option for playing sport but we get to decide on our and actually what value we want to send back so this is a little bit different to a textbox whereas you guys can remember a value for a textbox actually determined what was going to be displayed inside of that textbox now so this is a little bit different to that and we'll just give this a value of sport okay and we could probably end this off right there so that is one option let's go ahead and make a few more so we can say play sport we can also say play computer games or something and the last option just something kind of girly will say shopping okay and then we'll send this as games and this as shopping so we're just changing these values now if we were going to send all of these back to the server like this we might want to give each one a different name otherwise we'd be doing something like this we'd use the same name but we would put in the square parentheses and this basically old it is determined by whatever server-side scripting language you're using whether it be PHP or Python or something like that so it also depends on what the programmer would like these names to be so you might want to just find out from him whenever you're actually naming your elements yeah I kind of kind of hit a blank there I didn't know what I was saying but anyways let's go ahead now and save this and actually take a look at what this looks like in the browser so we got to go over there and just run this in Firefox and as you can see we now have a question for the user so why do you do in your spare time and they can tick play sport play computer games or shopping and as you can see we're able to select multiple checkboxes we could just send through two or one or we could send through all three and that would be fine okay and the user could actually choose to send through no values at all but we might decide that we want something to be checked by default so whenever you want an option to be checked by default you can add in this attribute which is checked and you can just set that equal to checked and this will basically tell HTML or tell the browser okay this option needs to be checked by default so it won't actually work if I just refresh this I'm going to have to run it in Firefox and new and as you can see whenever the user actually first loads this page they're going to have place port ticked by default okay so now we've talked about checkboxes for so long it's time to actually move on to radio buttons and I don't think I'm going to delete all of this code we'll leave that there as it is but we'll add in I think to break tags over here so maybe just highlight this and hit ctrl D and that's going to duplicate it once and that means we should at least have a little bit of space between our checkboxes and our radio buttons now radio buttons can only have one option ticked at a time or checked at a time so whenever we group radio buttons together we have to give them the same name because that's how the browser knows that they're all part of one group and it also that's how the browser knows that only one of those items is supposed to be checked okay so let's give our radio or let's put some radio buttons on the page and in order to do that let's just ask a yes/no question so do you play League of Legends and that's pretty much my go-to question whenever I can talk about radio buttons it's kind of funny in this bin my PHP tutorial I did that as well so yeah okay and we're going to give the user the option to say they do play League of Legends so yes and just for display purposes we need to add a break tag there and I'm going to give and oh I'm going to put in an input element over here of type equal to radio and that is going to make this actual input element a radio button and then we're going to give that a name and we're going to set that equal to plays low just because that's the first thing I came to mind I guess and then I'm going to give this a value of yes so keep in mind that this works exactly the same as a checkbox that we decide what value we want to send through to the server so whenever the user takes this option then we know that we're going to send through the value yes because the user can see this word over here yes okay so they do indeed trust that they're sending through the value yes and it's going to send through with a name of place law now we obviously also want to give them an option to say no and we're going to change the value to no but make sure that the name is the same because if you guys give each one of these radio buttons a different name then it's not going to group them in the form and you might be able to select more than one at a time and radio buttons are meant to only have one ticked so let's go back here and click refresh and as you can see we've got our second question over here do you play League of Legends and the user can either tick yes or they can tick no but as soon as we take No then yes is not checked and as soon as we tick yes then no is not checked so we can only have one of these selected at a time and again if you want one of those selected by default whenever the user browses your website or whenever they first visit your website then you can just add in this attribute here which is checked is equal to checked and that will just make sure that by default whenever the user first loads this page in their browser that yes is actually checked and you know if I want to be 100% accurate I should actually run that in Firefox again so there we go and that's all I have for you guys
