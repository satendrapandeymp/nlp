in this video we're going to take a look at how to nest columns inside other columns in bootstrap and it's actually not that hard once you get the concept down that's really all it is now let's go ahead and load up our web page so what we want to do is go ahead and nest some columns inside of this main column so that's what we're going to do so we're gonna go right here of course here is our div for our main columns we want to nest it within this div right here so we're going to go ahead and create some space here and we're gonna do it right after this text this main call text so we're gonna go ahead and hit enter and make some space so there we go so what we want to do now is place some new columns in here that's exactly what we want to do now the first thing we need to do is create another row right because we know that rows organize our columns so we just go ahead and copy and paste that up here and we're going to create another div we got to close it out so let's just do that real quick and there you can see we've got our row now now we can go ahead and start to create our columns so let's go ahead and just copy this column right up here and we're just gonna go ahead and copy and paste this right into here there we go so now we've got our first column so let's size this and let's actually make this an MD for now keep in mind this will scale to the size of our main column and bootstrap handles that for you so basically this MD 4 would be a different size if it was outside of our MD 6 column but since it's inside here it'll scale to this MD 6 just wanted to let you know that okay now let's go ahead and we're gonna create a different class and we're gonna call this inside 4 column inside so that's what we're going to name our class and for the text let's just call this inside column that works okay so let's go ahead and save this and now let's open up our style sheet and then what we want to do is just go ahead and create some rules here for our new class and so we'll just go ahead and copy and paste out here and remember that was call inside good and we don't need margin let's get rid of that we'll set the minimum height to 100 pixels will Center the text we'll continue doing that and let's go ahead and set the color to orange okay so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and see what we get hey good look at that now you might be wondering well why do we have all this gray space here keep in mind this is a row with columns so if you want this column larger you could make this an MD 8 9 10 11 12 - size it all the way and let's let's do that let's go ahead and do that right now so let's set this to a 12 and this should scale the entire remember that's as far as you can go 12 I believe so let's go ahead and save that and let's rerun this there take a look now that column goes all the way across that basically means hey set the width at a hundred percent of this main column now you could say hey I'm done that's fine that's all you want and that's great but what if you want to add multiple columns here well it's pretty simple right you could actually create another row in here like we did with our main page but let's go ahead and set this back to four and let's go ahead and copy and paste this in a couple times now oops we just need all of this right here I know this is not aligned but I'm just sort of moving along here pretty quick well let's go ahead and just copy and paste this twice over so we'll go ahead and one more paste after this and let's go ahead and save this and now we should have three columns in there let's take a look take a look at that we've got three columns now and they are all sized appropriately so again it's sort of the same concept that we've been talking about when you play around with the size of the columns you just use that number at the end of the class four or five six seven eight whatever you want you can go ahead and arrange these in whatever manner you want okay so that's how you nest columns in bootstrap
