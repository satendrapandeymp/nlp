either this is a Michigan sorry so in this tutorial we are going to learn about how to link to a specific section or a bookmark in another page okay so the last lessons in our HTML series in my tutorial channel we have learned about how to make bookmarks between page and so if we want to target a bookmark in another page so we will learn how to do that okay so first and foremost I have great deposits here and all as HTML hyperbole 4 and I just had a small in text or HTML page okay so if you run this page nothing excited happens here just it displays a blank HTML dot HTML file okay so here I am using a red beans which is a chrome is connected to this type beans ID so whatever the changes I make here so automatically reflected in that curved page there okay so just I am having a just having a title here or I am saying it as books home page okay so just kept a title here so title has appeared in our web page okay so here the idea is so I have I will create another web page here okay so I did let me say that let me take another HTML file here let me say that as book 1 dot HTML okay so book 1 dot HTML so here the idea is so here the user or a programmer or is creating a number of books here okay so here so I just have a book 1 dot HTML and this book 1 has so many chapters ok and each and every chapter will have a bookmark so from that index dot HTML page we will directly jump to this book one particular bookmark in this book one dot HTML ok so for that let me clear everything here all the meta tags and all not quite useful for us at this stage so I'm just taking it off okay I'm just giving the tech let's book one so imagine that there is an order who is reading a books and so on and so forth okay so herd element it's being closed here okay title without much detecting motion right here okay so here oh so I am just putting a heading h1 or first let me have piety here let me say OOP one ok so just putting a heading here ok so book one and let me align that to center here ok so for that looking use this style attribute here so style is equal to so side is equal to text - line Center ok so I'm just using a CLS CSS property using the center value so if you go back to your chrome nothing happens here just letting go over the full screen here ok so if you go back to your chrome nothing excited happen here happen here because if you make a link of this page in that index dot HTML then you can navigate from here to there okay so further I'm using an H ref here so a H is equal to H ref is equal to so automatically our book one dog HTML will show up here okay so book one dot HTML and let me close that anchor tag and let me say that one I just made a bookmark here ok so go back to your chrome ok so go get your chrome here so I just made a book one bookmark okay so if you click on that book work nothing happens here it just navigates to another web page which is book 1 dot HTML ok so we come back to our book OneNote HTML so let us make some change here let us say something like this let us make the particular or bgcolor so please equal that sort of good practice to use basically we need to change so that one color using so let me see think or something like this ok so pink or something like this let me close the thing ok so I will go back to your page thing has been changed here also navigate from here to here so you might get the feel of the change that page has been changed okay so no here what I'm doing is let me take another h1 tag okay so let me fill the page with a huge content key okay so you chapter one and let me take a paragraph here let me put some dummy text here because basically I'm not a writer so let me I don't write books here so for the purpose I'm just taking a load on it some text okay so just to fill fill up the web page with a huge content so that we can we could make some book plus okay so to go to Wikipedia or something like this so get this dummy text of lorem ipsum so it is very quite commonly used in website development to have that w calculate just have copied that content come back to your chrome so let me paste it a couple of times such that you get the feel if something has been written here okay so to go back to your the HTML page and click on the book 1 so here you get okay the chapter 1 there is some whole whole lot of content here okay so in that way let us so fill up this HTML page so let me take another h1 tag let me say something like this chapter 2 or something like this and let me put another paragraph tag here put another paragraph tag and keep on filling a couple of times here okay so like this I would make up to ten chapters here okay so h1 let me say chapter three okay so for five or six chapters will have s that will get the real feeling of the bookmark this is jumping from top to bottom like this okay chapter three is ten but let us have another h1 here the chapter four chapter four because s let us have the paragraph once again so paragraph tag to just put the dummy content here okay chapter for the demo chapter for that let us have another h1 let's see so chapter 5 the ser the paragraph tag once again here let's put the dummy quadrant once again a couple of times chapter 5 the tender terrifyingly the scale chapter 6 chapter 6 I'm gonna share this paragraph once again place a couple of times okay so they have enough with copy paste and safety observe here the chrome automatically synchronizes with my inner greens code whatever whatever I'm upgrading here okay so go back to your the original home page here and if you click on the book one icon so what happens is automatically it takes you that page and it has got some double counting here okay so if you want to navigate directly to chapter six okay so you can make a bookmark of this in that home page somewhere around here okay so for that purpose let me make a bookmark it so good my our NetBeans here so what my index dot HTML so before that let me say that in this h1 so we need to make an ID here okay so we are going to that ID we are going to use that ID in our okay so I just made an ID of h6 here okay so for this ID we are going to make a bookmark know his next thought HTML okay so let us take a beer tag here and let us make some body color for this also it's not it's going to make it as yellow or something like this VG color is equal to L oh so on a good practice to use all these things let us make this also line style is equal to text - lines Center process that is the title okay okay so let us also make the text size also text size of the size let us increase the size also is equal to let us make it s some text icon size is equal to Rho so 400 percent or something like this so correlations and that's sinkhole okay so go back to your page here if you reload it once again you didn't get it fit really okay so 400 percent must be within the quotations here okay the text type from size is equal to sitting okay so just let a mistake here used to stick size and size when it is fall - says here okay so made a small mistake here okay so you're very careful about the CSS properties and their values while writing a written the inline HTML 9 within the text or HTML okay so we have just increase the size to foreign person just align the text to center here too mixed to make a small difference okay so we click on the book 1 it automatically navigates to that page but if I want it to go directly to the 6th chapter so for that purpose I need to make a link here or make a bookmark in the home page here okay so for that purpose we'll go to that home page once again so here I'm making an anchor tag a H is equal to H stuff is equal to so if I say automatically is equal to is showing a book 1 or HTML automatically osso bucco not HTML hash c6 ok so 3 6 because there we have taken there you have taken a c6s ID for that chapter 6 here Chris o book 1 chef ok that's what I'm using here as a bookmark here so if you go back to your chrome so automatically the link has been appeared here okay so click on that link so automatically jumps back to the chapter 6 here okay so in the same way so if you want a book work for chapter 4 can make that also so it take something like this BR and if you take another a history of HF is equal to book or not HF is equal to book 1 dot HTML that means convert HTML and let me say that hash c4 okay so we will make that re also available there or I can say book 1 chef for okay so book 1 and check for here okay so so go back to that book 1 dot page and if you navigate to the fourth chapter and let me let us make the ID as c4 k so ID is equal to c4 okay so here we have you have an ID of c4 and you based on that ID you have created a bookmark here using a head trip to that particular section here okay so if you say everything go back to your Chrome the link automatically ABS here go back to a chrome reload the page so here you have the link for book 1 chapter 4 if you click on that so automatically it takes you to the chapter 4 section ok so this is the way so it is the way so you can create as many as books you can in subsequent pages and you can have your bookmarks and directly gems to that page automatically ok so here the first bookmark it's jumps to chapter 6 here in the second bookmark I have made here for chapter 4 and one or something like this ok so hope this tutorial helped you so please put your valuable feedback in the form of comments so see you in the next lesson goodbye
