hello everybody in previous videos I showed how to send an email through Microsoft Excel VBA but using Microsoft Outlook and in the previous videos I showed how to do a mass email just how to send one email and how to personalize an email but what I did not show is how to send an email using the HTML body property pretty much being able to send an email with HTML in it and so I'm just going to briefly explain the code that I have in front of me right now this basic code right here is just sending an email out through Microsoft Outlook you know we have the Microsoft Outlook window open right here and this is where we had the send mass email which would go through all of the emails that we had on our worksheet and it would send a personalized message it would replace replace name here with the name and the promo code would be replaced with the promo code in this line but at this point I have removed all the emails that I have here I only have one address which is going to be mine and so I'm going to do is send out one email and it's going to be through HTML gen just I'm just going to give you a real quick demonstration I'm not going to be too complex with the HTML the name I'm going to make it bold and to do that I'm just going to use the strong tag that make sure you close it out and then I'm also going to do the same thing for the promo code I'm just going to use the strong tag and I'm going to put this here because this is I'm changing the message to send because this is the text that we use to actually generate the email body as you can see we have the male body message right here we declare it first off starting with j2 and all we do is replace the name and the promo code with these variables right here which is what we have in this table but again I mean right now if if this is the first video that you're watching this may sound confusing this is video 4 or 4 I mean I would highly recommend looking at the previous videos regarding the Microsoft Outlook email in VBA that way you can follow what this code is doing but what I'm going to do here is change this code so that we can actually use the HTML body property it's quite simple the only thing that we have to do different is under oh L mail we need to put all L mail that body format is equal to and the format that we're going to use I mean these are the options that we have here but the one that we're going to use for HTML is going to be oh L format HTML and under Oh L mail dot body that's going to change it's no longer going to be body instead it's going to be dot HTML body these are really the two changes that you need to make in order to send an email with HTML so let's go on and try this out and run this code let me go to macros and I'm going to run send mass email even though it's just one email we're just going to run it and this is the message that we're going to be putting in the email box it's going to be hello strong Alex gone through strong closing out that tag this is just a mass email test welcome to the club your promotional code is and then ABC 1 3 4 again that should be bold because it's in the strong tag it's complete so let's go ahead and pull up Microsoft Outlook here's it the tests email that I just sent and there you have it you see hello and then Alex come through is bold and then your promo code ABC 1 3 4 is bold as well that now concludes this video thank you for watching you
