hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number three and in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to use an HTML validator so whenever you're following along with my tutorials and you're so confused because nothing's working and like you think you type the exact same thing as me but it's just not working you don't know why then and that's when you use an HTML validator I know sometimes people like to panic and act like it's the end of the world because they think they typed the exact same thing as me but there was like a silly little mistake somewhere maybe they forgot a closing slash on a tag or something like that so in order to check for HTML errors we use this thing called an HTML validator and I've got the same document open as the previous tutorial but what I want to do now is actually validate this code because I think there might be an error here and to do that go over to your browser and you can google HTML validator or you can go to this link which I will leave in the description of the video so go ahead and check that out and this is a website by w3c now I won't go into too much detail about this but w3c is basically the organization that is in charge of the standards for HTML so these guys are the ones who decide what is right when it comes to HTML and what is wrong and yeah I'd say you can at least trust their HTML validator because there are the guys who set this kind of rule so do do your homework on them if you're interested but I want to validate my files so I'm going to validate by file upload you can also validate by URI which means I mean you can like copy someone's URL paste it in here and check there's any errors you know but for now we are just working with the files on my computer which in this case is this index file that we created so let me go ahead and select that file on my computer so in htdocs' h index dot HTML open that up and hit check and so the validator is going to run through the code on or in my file and find an error for some reason my internet is slow tonight so just gonna have to deal with this okay so you'll see right now I have one error in my document and the error is the character encoding was not declared proceeding using Windows one two five two so if you ever see that you've got an error you might want to just copy and paste this into Google you will definitely find a solution to your problem there is no error that would be undocumented so just go ahead and copy and paste the error into Google to find out what your problem is in this case I already know what my problem is the problem is that the character encoding was not declared so that is something that I need to jump back over my document over here and just type in or add an extra tag so a character encoding if you guys don't know what that is basically just tells the browser what characters we're going to be using on our website and by default this has preceded using Windows one two five two I don't want to use that I want to use something called Unicode and Unicode is just supposed to support all or most of the characters it's like a new world standard to support most characters so for example things like the O with the two dots above it that o with M lots that may not be supported by some character sets but then supported by others so the one that I want to use will support most characters so to to fix this error I'm going to add in a meta tag so I'm just going to type in mater and hit enter and this is going to autocomplete a tag for me that is a bunch of new stuff over here because we've got a maida tag but then it's got this little extra bit of green information and an equal sign and some other information so let me explain what this is right this entire thing is a tag this thing over here is an attribute right so an attribute is a little bit of extra information that this tag can provide and then we have an equal sign and then a value for the attribute so in this case our attribute is char set which stands for character set and we're setting our char set equal to utf-8 which basically is the code for unicode and this will now mean that our website can support pretty much most characters out there okay so now that unicode is or now that our website is unicode i'm going to go ahead and hit save and come back over to the HTML validator and then let me just check this one more time and now you can see that we have no errors in our document so i have officially fixed my error by just adding in this little meta tag and all web sites are actually supposed to have a character set declared so i should have already put this in in the previous tutorial but I didn't know T me and now it's here so we can continue and I'll see you in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth
