hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 25 and in this tutorial we are going to continue talking about some more pseudo classes because I didn't get to cover them all in the previous tutorial and if you guys are wondering why this text looks all big and bolded I don't know if you guys can see it or not but I actually I'm recording more of my screens so that the video will be available in 720p and what this means though is that I had to actually zoom in on this text because otherwise by default it would be all the way back there I think actually over there and that actually looks kind of small you guys probably can't really see it so I zoomed in a little bit just to make it a little bit more clear if you guys are not watching full screen and you are actually watching on the standard YouTube player so yeah I just am recording at a bigger screen and I just zoomed in so if you guys are wondering what's different then that is what's different okay so now let's go ahead and start talking about some of our pseudo classes and the first pseudo class that I want to talk to you guys about is the first child pseudo class and obviously because that is a child we have to work with a parent element as well so let's go ahead and create a div and this will act as our parent and I'm actually going to give this div and ID of parent okay and then I'm going to go ahead and throw in a few paragraphs inside of this div so I'm going to go ahead and actually duplicate that four times and in the previous tutorial I think we worked with like yellow so you only live once then that kind of went into Yolo so we'll go ahead and just use this again go ahead and save that now and again if I were to go ahead and run this in Firefox right now we just get four normal paragraphs so let's just launch it quickly as you can see four normal paragraphs but now let's go ahead and actually style them or style the first child and if you guys don't know what the first child is going to be it's going to be this first paragraph because this paragraph is a child of our parent div element so I'm going to go ahead and select that div by ID so parent and that's basically my parent now I have to tell CSS what child I'm going to be looking for because I might have paragraph tags in here I might have some header tags in here or something like that so I just have to tell HTML which actual element I want to work with so I'm going to go ahead and grab the paragraph and then we'll put in our code on over here and type in first child and that should give us access to just the first paragraph so we won't be styling all the paragraph tags inside of our parent element element just the first one so let's go ahead and give that a color of red and maybe text underline or actually text decoration sorry of underline text-decoration:underline so now when I go ahead and save this and click refresh over here I get our first paragraph appearing in red text and it's underlined okay then the next pseudo class I wanted to mention to you guys was the last child so all we have to do is actually just change first child to last child and when I go over here and click refresh instead of the word you being read and underlined we'll get once so how cool is that now instead of our first child we've selected the last child okay so that's quite simple and now let's go ahead and actually take a look at two different pseudo classes and that is the before and after so before and now go ahead and select the same thing so parent P after and we'll do something here as well okay now this by itself isn't actually going to grab any of these paragraphs so let me go back here oops back there I mean okay when we're selecting the before and after class we're not actually selecting any of these elements we're actually selecting just before this tag so parent P before would mean this little space before the paragraph of our actual paragraph but as long as it's inside of our div parent and it's going to select pretty much the space between all of these paragraphs before and then the second parent P after that we'll select the space after all of these paragraphs and something we can do over here is go ahead and just add in a bit of content using this content property okay so basically if I type something in between these two correlation marks it's actually going to appear as plain text in that space like I said so let's go ahead and type in maybe just I am b4 and if I go ahead and save this now and go back here and click refresh you can see it says I am before in front of our actual paragraph and it actually kind of looks weird because this I am before you I am before only mmm I didn't actually think about that but yeah okay that's pretty cool so we can actually use CSS to add some content before our paragraph you'll notice I can't actually select it even though I'm trying so yeah it's like just like some plain kind of text stuff again I could go ahead and do this using the after class so let's cut that out and paste that in over here and instead of this content appearing before our paragraphs we'll actually have it appear afterwards so it should have actually said I am after but yeah okay so we've got the text appearing after our actual paragraph and you can use this for a lot of different things I mean I haven't showed you everything that we could do with this like the content property is probably the most useless thing of all but we could use it to clear floating divs and that kind of thing although I haven't actually spoken to you guys about floating divs yet so you probably don't know what I'm talking about but that's actually all I have for you guys in this video so don't forget to subscribe
