in this video we're going to go over a couple of different items we're going to review the hidden class as well as using multiple classes to size your elements for the particular devices so first let's talk about the hidden class and if we take a look at our grid here let's say we have some work to do on this column seven something's wrong with it we need to fix it and so temporarily we just want to go ahead and hide it well we can do that with the hidden class in bootstrap this is very similar to when you hide elements in CSS bootstrap just makes it a little bit easier to do so again we want to just go ahead and hide our column seven so let's flip to our code and all we do is come down here and we're just gonna go ahead and tag on a hidden keyword here which will invoke the hidden class so let's go ahead and save this and let's just make sure that column is no longer there and it isn't take a look at that now let's say that column seven looks okay in our grid in medium-sized and large sized devices but it has a problem when we minimize it when we go down here and we minimize it it doesn't look so good so we only want to minimize it for extra small devices well we can do that as well so we just come here we put in a hyphen and then put in XS for extra small devices now this should only be hidden on small devices or when we are on a small resolution so let's go ahead and save this let's reload this and hopefully this will now load on the medium sized resolution and it does now let's go ahead and minimize it and let's make sure it's gone and it is so that's how that works it's pretty simple so let's go ahead and get rid of this and we're back to normal we'll just go ahead and save to keep everything clean now what we've been doing so far is we've had all of our column size in this medium sized resolution but let's go ahead and load our webpage again so what we've done is everything we've used has been the MD device type for the size of our columns and even when we minimize these these are still in the MD size type now maybe we want these columns let's actually maximize out here maybe maybe we want these bottom columns here to size differently when we go to a smaller device type or a smaller resolution well we can do that using multiple so let's go ahead and do that so let's go ahead and close out of our browser and what we're gonna do is tag on another class here and let's just go ahead and copy and paste this so pasted right here and we're gonna make this extra small and let's set this to six size six and you know what let's go ahead and we'll just go ahead and copy and paste this into all of our columns here and there we go so let's go ahead and do a save now what should happen now is when we're in a larger resolution we'll still get this MD size but when we go to a small device or an extra small resolution we'll get this new column size so let's go ahead and load our page and let's see what we get so there you can see we've got our medium sized column still in this larger resolution that let's go ahead and minimize this and we'll see what we get take a look at that see how that's different now the extra small class that we created is kicking in and these probably size a little bit better for a smaller device type as you can see probably a little bit nicer than these larger columns maybe you want this size alright so that's gonna do it for this video thank you
