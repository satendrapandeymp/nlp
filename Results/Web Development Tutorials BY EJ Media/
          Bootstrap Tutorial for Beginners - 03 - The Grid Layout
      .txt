in this video we're going to talk about the grid layout that you can use in bootstrap and this is really the big piece of functionality that people like to utilize in the bootstrap framework now the first question you might ask is why use a grid layout well the big reason is it provides structure it will provide structure to your layout and you can easily add content now the grid system uses a series of rows and columns to control all of your content and that's the great thing about bootstrap is that its grid layout will adjust perfectly to the width of any browser no matter what device they are using so that's really what's nice about the grid layout they have provided a majority of the CSS to handle all the different types of browsers and devices that will access your website now the other thing that's very nice about the grid layout is it's very easy to maintain you can add or remove content as you please now bootstraps grid system allows up to 12 columns you can put those right across the page at a 12 column layout now usually you won't use twelve columns you'll use something a little bit smaller than that but you can go up to twelve columns individual columns actually if you want to create your web page in that manner now you can also rearrange the size of each one of those grids and we'll get to that later on now we're going to go ahead and start out with a six grid layout in this video so let's waste no time here and let's get going let's go ahead and set up our initial grid layout in bootstrap so let's go ahead and get rid of this h1 element and what we're going to do is add our very first bootstrap class and this is the class you need to start with first it's the container class so let's go ahead and create a div for that and the class that we're going to reference is called container pretty simple now this is a predefined class that bootstrap already provides and it is a requirement you must wrap all of your grids inside this container class the good news is all the CSS has already been done for us this is after all a framework and so we don't have to do anything else and again this will house all the grids that we add now there's two types of classes that you can use here you can use this container class and there's also a container - fluid class but we're going to talk about that later for now we're just going to go ahead and use container class and once again bootstrap provides all the code that we need and this is considered a responsive fixed width container and that's opposite from the container fluid class which contains a full width container but again we'll talk about that later in another video so okay let's go ahead and close out this div now within the container class we need to create a div for the row class so let's go ahead and do that and we just specify row and you know what we didn't close this div down here so let's close that and that closes of course our container div and let's go ahead and close our Road div now as I said the row class is another predefined class in bootstrap that you can use and again it always goes inside the container class so this is sort of the basic framework that you'll have for the bootstrap grid you'll always specify the container class and then you'll put in the row class now the row class will allow us to add our columns which we're going to do in a few minutes so that's basically what it allows us to do so basically we'll add all of our columns inside of our Rope div and then we'll have a very basic grid that we can start to take a look at so let's go ahead and add our very first column so I'm just going to go ahead and copy and paste this in here and of course as usual I will explain it so here is our first grid column that we're going to be adding again we're going to go ahead and use a predefined class now the bootstrap grid has four major classes that you can call and you can see them down here access for phones SM for tablets MD for desktops and LG for larger desktop now we're going to go ahead and use the MD class and this is the format that you always use now I'll explain it now you first have to specify Co l - and that of course is for column that always goes first then you can pick and choose what type of size you want and this again equates to sizes so this excess will be a smaller grid if you put in SM that'll be a little bit larger grid if you put in MD you'll have an even larger grid and the largest grid of course is for larger desktops and again we're going to go ahead and just choose MD now at the end you'll see this number here so even the have different sizes as well and it relates to numbers usually it's one through six six being the largest and one being the smallest now we're going to go ahead and choose two but you could specify a different number depending on the size of the column that you want it so again each one of these classes comes in different sizes and usually it's one through six so again we're going to go ahead and use two so again this is a predefined class we don't even have to add any CSS for this bootstrap handles it for us it will recognize this format so let's go ahead and add six more columns that's what we wanted to do for our grid layout and we'll just copy and paste each one of these in here so we've got six columns and then let's just go ahead and update each one of these appropriately and there we go we've got all these updated and our grid is almost ready to go so let's go ahead and actually do a save now now what I want you to do is go ahead and open up the website folder and I want you to go ahead and create a style sheet you can name it whatever you want and then we're going to go ahead and open that in notepad and we're just going to add a little background to the row and we're just going to use the color of lavender so that's the rule that we need so let's flip back and then we just course need to add an entry to our web page for that new CSS file you didn't think we were going to get away with using all of bootstraps CSS did you we have to add a little bit of ours as well so I'll go ahead and just copy and paste that here and here it is so we're just going to point to that okay now I think we're good to go so let's save this up and let's go ahead and open this up in Chrome and let's see what we get there we go take a look at that we've got our very first grid layout and you can see here's the lavender background we got for the row here are our columns which when we add content to them which we'll get to later they will extend down this way and you can see how it's nice and size look this is our container right here it's containing all of our columns and if we resize it you can see what happens actually rearrange them for a smaller viewport and we'll talk about that in bitte and so that is media queries take a look at that bootstrap is already applying media queries automatically for us depending on the width of the browser and see how that stays nice and aligned very very nice indeed so this is a very basic grid but we are going to add a lot more to this in the next video see you guys
