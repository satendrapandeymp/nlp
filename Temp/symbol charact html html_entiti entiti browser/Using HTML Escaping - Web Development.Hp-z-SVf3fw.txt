all right let's play some of these substitutions in practice alright here we are back in our that simple text file but play HTML file I was playing with before and we're going to we're going to use this because it's a little bit quicker to to demonstrate what I'd like to talk about so I'm going to enter some text so I've typed in some text I save this and I load this in my browser okay so here we are I've loaded this text in my browser and if you remember if I just type in plain text in an HTML file it just shows up as plain text in the browser okay now I'm going to surround this tag with angle brackets and let's see how this renders in our browser when I reload my browser that word HTML disappeared that's because when I put an go brackets around it it turned into a tag and tags don't render in HTML they turn into tags so if we use the escaping we just learned and I replace this less than symbol with our escape which is ampersand LT semicolon and I replace the greater than with ampersand greater than semicolon and I reload this in my browser what we see is the actual text that we were that we wanted to demonstrate which is the actual angle brackets so let's try another quick example of this bar to change the string HTML to the word B or to the letter B and save this and reload in my browser we we now have the B tag if I were to go back to my editor and change these less than and greater than back into the actual less-than and greater-than and reload this in my browser a text turns the bold so if we don't want our HTML to the behave as HTML we need to escape it and if we want it to behave as HTML we don't escape it all right try some escaping on your own so what is the correct way to include the text and first and equals ampersand am p semicolon in rendered HTML so it should look like this once it's rendered in the browser what do we need to include in the HTML to get that output
