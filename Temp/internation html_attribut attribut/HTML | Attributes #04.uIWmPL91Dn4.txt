[Music] hello guys welcome back I'm use of Shaquille and you're watching HTML tutorials in this video we are going to learn about HTML attributes so let's get started I have opened brackets and I will go ahead and create a new file and I will save it as attributes dot HTML and I'll go ahead and write the following HTML so we have the doctype opening and closing HTML tag we have the head tag and we have the title tag and it is set to attributes and then we have the body tag now what is an attribute an attribute is a name value pair that we put inside the opening HTML tag so if let us say we have a paragraph tag and if you want to define an attribute then we have to go inside the opening tag and we have to write the attribute name equal to and within double quotes we have to write the attribute value so some value so an attribute will always have an attribute name and an attribute value within double quotes you can also use single quotes but we generally use double quotes so let us begin our journey by writing the language attribute in the opening HTML tag so this is our opening HTML tag and we will write lang and we'll set this to en for English this attribute gives additional information about the HTML element in this case it is telling that the language of this page is English we can set the value of this language attribute to other values like a r4 Arabic hi4 Hindi you are for you do and so on now let us talk about the commonly used HTML attributes and we start with the ID attribute an ID attribute is used to uniquely identify an HTML element so let's say we have paragraph and we give it an ID let's say s - 0 1 and we set the content let's say student name so this HTML element consists of a paragraph tag content and a closing paragraph tag and inside the opening paragraph tag we have the ID attribute and its value is s 0 1 now we use this idea tribute to uniquely identify this element inside this HTML page and no two elements inside this HTML page can have the same ID value in this case s - 0 1 now we can create another paragraph say student address and we can give this paragraph an ID esta 0 1 and if we check the live preview we'll get the output and there will be no error but this is not recommended you should not use the same ID value twice so instead of giving this element an ID s - 0 1 we can write let's say s - 0 1 address and for this we can write s - 0 1 name so the ID attribute is like your school ID no two student can have the same student ID number so likewise no two HTML elements inside a given page can have the same ID attribute value the next most commonly used attribute is the class attribute and it is used to create groups and more than one HTML element can share the same class value so for example let's say we want to create a paragraph and we want to give this paragraph a class having value fruit and let's say we want to save it as apple and then we will create let's say another paragraph and we give it a class fruits and we set it to mango and we create another paragraph and we said its value to fruits and let's say orange so in this HTML page more than one HTML element is having the class value set to fruits so we have created a fruits group so a class is like a group for example we can have a group of math students we can have a group of computer students we can have a group of physics students so each group can have one or more students inside that group similarly inside an HTML page we can have one or more elements sharing the same class value the next attribute that we'll discuss is this style attribute so let us go ahead and create a heading tag h1 and let's say we write hello world and let us write the style attribute inside the opening h1 tag and let's say we want this hello world color blue so we will set the style attribute value to color colon and will write blue and then semicolon so now we have this text in blue color similarly we can create let's say another paragraph and let's say this is a sample paragraph and let's say we want to style this and let's say we want to increase the font size to 120% so we'll set the style attribute value to font size and we'll set this to 120% semicolon so the style attribute is actually used to style the element this type of styling of HTML element is called inline style we'll talk more about styling in the CSS tutorial where we'll cover in detail about the inline style we'll talk about the embedded style and including external style sheets in the HTML file alright let's move on another important attribute is the title attribute and as the name suggests it is used to give title to the HTML element and this title will appear as a tooltip when we move the mouse on top of that element so let us go ahead and create a paragraph and let's say this is another paragraph having title and inside the opening paragraph tag we'll set the title attribute and we'll set the value of this title attribute to let's say hello so now if we move the mouse on top of this paragraph will see the title hello the next attribute that we'll talk about is the H ref attribute and it is commonly used in the anchor tag so let us go ahead and create an anchor tag and inside this anchor let's say we want to write dy classroom dot-com so we are creating a link and inside the opening anchor tag will create the H ref attribute and this attribute will take a value which is generally the link of a web page so in this case HTTP www-why classroom comm so if we click on this link that will take us to a DIY classroom website now say we don't want to set B H to F value but we want a link in that case we generally set the H value to hash so let's say we create another anchor and we say sample link and in this case we set the H Drive value to hash now if we click on the sample link it will not take us anywhere the next attribute is the SRC attribute and it is commonly used in the image tag so let us go ahead and create an image tag and inside this image tag will create the SRC attribute and the value of this SRC attribute is the URL of the image that we want to use in this case I will use the DIY classroom logo URL so in the SRC attribute I'll paste the link and we have this logo the next attribute that we are going to use is the alt attribute and it is commonly used in the image tag so let us go ahead and create an image tag now the value of the alt attribute is shown when the image fails to load so for example let us go ahead and create a SRC attribute and copy-paste this dy classroom image URL and let us go ahead and set the alt attribute to dy classroom logo now if we change this URL to some invalid link let's say one two three then you can see the image is not displayed but we get this DIY classroom logo text which is actually the value of this alt attribute all right guys this brings us to the end of this tutorial I'll post the notes of this tutorial video on my website DIY classroom calm the link will be in the description and the code that we are writing in this tutorial I'll put it in my github repository the link will be in the description so please check that out and if you find this video interesting
