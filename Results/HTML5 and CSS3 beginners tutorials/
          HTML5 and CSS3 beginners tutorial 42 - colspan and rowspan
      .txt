hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 42 and in this tutorial we are going to continue talking about tables and I'm actually going to be talking about colspan and rowspan specifically so colspan and rowspan allow us to make a column that spans over multiple cells or we can go ahead and use rows band to make a row or a henna cell span over multiple rows so by the way that's supposed to make a cell span over multiple columns I might have mixed that up a second ago but yeah okay so now let's go ahead and learn how to do that so I'm going to be using this table which we made in the previous tutorial okay and if you guys don't have this table because you didn't watch the previous tutorial go back and watch that and you'll be good to go so if we take a look at this in the browser we've got something that looks kind of like this where we have our caption and then our table but what I want to do is actually make this caption part of the table so the first thing I'm going to do is make this caption appear in the first row and actually take up or make a cell that spans all four columns in the first row for that caption so let's go ahead and do that so to do that I'm going to start off a table row and I'm going to end off a table row so we're going to get rid of that caption tag okay then the next thing I'm going to do is create a table cell over here so we're going to do that by just making one called table data and we're just going to close that off but we now want to make this cell actually spot span over multiple columns because if i refresh this right now you can see we've got this table data or this table cell over here span over only one column and that is kind of annoying because now you've got these other three columns over here that actually have nothing above them and this first column called rank is stretched way out much further than it needs to be because you know we only have a one num one digit number in here so it really doesn't need to be as wide as it is right now so I'm going to go ahead and add an attribute over here called colspan and I'm going to set that equal to how many columns we want this cell to span over so you can see that the rest of our rows all consist of four cells so that means that we want this column to span over four cells so that it'll take up the full width of the table so let's go back and click refresh and as you can see we now have this new cell up here that actually spans over all of the other columns so we've got one one actual cell that spans over multiple columns and that is what colspan is used for and we can do the same thing except make it span over multiple rows and that is called row span so to do that I'm going to go back over to CSS or HTML I don't know why I keep calling it CSS and what I'm actually going to do here is take this cell and I'm going to cut that out I'm going to get rid of this row because we don't actually need a blank row and what I'm going to do is add that table data or that table cell into our first row okay and if I go back to Firefox now and click refresh things are going to look a little bit funny because we now have this one cell over here and to be honest it let's change that call span as well because we don't actually need that attribute there either okay because we're not going to take a look at colspan anymore we're taking a look at rowspan so click refresh we now have this column over here and then we have our actual rank is out of place because the rank the numbers 1 2 3 & 4 neither appear under this heading rank and Tetris needs to appear under the title not under the rank so everything's shifted over 1 and you know that looks kind of weird but what I want to do here is actually make this cell span over multiple rows so to do that I'm going to go back to our table over here and I'm going to go back to this this actual table data and I'm going to give that an attribute of row span and we're going to set that equal to how many rows we want this cell to span so if we take a look at this we've got 1 2 3 4 5 rows that we want that to span over so row span I'm going to set equal to 5 click refer save and come back and click refresh and as you can see we've now pushed everything back to where it's supposed to be so the rank now has the numbers 1 2 3 & 4 a title contains all the titles the release here contains the years copy sold has the copy sold but over here we've got one huge cell which contains our actual description of the table and you know this probably isn't the best way to do this but you know it's just an example so if you guys ever want to make a cell that spans over multiple rows then that is how you do that and if you want to make it span over multiple columns then I just showed you guys how to do that as well so yeah that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really gonna help my channel grow and I will see you guys in the next one
