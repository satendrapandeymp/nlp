welcome to HTML tutorials this is lesson number 28 and in this lesson I'm going to show you guys how to create a HTML entity so let's go ahead and get started the first thing that you want to do is make sure that you have the previous document open from the previous tutorial and we're gonna look for the closing order list tag and once you find that we're gonna click right after that and we're gonna create the opening and closing markup tag for a paragraph so once you create the opening and closing markup tags for the paragraph we're gonna go in between that and we're going to create our first HTML entity and the HTML entity is made up of three parts the first part is the ampersand sign so we're going to write that and then the entity name in this case we're going to write a less than sign so we'll write LT and that's the entity name and then lastly we're going to write semicolon and those are the three parts to creating the HTML entity so let's go ahead and hit ctrl s to save that and see if we see the less than sign when we preview it in our web browser and as you can see we have a less than sign here and that's how you create a HTML entity to show the less than sign now you might be thinking why would I use a HTML entity couldn't I just write the less than sign well let's go ahead and go back to our HTML document you'll notice that we've always used the less than and greater than sign for our markup tags in this case even for the paragraph tag it has the less than and greater than sign surrounding the paragraph tag in the in other words the letter P so in order to prevent the web browser from confusing the less-than and greater-than sign with the markup tag we have to use a HTML entity so hopefully that makes sense and I'll actually write it on screen if we had a less than sign like this and our our web document we would probably get it confused even when we're writing coding we might confuse the less than sign with the mark-up tag so it's important that use a HTML entity so that we can separate the two things so I'm going to go ahead and delete that another way you can write a HTML entity is by starting with the ampersand sign and then writing the pound symbol and then writing a number so in this case I'm gonna write the number 60 and then semicolon so in this case the HTML entity is written as the ampersand sign then the pound symbol and then a number and then semicolon now for the numbers the benefit of that is that most web browsers are going to be guaranteed to interpret that correctly in this case I'm writing the less than sign but I'm using a number and the pound symbol instead of the entity name and then semicolon so in the case of the one with the entity name is easier to remember but the one with the number it's almost guaranteed that every web browser is going to interpret that correctly so those are the two differences between those HTML entities so let's go ahead and hit control s and preview this in our web browser and you'll see that we have the less than sign written twice on our HTML document but again the main difference is that with one is easier to remember because we're using an entity name the other is better because well it's more guarantee that each web browser is going to interpret it correctly but in my opinion in most cases you should be safe with the entity name and if for some reason it doesn't display correctly in a web browser then just search for the entity number in order to display it that way so that's my recommendation for that so let's go back to our HTML document and I'm gonna hit the spacebar key and this time I'm gonna write another HTML entity that we might not be able to show using our keyboard so let's go ahead and try that write the ampersand sign and then we're going to write the word our eg which stands for the registration mark and that's our entity name and then we're going to write semicolon okay and let's go ahead and hit ctrl s and then preview this in our web browser and as you can see we have the registration symbol written in our HTML web page so that's something that you might not be able to display using your keyboard but if you use the HTML entity you'll be able to display that information so let's go ahead and go back to our HTML document we're going to write another HTML entity so we're going to write am person and then we're going to write copy and this is for the copyright symbol and then semicolon and then hit ctrl s and then we're going to preview this in our web browser so as you can see we now have the registration mark and the copyright symbol using HTML entities so I hope that this video was helpful and showing you how to use HTML entities and if it was don't forget to embed comment share and subscribe and stay tuned for future videos
