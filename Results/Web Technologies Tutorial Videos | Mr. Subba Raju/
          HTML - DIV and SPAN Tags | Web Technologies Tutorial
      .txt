hi guys welcome to Nareesha technologies this is a barrage another video session on HTML attacks in this video session a few real-time tax we can observe abbreviation abbr which is replaced on acronym tag originally we are calling acronym latter the replaced with a BB our tag after that wendy next span and these are the tax in advance a level available we can see in this video session a BB our tag stands for abbreviations so for example on your web page whenever we are developing terms like HTML hypertext markup language for example you can say in our mail systems generally we are using a.s.a.p as soon as possible for example who whole ell organization cascading style sheets which are stands by QA Quality Assurance like this whenever we are speaking a few terms that means of like www World Wide Web so these are the terms having stands for full form is nothing but we are calling acronym so acronym popularly known as abbreviation so previously acronym name is very popular an acronym defines an acronym an acronym must spell out another word for example I wrote some kind of terminologies NASA as soon as possible and graphical user interface like that now it is a paid tech commonly we are using how to write the speed tag practically we can observe right we'll take acronym just we can put on that acronym tag I am saying acronym tag with attributes acronym tag so acronym tag that sir I'm not giving any attribute also because local attributes are not there right acronym inside I am going to write so what exactly for example there is a attribute available title I want to write hypertext markup language so whenever I am saying that HTML right yes you can now once if you are saying that again same acronym I'm putting here copy it and paste multiple level so for example another one I am saying cascading cascading style sheets you can provide space also no restrictions cascading style sheets and another one I am providing is world wide web www.lynneshyundai.com the capital letter B like this and there is another one also available that is SAS and synthetically synthetically awesome style sheets awesome style state style sheets this is only very popular CSS advanced language yes a SS right all these will try to run on the web browser now just mouse cursor you can over excellent hypertext markup language CSS cascading style sheets ww world wide web b bootstrap says syntactically awesome style sheets what is the reason behind this why they duplicated actual acronym acronym is good one but not all devices compatibility because of this reason in the r8 latest environment this acronym replaced by a BB or abbreviation so just wherever acronym available replace with abb are with simple one right acronym just abbr replace all with a single shot everything replaced this is a latest one yes almost all it is also same there is no difference but it is all browser compatible as well as all device compatible so acronym is the old name and abbreviation is the latest name which is providing full font to the particular initial characters any kind of initial characters we can able to write after that we can observe division tag what is the div tag so DV is nothing but a division it is dividing a webpage into multiple divisions for example if you are taking a div tag symbolic and I can I can divide my webpage horizontally as well as vertically and some other things like for example first div tag information I will show you so I am implementing their HTML styles also so du stands for division block that can hold the content of others that means of it is a container so we can write other tags also inside division means a div tag so DV is very popular as a paid tag and it can hold multiple elements and if you if you want to design a web page with a specific format we can go for the div div is a paid tag and same different different attributes available depending close align is an attribute sale is an attribute ID is an attribute class is an attribute title is an attribute so different different attributes are available we'll try to observe one by one div tag yes div tag with I am providing some attributes also right to do tag and I am dividing a page into divisions for example div simply and once do you finished and I'm not writing anything symbol I said do close that's all and the same day I am duplicating one by one I want to divide a webpage into multiple divisions right I implemented only just three tags right I am writing it inside d1 maybe it won't satisfy to you but even though it is perfect example for the division to understand just non non attributes nothing available just is a div it is a three divisions available but if you are seeing like this it's completely okay it is is normal text no sir but it is not going to be like div yes exactly correct but we need to apply some more things here so at least div insert some other attacks we can try to keep for example I am keeping a bold attack it is in bold format yes simply be open be close that I am giving for example another one I and I made very clearly I it is in italics format or oblique you format it say that oblique you also and BR tag okay you can use forward slash better for you right so I said here the same kind of operation I want to implement wherever the do available I want to replace that yes perfect and I want to replace this one also right right replace let me run little bit more clarity regarding this so d1 d2 d3 so now these two areas we can apply align attribute for example I am providing a line is equal to by default left and we can say a line is equal to Center perfect and align equal to for example right side excellent right come to webpage of it they one do to do three so compared to example1 example2 giving some more clarity so will apply some more other attributes like Idid is mainly for the java c purpose of course we are using so will apply your style attributes also if you are coming with the style is we can apply style is equal to background color for example I am giving hash ff99 0 0 color course already explained I need width 100 percent total page I need height only hundred pixels okay right and I am closing that simple I made and I am not doing anything text inside this is a do and the same style I want to applicable for the next one is this one Center so once you are providing here I am giving for example F F and F F all ffs comes under white color all that I explained it and again I am removing this one also I don't want any tag inside and this one also you want to remove and I want to add here for example zero zero yes I made zero zero right once you are putting all the colors together if you are making maybe this example will give you more clarity exactly exactly yes this is giving a clarity so perfect a division they one do to do three so it is colors replace is looking like it's not Indian flag it is looking like that and you want to see that I want to add an image and whenever you are going there div inside we can keep another attack source equal to and a chakra means I have a such a shock chakra dot gif right and width is equal to and same 100 pixels online preparing yeah how nicely it is going to be we can yes in this location that name is not there yes perfect yes yes so my country flag perfectly displayed here so it is looking nice using do tag within fraction of seconds I try to shown that so almost all it is doing my outstanding job and we we can do the same thing and various various browser level we can try to execute that and I will try to show you on Chrome web browser and completely the information perfectly displaying or not we can just refresh yes and I made like this easily and effectively my flag using div tag not only this div horizontal lines we can make even vertical lines also for example this is a div I want to make vertical lines right I come back Here I am removing this image very good I want to remove this this completely yes if it is available a low right great and zero zero I'm providing so with them giving only hundred pixels not complete page right I am providing 400 pixels then I am making one good property float:left I am NOT putting this let me explain to you people yes vertical so previously horizontal I shown to you no vertical available you want to increase that weight yes definitely you can do it yes and the same thing for example I want to see that and I want to use float:right for this right nice so what tically available and it immediately you want to do some image some kind of examples you want to provide definitely you can provide so like this this a horizontal one vertical one vertical one you want to display any kind of content we can in real time industry if you are observing webpages advertisements are coming generally so advertisement purpose we are leaving some space there and here also and in middle we are writing some content so this is a best example using deep we can do perfectly all these things so now we can some more and here here's some more division-level available so I want to display in middle some image and this is that is left this is right and another one I want to keep left just and I want to change the color whatever color available here I don't want keep that so remove this and once again this one width height float so it is giving left only so for example if I if I retry to replace that so another 300 pixels I am giving yes is almost all and it is is only trouble in the response websites this trouble is not available we can apply here also another 20 I am giving it push it to next line see observe and 40 I am giving yes we need to adjust there is no other way here just one by one we need to carefully because it disturbs and another one point I am giving yes and the two three points I am supplying yeah almost so now it is looking vertical horizontal one vertical one vertical one vertical one I want to display as something as something is something so finally do tag is doing it divided a page into multiple divisions in effectively inefficient manner but nowadays in html5 do tag importance drastically reduced because in html5 there are the semantics centered one semantics entered it is using more effectively the displaying of the document structure then we can see finally span back what exactly the meaning of span where we are using span is a HTML tag which is used for the inline styles it is working very effectively to apply the inline styles but when you are observing span tag with the help of style it is more effective and simple and more convenient so we will try to observe the span tag how effectively it is working so span tag with attributes let me explain one by one right span so normal example I am showing first initially right span open span close right that is available so spare inside I want to put some information hello welcome to NIT nowadays technologies right I required the span let me and break tag also I am using because to come to next line just if I replace just if I am going to refresh just refresh yes but there is nothing to color or anything effects are not there as I explained to you in line Styles you want to apply here compulsory so span inside we need to provide style is equal to simple you can provide color and I am giving direct color orange and style equal to I am giving rain color brain as is perfect right and refresh that as nicely just looking so you want to you want to make it perfectly more perfectly means and I want to apply here background color BG color is equal to light blue then on the light blue I want to apply here style is equal to color white I am giving no issue right the more effective showing the reflection of the colors and it is in orange color white color and green color so like this kind of in line styles effectively we can apply using span tag span exclusively for the inline styles and inline style for example in line means what it is not possible cascading means one style you applied at one level means without writing those styles we can unable to apply to another line that is called cascading not possible so it is a completely strictly inline Styles we can say if you come to more clarity related to this and for example span level I am applying font to family effective one we can see how it is going to be effective Tahoma for example different different kind of families you want to observe definitely we can see those just semicolon we can apply some more things for example I am going to notepad I want to add this Arial Unicode MS definitely we can add and replace that now again for example you want the Houma right here you want to put there right we can observe that and again I am taking some more empty and I want to put here and save it refresh that ineffectively we can see so that is different this is different this is completely different like this more in line styles we can able to apply with the help of span tag and again when we are coming end of the HTML tags maximum tags I discussed in the next video session completely we can observe what are the tags are duplicated either duplicated then we'll go to more advanced level thank you for watching my videos catch me for more videos youtube.com slash nourish 80 channel
