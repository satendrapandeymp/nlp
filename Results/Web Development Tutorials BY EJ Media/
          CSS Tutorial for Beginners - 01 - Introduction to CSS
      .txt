welcome to your very first beginning tutorial on CSS and this is part of our ongoing web development series now if you do not have a solid understanding of HTML you should go to my channel page and go through the HTML for beginners tutorial set that's kind of a prerequisite now if you already know HTML and you feel you don't need that that's fine but if you don't know anything about HTML I strongly recommend that you go ahead and take that series because an understanding of HTML is really crucial to using CSS now as a note we will also be introducing some new HTML elements in this series and the reason is they go hand-in-hand together so it didn't make sense to discuss those in the HTML for beginners because they really work hand in hand with CSS in terms of what you will need we're just gonna use notepad for now just like we did in the HTML for beginners series now eventually we'll use an editor but for now we just need no pen okay so what is CSS well here's the dictionary version CSS stands for cascading style sheets it is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language markup language which is coarse for us HTML well that's pretty nice that dictionary term but what is it simply well it just adds style to your HTML that's it pretty simple and the nice thing about it is you can completely control how your webpages look without changing your HTML and so it comes in very handy an analogy I like to use is imagine you build a fence and imagine that fence is your HTML but the fence is unpainted is basically just wood and so in order to add color to it you need to paint that fence so the paint would be the CSS in this analogy it adds style to the fence so that's a good way to think of it you could also use the same analogy for our house you build the house and then you have to add style to the house right you have to paint the inside in the exterior you know you need to add fixtures and paintings and all sorts of things that add style to the house so that's a good way to think of this okay well let's not waste any more time let's go ahead and do some CSS in this initial video ok so let's open up nope and we're going to reuse some of the source that we used in the HTML tutorial series and you guys will probably recognize that if you took that series I think this is from episode 2 or 3 now if you do not have this source feel free to hit the pause button now and just go ahead and copy all of this so let's go ahead and add some CSS to this HTML document and what we're gonna go ahead and use here is the style element tag and it's just style that's simple and you'll notice that we're putting this within the head element that's where this goes because remember it's not actually content we're actually just styling some of the elements in the body remember we're gonna go ahead and paint some of these we're gonna give this some color actually so let's go ahead and add a closing tag for this and there you go now I want to point out two things this style element is an HTML element we put our CSS inside here but this is actually an HTML element so all of our CSS that we're gonna code will go inside this element everything inside here I also want to point out that this is one way that we can reference our CSS there are other ways we can go ahead and reference our CSS this is just one way now we will be covering that in future tutorials but for now this is one way and just keep that in mind that there are other ways and I will go over that in another tutorial okay so now let's go ahead and save this document if you haven't already and you want to save this as a HTML document and it's probably gonna say I already have it there already exists and I'm gonna go ahead and hit yes to this now what we want to do here is let's just take a look at the page - any CSS so we haven't added any CSS yet we just added the HTML element but let's go ahead and just minimize this and we will open this up and there you can see we have no color yet added this so let's close that out and we'll go back to the source okay so now we're back in the source and let's go ahead and select the element that we want a style and in this case I want to select the h1 element so we're gonna go up here and type in h1 now this is the selector and what we're doing is telling CSS this is the element that we want to style so all we have to do is type in h1 notice we don't have to use the angle brackets we only have type in h1 so just keep that in mind now we also need an opening and closing squiggly bracket and all the styles that we're gonna do will go within these two brackets so everything that we style in this h1 element will be between these two brackets and actually let's create some space here so that we have so it's a little easier to read this now we have to decide the style that we want to apply to here and in this case we're gonna go ahead and change the background color of this now we could underline this we could change the font there's all kinds of things we could do but in this case we're just gonna do one style today now we'll cover all the different ways you can style HTML elements but in this case we're gonna do background color and each one of these styles is called a property that's what they're actually called and the property we use is background - color now again that is the property now after the property we put in a colon but we're not done now we have to specify what value that color is gonna be or simply what color we want this to be and in this case we want this to be purple and so that is the value and then we put in a semicolon and this is the way it's going to be for all the CSS that you do from this point on this is the same type of thing you'll be doing so you get really used to this you'll put the property you'll put a colon then you have to specify the value that you want in this case we need a color which is purple and then you put a semicolon now if we did another CSS property we would just put this right below and we would do the same type of procedure and actually what this semicolon does is it's a break it says okay I'm done with this move on to the next property now collectively all this is called a CSS rule but the way I like to think of it is we're just saying hey I want to style this h1 element and I want the background to be purple and as I said if we want to add any other styles we would just put them right below here and again we'll be doing that in future tutorials so let's go ahead and save this now and let's go ahead and open up the document and there you can see we've got a purple background now for our head one element okay so that's gonna do it for this tutorial I will see you guys in the second tutorial
