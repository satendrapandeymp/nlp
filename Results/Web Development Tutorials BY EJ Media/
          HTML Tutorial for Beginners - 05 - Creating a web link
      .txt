welcome to the fifth tutorial on beginning HTML today we are gonna look at adding links to your web page now what would your web page be without links well it wouldn't be much navigation is a key consideration in to designing your website and so we will begin with adding links to your web page now there are two ways to add links first is to link to an outside web page and second is to link to a section within your web page in this video we are going to cover linking to an outside URL now links are added with the anchor element and within the anchor element is an attribute called href and that tells the anchor element where the destination is for the link and the destination can be like I said it can be a web page on the same site or it can link to an outside website and as I said we will link to an outside URL in this video ok so let's first create ap element or if you remember this stands for paragraph because we need to add some text and sentences inside and around our link so will embed everything within that and now we will add our anchor tag now within the opening a tag and opening P tag we are gonna create some text and we are gonna say please click on this link and this will just come out as straight text and it will come out before our link which is embedded in here and now we're gonna create the href attribute we're gonna hit equals and then you're gonna put in quotes and here is where we are going to put in our outside URL that we want to link to in our web page and in this case I am just going to link to my YouTube channel page so we'll go ahead and just copy and paste that in here and we have to create a end quote now we can add some text before we make the closing anchor tag and that text will become the link so this does not actually get displayed what will be displayed as a link is the text that we put in here so we will say EJ media channel page and actually I think I made a mistake here we need to actually keep this tag open so this actually has to stay open we do not use a angle bracket here because this is all part of the link so again if you put that angle bracket in get rid of it and now this should work let's go ahead and save this and let's actually do something different here let's actually open this up within google chrome and you can see we've got our link now and if I click on that it should go to my YouTube channel page and it did now if we pull up the source here you can see that there is the text again where we said please click on this link that is not actually part of the link because it comes before the a element the anchor element and there you can see the text that we created for our link and that is part of the link because we put that between the closing angle bracket and the closing anchor tag so that becomes part of the link and obviously that's a little bit easier to read than the actual URL and obviously you guys have seen that many times when you've been out on the web okay that's gonna do it for this video in the next video we will look at links again and we will look at linking within an existing web page
