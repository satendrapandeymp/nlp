all ready let's get started um for code editing of chosen one that's called Komodo edit and it's free and you're free to use this one or to use any other code editing tool that you feel not the most comfortable with my advice is to pick one try a couple of them pick one that you like and just stick with it in my courses I I used different code editors because sometimes I'm in the mood for one or another and also I just want to show you how flexible this can be I don't want you to really get married with one particular code editor so early in your in your learning path so let's get started I have an almost empty HTML document here which contains the head the body and all of the corresponding tags and I'll show you two manners of adding JavaScript code first thing I want to say JavaScript code just like HTML code it's basically text so it's code it's text that we're going to write whether in whether it's in this file or and in an external file that external file is also going to be text a text file but the extension of the external files when working with JavaScript is jas okay first manner of including JavaScript code is by using the script tag the code editor I'm using has auto-completion so it's automatically closed the script tag inside of the script tag is where I entered my JavaScript code we haven't really learned any JavaScript coding yet so I'm just gonna write alert which allows you to show a pop-up a pop-up window that's going to say hello and I'll save this when you open a website it always gets loaded from top to bottom so these things get processed first and then when we reach the JavaScript code all of the statements all of the lines of code that will write are processed from top in a top-down manner so I'm in my web browser here I have this page loaded but I need to reload it now that we've modified things and I can do that by using this button the reload page button or by pressing f5 in the keyboard so I'm going to press f5 and you'll see that now the JavaScript code gets executed and I get an alert box that says hello that's one way of including JavaScript code another equivalent way is to also use the script tag but in this script tag we're going to specify an external file source attribute the file that I'll include is going to be in the same folder as index.html it's going to be called script MJS it's important here to close this tag and to close it in this way not too if you just close like that it's not going to work it needs to be closed like this now where to place where to place the script tags when you were including files it's recommended to do it at the very bottom right before the closing of the body the reason being that the page gets loaded top down as I mentioned and if you're including external files it's going to look for those files before rendering the rest of the page so you always want the page to be rendered for the final user as fast as it can be and then behind the scenes it keeps on loading other JavaScript files there are cases when you're using javascript in your body where you need the file that that declares that JavaScript loaded beforehand but most cases you're okay with putting this at the end and it's recommended best best practice it's a different case with style tags with CSS those need to always be loaded at the beginning because once the page is rendered in the browser it doesn't get modified by the CSS changes so you want to have the CSS first and then you render the page now let's create this script the J's file because we have that pending still so I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to type in the same code as I typed before which is going to be hello and semicolon at the end and I'm going to save this in the folder where the other one with the other file is script is and now if I reload the page you'll see that it's loading that external file and it's saying hello so just to summarize two ways of including JavaScript they both involve using the script tags you can put it in an external file or you can do it directly in your code if you're including external files it's always recommended to put them at the end of your body except for particular cases but 90% of the time you you're good with putting them at the end for better performance
