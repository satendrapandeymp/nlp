all right friends welcome back this is the third topic and in this third topic I'm actually going to start writing code for the images chapter and I have this basic HTML skeleton ready here in front of me and as I told you I had okay let me try to delete this okay yes yes and I told you that I have organized folders for this course and each folder belongs to a specific chapter and right now I'm in the image chapter you can do the same you know create an HTML one folder and for each chapter create a folder so right now I'm in the image chapter and I have some sample images that I want to play with okay the first image that I'm gonna have is this JPEG image okay let's try to let's keep this here so that I can see the file it's a JPEG image okay let's write the source image I'm going to write the source I'm gonna run the program image source is equal to okay let's write the local it's a local file right it's located within the same file within the same location as this main file so the local file is going to get an absolute address which means no pathway needed just direct then directly type the name of the image JPA eg in H dot jpg okay and both commas closed and I'm going to close the time clothes that I have knocked this slash but add of course I forgot to ride the alt text always why the alt text okay and then say blonde Elsie plant a plant okay and I'm gonna close this symbol commas and close a time okay let me save the file file save as okay and let's just do this one time and let's run this file there you go okay let me remove the previous examples here okay this is it okay supposing I need a smaller file sorry different dimensions of this file all I need to do is add height and width okay I will change something the height you can define the width remember you should be using style but the style attribute only works well when you using CSS coding okay we can do that in HTML too right now just let's why work with basic HTML coding okay okay let's let's just go for that SJ bit is equal to 100 okay you can play with size and see which size you like and height is equal to again 100 okay and yes I think this in tax is correct we shouldn't have any problems all right then let's just save and refresh this page there you go it became smaller and what if I want to make it bigger notice that you wouldn't lose your quality of the picture okay let's make this 500 pixels file safe all right so this looks bigger and better but if you try to stretch the same image using the gif or the PNG file this image would lose its clarity okay it's a bit distorted because the dimensions are not the ratio of the dimensions are not well decided and determined okay so let's change this to something wider and the height should be small okay 200 I'll say and then there you go this looks much better okay I'm going to keep this so that you can compare let's try to write code for a PNG and a gif image okay and instead of writing the whole code again let me just copy ctrl C okay and I want to add a break because then the images could be one on top of the other be our break k2 line breaks and then ctrl V and this is local file so nobody's just type the file name directly horse PNG dog panting okay okay a beautiful horse grazing grass okay for somebody who is visually impaired they should be able to visualize this and the height is going to be the same as the above okay let me take this away yes looks clean let me save and run the file again there you go same size okay and this is a PNG image okay but notice that the colors are not very realistic as the photograph okay this still looks like as if someone's painted it why because you have limited colors okay and the PNG has limited colors as compared to the 17 million color combinations available for your photographs okay and last but not the least I want to try this file here the gif file okay and again I am going to copy and paste let me add a line break a line break notice I'm keeping the same height and width of all the images just so that you know it's not too heavy on the eyes and you can play with the sizes in any way you want Annie made it gee I am dot gif right and the thing is this is a rectangular file so let's see it should be longer I'm gonna make every change the heightened bit like this can make this 300 probably hide should be a little bit yeah file save and let's refresh this page there you go okay now this is too long let me make the image short hang there you'll be able to see it in a bit okay let's make this just 100 width and height is equal to 220 this is how I play you know with files image files there you go okay this is still too narrow but the point is that this is animated and you can see the digital claw you know the numbers come from one to seven okay nine and yes six okay these are the different colors okay different alphabets I don't know what it's showing malfunctioning the thing is it's animated and you can use that on your website in many many examples are many many images available for you to use animated images okay all right supposing okay I want to connect this horse image or the plant image let's take this plant image and I want to connect this with the superior world how would you do that how would you do that how can you connect an image to a website okay and that's coming up next in the next video hang there see you soon
