we're gonna continue right where we left off in the last video and of course we created this nice thumbnail code but I forgot to add an anchor tag so let's go ahead and do that and you kind of need that for a thumbnail so let's go ahead and add that we're gonna add that right here so of course we're just gonna specify an anchor tag here and of course we're gonna use an href and then we're just gonna point to our file which of course is our CH jpg and since it's in the same folder we don't need to specify a directory here okay that's good so now we should get our link so let's go ahead and save this and let's load this up in Chrome and we'll see what we get and there we go take a look at that now we've got our hand and if we click on this it creates a larger image which is what a thumbnail is all about so let's go ahead and close this now that we have our code set we can go ahead and create our image gallery and you will remember when we talked about the bootstrap grid you of course first have your container then your row and then your columns but of course since we already have our row and container specified all we need is this column right here all the code right here so we're gonna go ahead and copy and paste this code right here only to create our second column with our image and this is why once you get your code set like I said it's really easy to create an image gallery in bootstrap so let's go ahead and copy this and we're gonna come right down here at this div and hit space a few times and we're gonna go up one here and then go ahead and copy and paste our new column in and of course these two divs right here close out our container and roll but we do not want to copy those over and over again again we just want our column code with our thumbnail that's all we need so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get take a look at that that looks great but these are a little bit too large when you say usually when you have an image gallery with thumbnails they're much smaller so let's go ahead and lower the size of these a little bit so let's make this a two and let's make this a three and then let's go ahead and make this a two and let's make this a three good let's go ahead and save this and we'll reload this and there you can see that looks a lot better these look actually like thumbnails and let's make sure the second one works does good okay so let's go ahead and add a bunch of more columns and like I said it gets very easy in bootstrap once you have your code in place so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this over several times all right and let's go ahead and reload this and see what we get and take a look at that we've got a fully functioning image gallery and bootstrap is doing almost all the work for us okay we will continue on with the image gallery in the next video thank you
