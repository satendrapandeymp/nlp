welcome to the 26th tutorial on beginning CSS in this video we're going to talk about the div HTML element and we've kind of been using that but we're going to expand upon it in this video now the div is an HTML element as I said but the reason I did not introduce it in my beginning HTML series is that it is pretty much used hand-in-hand with CSS so it makes sense to talk about it in the CSS series now the div element is used to divide your webpage into logical sections and so this deals with the web page layout and what do I mean by that well let's say you have a menu that could be a section you might have a group of related images that could be a logical section you might even have part of a blog with text that could be a logical section it's really a way of dividing up your web page into areas that perform a particular function so let's open up our website but before we do that actually let's take a look at the HTML code here for a second let's do a little bit of housecleaning let's move the class and put it into our IMG element and we'll just remove that and this should make no difference okay instead of using it in the div tag we're putting it in the image element itself and then let's go ahead and save this and then let's let's go back into our style sheet and we're going to go down here and we're going to type in IMG dot and then we're going to put in here text - aligned - Center semicolon now I will explain why I'm doing this in a few videos but for now don't worry about any of this I will explain this in a few videos so let's go ahead and save this let's open up our web page in Google Chrome and everything looks good as it has been now we want to divide up our web page into two logical sections that's what we've got here we've got one section that kind of is our main section right it has our first heading to say that this is our fish website and then we have this sentence here to kind of say what it's a out and then we have our opening picture now we can identify this is a new section that deals with bass fish so we have two sections and so we want to create a div element for all this and a div element for all of this so let's close this out and let's close out our style sheet and then let's go into our HTML code and we can just go ahead and copy and paste some div tags here so we'll put a div tag right here and we'll put a closing div tag right here now this now this becomes a nested div tags and you can nest div tags within do tags so there's actually sections within sections but don't worry about that right now let's just concentrate on the main section that we're going to be doing here and then let's let's actually put a space here and let's go ahead and put a div tag around our other section which is on bass fish and we'll close it out down here and there we go and if we save this and reopen our website you'll see that nothing's really changed and that's the first point I want to make about a div tag they don't really do anything by themselves they just identify a particular section like I said so they're kind of transparent if you want to think of it like that so now what we want to do is give this a ID attribute because these are going to be unique so we'll do a little copy and paste this we can just take this ID we'll come up here and let's give this an ID of main and we'll college actually div main and then we'll take this same one and we'll go down to our bass section and we'll call this div bass and let's save this and then let's let's go back into our stylesheet and let's create some rules now we'll just take these rules and let's go ahead and and what we're going to do is we'll say pound div mein and all we're going to do is set the text in here and then that's all we're going to do is black and then we'll create a div tag for our bass section and we're going to do the same thing we're going to keep the color of the text black let's save this now and then let's go ahead and open up our web page and you'll see we've got black text but you'll notice now that our headers are in black and that is because they are inheriting the color black we are actually if you take a look at this that we didn't have anything in our headers we didn't set a font color and so it's going to inherit that from our disk because that's what we said it we set it right here the reason the first paragraph didn't we open this back up this first paragraph still isn't blue and the reason is because we specified blue so this was an override we talked about that in earlier videos we override it what we had in our div class so that stays the same now of course we're actually overriding the color green right that's what was setting those headers to green because we put that property in the body element so these h1 and h2 headers were inheriting that now if we want that back that's pretty simple we'll just specify the color green and our two headers let's save this let's open it up and now the headers are back to green but our text remains in black and this is what I did can actually be useful they not only organize the sections of your website you can also use them for inheritance kind of the way we are using the body element so now you know we don't have to put black in these paragraphs we can actually take these out and they will inherit it so if we remove these the font color should still remain black so let's go ahead and save this well open this up and you can see it remains black because it's inheriting it from our two divs okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
