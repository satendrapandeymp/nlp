this is part 46 of JavaScript tutorial in this video we'll discuss how to open a pop-up window using javascript to open a pop-up window we use window open method notice this method has got four parameters URL name features and replace all these parameters are optional let's look at them one by one the first parameter is URL this parameter specifies the URL of the page that we want to open in the pop-up window if the URL is not specified and new window with about colon blank will be open we'll look at an example of that shortly the second parameter is name this parameter specifies the target attribute or the name of the vendor here are the possible values that this parameter can have if we set it to underscore blind the URL is loaded into a new window this is the default in case if we didn't supply a value for this parameter explicitly if we set it on a scope parent then the URL is loaded into the parent frame if we set it or underscore self then the URL replaces the current page if we set it to underscore table then the URL replaces any frame sets that may be loaded we'll discus frames and frame sets in detail in a later video session we can also give on this name and explicit a value for example my window and we can later use that name in our JavaScript program we'll look at an example of that shortly the third parameter is features so basically using this parameter you can specify you know for the pop-up window whether you want scroll bars or not whether you want that pop-up to be resizable or not but you want status bar but you want menu bar or not notice these features on the top of the table they take sno values and the features at the bottom that is height and width top and left they have to be specified in pixels now top and left features are used to position the pop-up window we'll discuss those with an example important thing to keep in mind is that you know these features have to be a comma separated list and also keep in mind not all browsers support all these features the fourth parameter is replays this parameter specifies for that the URL creates a new entry or replaces the current entry in the browser history this works only if the URL is loaded into the same vendor if it said this replace parameter to true then URL replaces the current document in the history list if we set it a false URL creates a new entry in the browser history list now let's look at a few examples of using this window dot open method so here we have a button and on click of the button we're calling open method this method has four parameters but at the moment notice that we are not passing any parameter so we are also not specifying URL so when we don't specify URL look at what's going to happen it's going to open about colon blank okay a new window with about colon blank that's the default behavior if you don't specify the value for URL parameter now let's if you want to open google.com in a new window so to window dot open we are passing the URL of the page that we want to open in a new window so let's save these changes reload the page click open pop-up notice that google.com is opened in a new tab that's the default behavior by default most modern browsers are configured to open the pop-ups in new tabs instead of separate windows now if you want the pop-up to open in a new window there is a work down specify these three parameters you are a name and then features features that is height and width okay so let's look at that in action so here we have the URL let's specify a name the default is underscore black so let's set that and now we have to specify the features height equals 100 width equals 100 let's actually set width to 400 height to 400 okay let's save these changes reload the page open pop-up now notice that the URL is opened in a new window so here we have google.com but keep in mind this workaround may not work in all browsers and it also depends on users browsers preferences for example the end users can configure their browsers to open pop-up windows in new tabs instead of new windows and if they have configured their browser so we cannot override that using javascript now when name parameter is set to underscore cells then the new window replaces the current window so basically now look at what's happening when we click open pop-up google.com is opened in a new vendor now let's set you know this the second parameter is the name parameter in this instead of underscore blind let's actually set it to underscore self we don't require heightened with let's get rid of them save the changes reload the page so it's HTML 1 dot HTM that's the page so when we click open a pop-up look at what's going to happen google.com is opened in the same vendor ok now using the top and left features we can specify where we want the pop-up window to be plus position so let's to speed things up I already have typed that so let's copy and paste it with another visual studio instance so notice that here we have specified the URL we have given an explicit name to the vendor and then we have specified height and width for the pop-up and look at this I'm saying top equals 400 left equals 400 let's see what is this going to do and then so let's go back to HTML page one dot HTM now let's click open pop-up look at that because we have set top to 400 and left to 400 the pop-up window you know it's starting here so from top 400 pixels and from left 400 pixels so that's where the pop-up starts now if we set it to for example let's say 100 and 100 when we click this open a pop-up the pop-up is going to open up somewhere here you know 100 pixels from the top 100 pixels from the left so let's look at that in action look at that you know 100 pixels on the top hundred pixels from the left now you can also disable scroll bars and resizing and whether you want resizing or not basically notice here we are saying scroll bars equal to no resizable equal to now let's look at this in action so let's copy this paste it here so here we have the URL name of the window in the features list we are specifying height width and whether we want scroll bars are not so let's save the changes reload the page now these features that is crawl bars and resizable they don't work in google chrome so look at that it displays scroll bars and I can resize the vendor okay now let's open this page with Internet Explorer so let's browse with IE and let's click open pop-up now notice we have pop-up which is opening google.com look at that first thing we don't have scroll bars and I can't resize this so this example works in IE but not in chrome now to close pop-up we use window dot close method okay let's look at that in action so let's say I want two buttons here one is open pop-up let's get rid of all this code and let's have another button and let's say the value on this is close pop-up let's include a script tag and then let's write two functions here open pop-up and all this is going to do is window open and let's specify that URL as google.com and let's specify a name underscore blank and let's also specify height in width height equals 300 and width equals 300 and let's write another function closed pop-up now we want to close the pop-up vendor so let's create a variable let's call this my vendor so we are assigning my window you know a reference to the pop-up window that is open and on that window object we are going to call closed method and let's call this closed pop-up function when we click close pop-up button similarly let's call this open proper function when we click open pop-up button so let's save these changes reload the page so when we click open pop-up it should open google.com now when we click close pop-up it should close this pop-up automatically look at that the pop-up is closed so to close a pop-up window use a window door close method not only pop-up you can close any window using this close method thank you for listening and have a great day
