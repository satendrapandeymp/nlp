now in this video of HTML we will discuss about the phrase tags suppose you are working on a big test or a particular HTML document and out of that you want to emphasize some particular part like you want to highlight a particular part differently so in that particular case you can go for the phrase tags which are as here like emphasize this e/m tag we that we will use will make the italic text out of the big text mark text will change the background to yellow strong will make it bolder when you say address it will basically come in a new line and then it will be tallix abbreviation if you want to show a particular text on a means a small form of any particular bigger text like TP for tutorials coin that is the abbreviation and quotation tag which will actually put the text in the double quotes so let's see how these tags will affect the output of a HTML document so let's start the practical implementation now now in context of the phrase tags I'll start working with the e/m tag that is emphasized tag so in whichever text you will put this eeehm tag that will be italics alright that will look like angelic text so basically now in the complete paragraph i am emphasizing on these particular words so whenever you want to make something like emphasized you can use the e/m tag for that similarly you can use the tag mark in order to highlight some of the important text out of a paragraph so as here you can see background of the particular color that means the background of this particular text marked will be yellow alright so if you want to make some changes or if you want to highlight a particular text out of a big paragraph you can use the mark tag and can enclose the important text between that if you want to make the changes in the color like it this one is highlighted from yellow so you can later start working on CSS which will help you out in highlighting the background of any text with the color you want now next stack in the freest at least is this strong tag so whenever you will put this strong the text and close within it will be look bolder than others alright so like this one is the strong tack all right so this will help you out in highlighting in the another manner like first of all I was changing the background color of any particular test now I am using strong to make it bolder similarly all the three tags which we have used so far like emphasized mark and strong all are actually highlighting the particular takes out of a paragraph in the different manners similarly we do have a tag here in the list called the abbr tag that is the abbreviated tag alright so basically whenever you want to use some abbreviations you can use the a via tag where you will put the full form of the particular abbreviated tag text for example I want to say welcome to tutor this point but here rather than using tutorials point I've used TP so using this abbreviation tag I will tell that T P stands for tutorials point so let's come to the browser and see how this every vision tag is looking like so here you can see there's some dotted underline between beneath the TP when I will put the mouse over it you can see the full form of TP that is tutorials point now the last tag in the list which we have is the address tag basically this address tag is used to enclose an address between itself so whatever text you will use between the address will be looking like this means automatically the line is broken all right it is coming down and in the italic form so it is not just showing the text in the italics but it is also breaking the line as you can see now for that I am not using the BR track anywhere but as soon as this address track is started it is coming completely in a new line so this is how you can use these phrase in order to decorate your HTML page
