hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series from the past few video tutorials we are understanding designing layout of a web page by comparing layout design by using table tag find layout design by using give them in the previous video tutorial we have created this web page layout by using table and by using give Dan and we have compared one with another how to create this layout by using table and how to create the same layout by using game in this video tutorial our from this video tutorial on world for the next few video tutorials we are going to design this web page lynnium we understand how do we design this web page layout by using table as well as how do we design the same web page layout by using div tag we compare one with another and we understand stebmaster first thing is we are going to create a container that is going to hold our complete web page layout so let's get started and minimize it I go to start type here good pad I click on notepad then I write typical HTML structure opening HTML tag closing HTML tag opening head tag losing head tag opening body tag and closing body tag in the head section I am going to create title within title set to layout design by using table closing item file save as save the file at the stop with the name layout using table dot HTML good sites I put double quotations and click on save button and minimize this you can see layout using table dot HTML page bar created I right-click on it open with the Firefox you can see that layout using table dot HTML page got open and title ii said to layout design by using table i minimize it and open the notepad i'm gonna change this table to give and save the file as file save as file name i am going to give is layout using div dot HTML both sites i put double quotation and stave the pilot desktop you can see that one more why God created with the name layout using div dot HTML page and I'll click on it open with quit Firefox didn't see that layout using give dot HTML page mark open and title is said to layout design by using it now we have two files created let me open the notepad and close it directly on layout using table dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize it I right click on layout using cave dot HTML page open with the notepad minimizing first as I told they are going to create a container so first I am going to create a container in layout design by using table dot HTML pH Here I am going to create a table opening table closing table it is going to have one TR and one be closing TD and the content I am going to write here is main container given this table is going to become a container or wrapper for our complete web page layout so I am going to give ID here as rapin you can give here wrapper or main container whatever you like in this place I prefer wrapper because most of the professionals will use the ID as wrapper then I am going to set its properties good it is going to have 900 pixels and it is going to have order of 1 pixel file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the table god created with 1 TD and you can see there is a space between outer border and inner border outer border is one pixel thickness and inner border has one pixel thickness total two pixels thickness it is going to become when we merge them so first thing I am going to remove cell spacing I say here cell spacing equal to 0 pixel file stay put browser refresh now this border is actually off to pixel width okay we remove the cell spacing as well as I remove cell padding see II ll be a double d ind cell packing i said to 0 pixels then i am going to align this table to the center of browser file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that now the table is aligned to the center of the browser same operation we can do in layout design by using div once I go to layout using div dot HTML page Here I am going to create a div with an ID of wrapper and it is going to have a style snake style is going to be grid of 900 pixels first thing semicolon then it is going to have a border of 2 pixel solid gray color semicolon and then here I am going to write the content as main container div this div is going to become a main container for our web page layout or it is a wrapper for our mundo file save good browser and refresh you can see that the Dave got created but it is not center-aligned what I need to do is I have to use the margin property ma r GI n margin i set auto semicolon then what happens automatically this div is aligned to the center of the nose where file save good browser and refresh you can see that this is aligned to the center if you compare both of them they are looking quite similar you can see that now we have created a wrapper this wrapper we are going to use and inside this wrapper only we are going to put our complete web page Liam hope you guys have understood how do we design on how to be creative wrapper or a main container by using table and div now we proceed further and create the header to do that we are going to go to the layout using table dot HTML page inside this TD I am going to create one more table through here I say table and closing table this table is going to have only one TR and 1 TD closing TD and here I say H EA D our header content area this table is going to have width of 100% 100% means total width of this parent then it is going to have height hei GSD height height we are going to set two 100 pixels it is also going to have BG color set to orange it is not going to have cell spacing cell SP AC ing cell spacing to zero pixels then cell padding I said to zero pixels and the idea I am going to give it is header hea de our header to uniquely identify it you can see here i am aligning the attribute once i create this table let's see how it looks file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the header got created and rapper also increased you can see the border around let me put this content top aligned so I go to this TD and here I say V a Li Jian align to top file save go to browser and refresh you can see that header got aligned now same thing I can do in layout design by using div also I go to layout using div dot HTML page I am going to remove this main container div inside this I am going to create another div and this div is going to be having an ID of header and it is going to have a style set to width WI DT head width of 100% semi colon it is going to have height of 100 pixels semi colon it is going to have background - color set to orange semi colon double quotation let's see how it looks now file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the header got created content we don't have let me put the content also here at EA de our header content area file save go to browser and refresh if you compare both of them they are same and you can observe here we are just converting the table to divs that is how it looks now file save I hope you guys have understood how do we add the header for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we are going to proceed further and create the next part of the layout for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube
