hello guys what's up its Tyrone here and we're gonna continue with our HTML tutorial series and in this video I think we're going to move further but before that I was about to complete two other tags there I couldn't complete so first let's do with that so this is the text editor and this is the live server which I'm running and now first thing I want to do is this text is really small so I just wanna change the size of it so just go to style dot CSS if you have guests right there wrapped is inside a div called dot C so you could directly write the rules there and stop writing individually for each element here I said we don't have these elements but still hey dub C and in the Dipsy we're going to write font size which will change the size of the font and set it to around say 20 pixels C and yes that's good I think our little 24 pixel C good so we have that and we have another property called line height hook just let's go through it line height and let's set it to 1.5 see yep so what is line height property does it does it it will just give the height differences between every line so it's kind of like padding I'll tell you what padding is but actually it's not it's different so let's people line how I took around 2.0 say we have this okay let's just proceed with the tutorial I will talk about this more later so the other thing we missed in the last tutorial was within a P okay um just imagine if you want to h2o saving so it appears like that well if you want that to to appear just below the hedge you would probably use sub because it's a subscript right because it's a subscript same back so beautiful so h2o but blaming and like chemistry so other P tag and now if you want to use these formulas because you're too much behind channels like physics goal so we just go on typing gusto m C square actually I like the channel physics cool I've been following her since around hang on to your for years and you write su p there's a superscript this P right after it right save you can e equals MC squared so this is how you do HTML just make sure it's recording so this is how you do HTML formatting these are the different things there I think it's pretty much it now let's just save it and go to another HTML file create a new file just type HTML 4.15 save it just copy the code from here to here paste and remove this C now what we are going to walk out those HTML quotations save it go to for say a shame a quotation cool for this let's use another style file actually no more let's use the same you could actually use another style file or you could use plenty of style parts actually more show that let's type style 1 dot CSS C now in the HTML 4 let me just close this really quick HTML 4 file let's link it link area equals to stylesheet' href [Applause] equals to x 1 dot CSS C so now whatever the rules I write in style as the last time one would be applied to this file but if you remember the hierarchy we talked about in the previous tutorial the rules will be first preference I mean the first one will be given to the in line okay and the second preference would be given to the internal ones and the third preference will be given to the external files but when you talk about external files when you link them up like this okay the first preference would be given to the HTML sorry the external CSS file which comes at the right bottom okay and this would be big even though second to friends for instance if we have another here it means style 3 dot CSS then it will be given the third preference so on now what you mean by preference for example let's go to styled up CSS and everything the Tipsy you get this is two heading heading color aqua right just copy this and since we've given style one below the style you could just go to style 1 and paste it and if you change the color to say red it's not re it is already save it you just change to red irrespective of what you mentioned here okay so it works like that let's just do the add EQ [Applause] we don't need this see so we have that now what we want to do in this video we would like to continue with the hasty ml quotations so let's continue with it so within the paragraph let's say you want to use a code ok to use a code you use cue tag and you tell like well calm everybody close the cue and close be save it you would get a beautiful thing like this if you had written it properly ok you get this welcome everybody EBE okay welcome everybody so you get it this is for Q if you want a block code a whiny bit block code block code is like equal P turn again sales angle block code [Applause] see and within this block out whatever you give it'll be like indented automatically by the browser okay now we'll just copy this welcome anybody you know what that looks like wait a little bit actually really intended if I give you a long paragraph you'll get to know but it is actually in indented believe me but these are some things which we don't usually use it in our website but I just want you to know there are other tags like there are maybe a PBR headed for a privation and there's a dress okay and there is B do we change the direction of the text we give inside and we have CIT so there are so many times again like these are like very much less used in good web design pages sorry dolphins you may use it but we don't usually use it I work with a lot of web developers and we don't use these things so I just don't want to waste your time but if you are interested I have the links down in the description below you could feel free to go check them out so now let's proceed with doable other part of this tutorial next what I would like to tell you is we have seen about the anchor tags a tag right let's cut live with that a href equals to do TLD oh sorry that won't work so HTTP dues are really dot-com and go to goop hey save it so you have something beautiful like this if you want to style it here gets it right since we are going to stylish if we could try it here a and let's give it a color and say alright let's write a random color 1/2 D F awesome ok so we have the awesome color here so once we pick will without any doubt go to Google but simply have clicked it it is of the form visited to a link there are actually many many kind of activity to use I would rather tell it as situations so a of visited that is if the link is already clipped and a else active that has been links at the moment quick then if however there is when you hover the mouse over the element example like this this is Horry so you could write separate set of route for these so visited let's change the color to save you save a sea change blue in this one let's see two white political differentiated and on hovering let's change the color to say random colors let me see see no when I hover over it we change to this random color which we came okay I'll tell you how these colors up here okay don't worry have you backed up so this thing no just observe it and click what would happen hey I tell you what let's just change it to something else like this is keep background color to say hello save it now I'm gonna click it yeah it does see that's what activeness then you click it it just changes the property and once you click it it goes there and this is the visited move okay so this is how no such is it it's actually like see here the color things are messing this up but if we get the whole idea it's awesome mr. t means the link has been only quick and active means like it is being quick see sometimes it doesn't work don't worry about it then however means you have hovered over the animage okay so that is the whole lot of meaning in it just don't worry it will work then the next thing I would like to continue with is see let's get into HTML comments so what is your writing this code and you want your friends to understand or other web developers to understand you could write comments comments on something like as usual in other languages they are not sure the browser but in the text editors they're shown for example if I write here the link goes to Google save it this appears here but you don't want this top here so what do you do use comments in HTML you type comments why opening this angular bracket exclamation mark tobu - and when you want to close it use the double - again and close this angular black save it now that doesn't appear this is the comment thing which we use here you can also comment code like if I just experimenting and you don't want that for the time being you use it you are able to close it here same see all of this has disappeared so this is how you do the commenting the next let's move on to padding and margins so in orange I just do that in the next video so thank you for being with me guys see you in the next video hope you had fun and learn something don't worry we'll be recapping it in next video but one thing I would like to say is all of these things cannot be fine hearted so just don't sit there by hearting these tags just watch my video and ladies while you're working out in the text editors so that you can also like type something one telling and you can see the reason slide and you also experimented tweak with it I leave from the usual links down in the description thanks for clicking here see [Music]
