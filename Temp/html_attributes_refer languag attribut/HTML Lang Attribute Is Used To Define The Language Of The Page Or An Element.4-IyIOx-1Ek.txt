in this video I'm going to show you how to use the Lang attribute in HTML to define the language of your complete HTML page or to specific elements in the page and we're getting started right now hey guys what's up welcome back to another video it's born from higher learning lab but we help you get better at coding so you can earn more for yourself for your clients or for your business if it's your first time here make sure you click on the subscribe button and then click on the bell notification icon so you notified when we publish more awesome tutorials for you and with that out of the way let's get into the screen capture of this tutorial I'll see you there so to get started I just have a simple HTML page created up here in the code down below is how it renders in a browser and we're going to use the Lang attribute which basically just tells browsers what the default language is of a page and you always want to associate at least one Lang attribute with your HTML tag at the very top the way we do that we type where we click into that tag lee tae pleng equals and then what the default language is on that page so in my case it's English but you can also further define that as English US English Canada English Australia English UK so you can define the English specifically to which country to which or which dialect I guess of English or speaking or you can just have en for English so this will apply to all elements on the page to all inherit it automatically if we save this page or save that file refresh this page nothing changes nothing at all it's just the browser will detectives being English that's all so what we can also do like I said that that applies to or it's inherited by all other elements if we have elements on the page that are a different language we can actually apply the Lang attribute to those elements so this first paragraph is in English but the second one is in German so we can type in there or click into that paragraph tag and type in Lang equals de for German save this page refresh this page again nothing happens but the browser now knows that this piece right here is German search engine crawlers that visit this page will determine that this is German as well based on the Lang and they may treat that content a little differently maybe rank a little higher in in German search because there's German on the page and just to show you an example of the browser detecting what we're doing here if we set this Lang to French for example fr save this page refresh this page we have the Google Translate thing popped down because I'm using Google Chrome it's built right in so it's detecting based on this Lang attribute that the page is French and it's asking whether I want to translate it I have no French on the actual page but those Lang attribute tells the Google Chrome that the page is French but it knows I'm located in Canada so I speak English I was asking it for on translate and that's how easy it is to use the Lang attribute in your HTML I hope this video helps you if you haven't done so yet click on the subscribe button then click on the Bell notification icon so you notify when polish more awesome content and then click on that car that just appeared in the top right of this video for some awesome resources and until next time keep crushing it and I will see you in the next video
