welcome to the second beginning tutorial on JavaScript now in the last video I said we would be using notepad throughout the series but I kind of changed my mind because it's a little bit easier to use notepad plus plus with JavaScript now if you want to use notepad that's not a problem you can continue to do that but if you want to use notepad plus plus it's very easy to download and it's a very quick install in fact if you open up your browser and go to Google and just type in notepad plus plus you'll see it comes up very quickly here and you can just hit this download link right here and as I said it's a very very quick install now once you open up notepad plus plus I want you to go ahead and copy this template right here because this is going to be the default template that we'll use throughout the series and then I want you to go ahead and save as and then save it as a HTML document and I just saved it on my desktop so we'll be reusing this code over and over again this basic template now as I said in the last video our JavaScript code goes between our script element tag this is an HTML element tag so we have an opening tag and a closing tag and then everything in between is our JavaScript code now this is going to be a basic video we're just going to get started here with some very simple JavaScript code and also explain statements now as I said all of our JavaScript code will go between the script element tags and this is usually the place that you will put your JavaScript code now there are some other places you can actually put your JavaScript code and we'll get into that in later videos but for now we're going to go ahead and put our JavaScript code right in here and of course there's the body HTML tags and all of our web content goes in here in this area so let's go ahead and write some JavaScript code okay so what I want you to do now is type out document dot write and then I want you to type in parenthesis and we'll get into that later on what this is but essentially this is a function and basically what this allows us to do is write out any HTML content to our web page and I'll show you that in a minute it's going to be very simple and inside I want you to put quotes and we're just going to use the very famous hell world which is usually used in someone's first program so we'll use that here and then we're going to end this with a semicolon now since this video is about statements this entire line of code is referred to as a statement and what is a statement think of it as a little bit of code that does some work for us some computations so that's what a statement is now you could have hundreds of statements in your JavaScript code and we will eventually get to that later on now to end a statement you always use a semicolon and then you move on to the next statement so let's go ahead and run this and we'll watch this in IE now you might get a message down here that says allow blocked content and so just go ahead and hit that and so there you see our document dot right has printed out hello world for us and so if we decided to add more code this is going to be fake code we would put another semicolon you know that's how statements work they go in a top-down order so again the semicolon ends each statement and actually let's go ahead and get rid of these because we don't want to save that so in the next video we will talk about variables
