welcome to the eleventh tutorial on beginning CSS in the last video we created an external stylesheet and so we're going to go ahead and use that right now so let's open up our website folder that we created and we'll go ahead and open up our stylesheet now in this video we're going to be talking about the text decoration property and we dealt with that in previous videos but we're going to expand upon that in this video so I want to go ahead and eliminate this class that we created but before we do that I want you to copy and paste this into the h1 and h2 selector and actually we're just going to copy and paste this over the border bottom rule that we set we're not going to use that anymore and then we'll go ahead and eliminate this class that we created in earlier videos and we'll go ahead and save our stylesheet now and you can see that we have an underline on our h1 and h2 headers so that is the first value that we can use now let's go ahead and close that out now another value that we can use is the line through parameter so let's go ahead and put that in and we'll save this and let's go ahead and open up our HTML page and you can see we've got a line through our text now another parameter that we can use is over line so let's type that in here and we'll go ahead and save our style sheet again let's open up our page and there you can see we get a line above the text now you can also combine some of the parameters so let's put in here underline and let's go ahead and save this and you can see now we've got an underline and an over line and then the final parameter we'll talk about is none and that's pretty self explained because that's what we'll use going forward and let's go ahead and save this and we'll take one more look at our webpage and it's back to normal ok I will see you guys in the next video
