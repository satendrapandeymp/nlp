hello guys welcome to my channel this is a $60 in this course and in this tutorial we'll be talking about the pre and the HR tags in HTML now I've got a very simple HTML document here and there is no tag in this document that we haven't already seen before so on line one you have the doctype declaration then you have the opening HTML in the closing HTML tags on lines 2 and 11 respectively you have the head section and between the title tags you have the text debris and the HR tags and then in the body section you have the opening paragraph tag in the closing paragraph tag and in between that you have some text you know I have a story to tell you then a bunch of full stops and on the next line you have some full stops again and then it starts with a s and ends with a y with the you know more full stops between the words and and ends now if I open this file in Google Chrome this is how you know the text would appear on the website right so this is how it looks now let's say I want the text to appear just the way it is you know in my text editor that is I want all this white space you know between the you know period here the last one here and you know the first full stop on the next line to not be ignored but be significant so what changes do I have to make to this file so that this this this entire text appears the way it is in this file what I have to do is change this paragraph tag to pre instead of P right and I'll have to make changes to the opening as well as the closing positions I'll save the file and when I execute it now in my web browser I see that you know the white space between this full stop and you know the first character on the line is not being ignored now right so this is what the pre tag does and you must have also noticed that the font style is also changed so you know that's another effect it has you know it copies everything it would just take this text and it would put it on the website just the way it is in the editor right and if you want there to be some space over here too that is you know before the alphabet I what you can do is you can have some space here so you know if I get in a few characters of space save this file and if i refresh it in the browser and I see that there is some space here now right so that's about the pre tag and it's not really used much I just wanted to you know tell you guys that it exists and the next thing that we're going to check out in this tutorial is how we can get a horizontal rule or a horizontal line you know in our webpages to separate two sections right so let's say I have you know a paragraph of text here and you know let's say I have another paragraph of text P and then I can just call this second paragraph and I'll have the closing P tag here and I'll save this and refresh the webpage in google chrome and this is what I see so I see this text and then I see the second paragraph text now let's say I want a horizontal line you know between these two paragraphs I'll use the HR tag for that and it's it's very simple all you have to do is type in HR give a space the slash and then the closing angular bracket save the file and when i refresh it I see that I get this horizontal line right so that's how that's that's that's all I wanted to discuss with you guys in this tutorial I assume the next one in which we love check out more features of HTML and I hope you guys are having fun watching it rolls in this course and you can always send me messages in case there are things that I do not explain well do you guys and I would be really happy to answer your doubts in case you have any rights oh thank you so much once again and you may subscribe to my channel and I'll see you soon
