hey what's up this is Scott with level up Hudson today I'll be talking about fonts in CSS and how you can control what your text looks like by changing the font your size your style your variant okay so really the first thing you have to know is that the font properties start off with the word font now there are several font properties there's font font - family font - size font - style font - variant and font - wait okay so these are all of them and they can be used to do a couple of different things and you can even use them all under the property of font just like we did for background when we had more than one value for the property for background you can compact them all under the font property well to illustrate this I'm going to do some stuff first and then we're going to simplify it at the end okay so let's actually go to our site that we had been building and if we check this out by default it's one of your browser is going to be setting this text as I believe that said two times by default as for web fonts Co there's a few fonts that are going to be able to use without some css3 ad font face stuff which we'll get into later you can use for serif Times New Roman or Georgia and then sans-serif you can use Arial or vent our verdad and really you can sort of use other ones like maybe Helvetica but you're taking the chance that not everybody is going to have that font so you could have a backup which would be Arial so let's you know let's get into this and let's change this paragraph and we're going to make this font - family and we want this to say Arial and then comma and then we want to put sans-serif because let's say you don't have Arial for whatever reason it's going to pick just a generic sans serif or whatever your browser set to let's go to Chrome refreshes now we have Ariel here well that's pretty basic let's add something else here and let's add a comma we can add helvete it Helvetica save this and let's refresh and now inspect this it looks like we have Helvetica here okay and you know it's because I have the font installed on my computer it's able to use it because the site itself is not going to be serving Helvetica so why you could put Helvetica in here and or any fun really you could type it in as the the font family name and if you have it on your system it's going to show up but it's not going to show up for everyone okay so don't don't you know go throw on everything in here there are services that allow you to do other fonts other than the web fonts like Typekit or fonts grow has a way to do add font face for some more interesting fonts you can always check out font I think it's fun no it's just font squirrel comm if you come here you can follow the directions and get some font face kits and add some different fonts to your site but we're just pretty much going over the web fonts the the standard web boxes it's almost what you and it's really what people would use for a long time it's almost in the past few years have you been able to use other fonts through replacement methods and now you have at font face which is great so we have font family it's going to change what this is it's you can put backups you can have a whole bunch of commas if you want to have backup fonts and you know that way you can if somebody doesn't have that font or the fonts not getting served correctly you can have it still look okay so another way you can define font sizes with a different kind of unit called an M and it's an N is sort of relative to each other by default with your font size set to 100% for your body 16 pixels is going to be equal to one M so to illustrate this I'll have this be 16 axles and then I'll have the paragraph b1m okay and now let's come to our Chrome and you can see they're the same size so just experiment with them and check them out and we'll be going over all about the details once you have a little bit more CSS underneath your belt to take care of this so right now I'm going to set this as 1.4 m/s and I'm going to set this one in you know 23 pixels or something and fresh take that back on the 33 whatever just so it's bigger here we go just so we have some text here and like I said we'll manipulate this a little bit more in the future and go over some M stuff okay so what else can you do with font well we mentioned font a font family font size font style font style could be italics let's say you want your font to be italicized oblique or just normal those are the different properties so let's have our h1 actually this first paragraph will just have this B font style and it's going to be italic okay and now we have a semicolon come back here now this first one is italicized so that is one other property there's also a font variant which the only property is normal or small caps and don't use this one a ton either but let's go into it just so you can see what it does font variant and this is going to be small small caps and let's check out our Chrome as you can see the text is all like uppercase letters but the font size is smaller so it looks like the same proportional to upper to lower case but these characters are actually the uppercase so that's small caps for font variant and there's one more its font weight and final weight is where you would make your text bold so again let's add this to this first one and we can say font-weight:bold and let's go back refresh this now it's bold we can also use font weight as a number they go from 100 200 300 400 multiples of 100 and so 700 is or 400 is the same as normal 700 is the same as bold so the nine hundred would be extra bold so we refresh this coming here it's a little bit more bold than if you were to just type font-weight:bold so you can also have bolder and lighter or any of those numbers so that's font weight but like I said earlier in the tutorial we can actually just use the font tag to take care of a lot of these so let's type font so in our font tag we can go over the font style first so we can say talaq then we can space and now we're going to say the variant which we had before with small caps and then now we can say the font weight which was 900 and then the font size which all set to 1.4 m/s and then now we can have the font family which was Helvetica Arial and sans-serif okay so let's actually get rid of all this stuff right here I'm actually going to go this text indent and I'm actually going to get rid of this fun on the normal paragraph just so you can see the difference but what I did was I took what is normally one two three four five lines of CSS put it all in one nice compact line where you can edit it and see really easy exactly what your font is so let's save this and come back to Chrome and I'll refresh this as you can see it's the exact same all of those properties came out just like we have them when they were individuals so you might be thinking what happens if you don't want these small caps like what do you put here do you have to put normal here no you can actually just leave this empty and now they're not going to be small caps but it's still going to work just fine all the other properties so as long as they're in the correct order you can have or leave out as many of these as you want and it's just going to add the ones that you have here so let's go back here okay so like I said this saves a lot of space I'd probably recommend using this if you're having more than one property that you're editing at once let's say you're just attacking the font-weight or something for one particular part you can just use font-weight and go right ahead so use this one you can save less space you know if you have to type less it's you know you're not repeating yourself okay so that is the font property for CSS as always if you have any questions please leave a comment on the video hit us up at LevelUp tuts let's know what you're thinking once again this is Scott and thanks for watching
