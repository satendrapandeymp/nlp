what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your fifth tutorial in html5 and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about some styling using CSS and also the new version of CSS called css3 however I want to mention this first as you notice I ripped all the stuff out of the body and that's because I know we have a bunch of more tags to go over but what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be teaching you guys about styling and then I'm going to be going over the new tags and I'm going to show you guys how you can use them in conjunction to do some pretty brilliant things but first I need to talk to you guys about styling so we got that down pat so let me go ahead and actually I want to add some stuff that we can style so I'm just going to go ahead and add like three paragraphs and what can I write in these paragraphs let me just go ahead and copy these first paste paste and the first one I'll just write oMG WTF BBQ with a question mark and in the second one alright hi my name is spunky wasn't that the dog in Rocco's Martin life I don't know and in the last one or I love string cheese with a question mark because hey why not make it a question now actually what I like to do is I like to test everything out first like OCD style and it looks good so far so now since we have this main CSS file and we didn't create it yet let's go ahead and take care of that problem right now so if we go to file new we can just go ahead and save this blank file is and make sure you save in the same directory is your main HTML file just save is main and for some reason I like to use the drop down menu main CSS and save it so now we have our main CSS file and we can go ahead and move that back so let's go ahead and add some styles through this now I'm going to be talking to you guys about the old CSS reminding you guys about a few things and showing you guys how the new version of CSS has improved so remember in the old version of CSS we could have things called IDs now if we have a ID called to know we can go ahead and apply style to this for example anything with ID name of tuna would be colored red so if we take this first paragraph and set the ID equal to tuna and save hopefully when i refresh that first paragraph since it has the ID of tuna now has red font now we can also work with something called classes now classes are kind of similar but they're a little bit different I won't get into the specifics but basically you can also have a class of tuna and what I like to do is I actually like to change the color to make sure that you know just make sure that we can see a difference in we aren't just you know accidentally not refreshing or something so if we have a class of tuna and I messed something up and that would be because I wrote class instead of tuna now if I save it I'm going to go ahead and refresh it and as you can see whenever you have a class this can also apply styles to any element that has the class name that you defined now aside from that I'm only going to be talking about one last thing and that is that you can have something like this P dot tuna and what this is telling CSS is basically I want to apply this style right here to anything that has the tuna class but it has to be a paragraph so if you had something I don't know like in a span or something and it had the class of tuna but it wasn't in a paragraph then it wouldn't be affected so if you go ahead and say both of those in refresh you can see that since this first one is a paragraph and it also has the class name of tuna then that's why it turns blue now you're saying okay I knew all that this is nothing new well that is all the old stuff for the old CSS and it also gets applied to the new CSS however css3 also comes with this cool extra stuff and that's what I'm going to be talking to you guys about now not only do you have the option of ID in class but you also have something called attribute selectors and it's basically a new way that you can reference elements for example you can have something that looks like this P and have the attribute in there called name now whenever you do this basically any paragraph with the attribute name is going to get affected so if you look at this if you look at these three paragraphs this one has the attribute class and these two don't have any attributes whatsoever so if we go ahead and refresh this we see that nothing turns blue however if we give the second one a name and it doesn't matter what you set equal to set it equal to Larry or something you can go ahead and save that and refresh and check it out now since that second paragraph has attribute called name even though it doesn't matter what it's set equal to what value it is it gets affected and that's what we tell it right here in the new version of CSS css3 we can use something called attribute selectors so basically any paragraph with attribute of name gets affected now if you want to take things up notch and you say okay I actually do want to set that equal to anything with attribute of name whose value is equal to Bucky so let's go ahead and set this third one equal to Bucky and we might as well give this first one a name and we'll set it equal to Sally so now even though all of these have names only one of them has the value of Bucky which is the last one so let's go ahead and save that and refresh and see only the last one turns blue so that's kind of the beauty of css3 we can work with something called attribute selectors and what happens in that case is basically you reference an element by any attribute whether the attribute alone or the attribute with a given value and I know that I'm using name and a paragraph and a value of Bucky but this can be any attribute it does not only have to be name and also any element not only a paragraph so I guess since I have time I want to talk to you guys about one more thing and that's using regular expressions in css3 so let me go ahead changing name equal to let me think of some good examples okay bacon sub and yes actually okay once again my bacon and on G bacon tuna so I actually did pick those names for specific reason and you're going to see later on so basically in css3 you can use something called regular expressions and you guys may know about regular expressions from before but basically it's a way that I'm just going to go ahead and show you guys an example it's really hard to explain but you can have something called name and then the caret sign I think that's called the caret sign it's a symbol above the six on your keyboard and what you can do is set this equal to a string called bacon now whenever you set this equal to bacon what this little caret means is any value beginning with bacon and it doesn't matter what it ends in such as example of bacon sub as long as your value starts with a word bacon then it's going to be affected so let's go ahead and refresh this and we can see that the first paragraph gets affected because the value of this is baking something it can either even be bacon alone and that would be affected as long as it starts with bacon now that's what the caret means you also have some other regular expressions one is the dollar sign and what the dollar sign means is anything that ends with bacon is going to get affected so let's go ahead and refresh this and we see that okay the second paragraph is affected why is that because did bacon sub end with bacon no ended with sub didn't my bacon end with bacon yup bacon right there did oh em gee bacon tuna end with bacon nope tuna was the last thing and that's pretty much how it goes if bacon is in the beginning or the middle it doesn't get affected it only gets affected when it's the last substring of that string so the last one i want to talk to you guys about even though there are a bunch of regular expressions is the asterisk which is above the 8th on your keyboard now what the ash tricked means is as long as the string baked is anywhere in value it's going to get affected so let's go ahead and refresh this and we can see that all of these gets affected or get affected whether it's in the beginning whether it's at the end whether it's in the middle or even if you had just bacon alone like that and I save this in refresh it that would get affected as well as long as it has bacon somewhere in the value it would work out so I know regular expressions are kind of a topic more related to programming other than web development and to be honest you guys aren't going to use this feature all that much in what Velma you guys are probably going to stick with the basics and keep it simple but I wanted to show you guys that and I want to show you guys some of the powerful tools that we have when working with css3 so that's a little taste of that in the next tutorial we're going to be going over more css3 more styling and then I'm going to show you guys how to tie everything together so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
