hi in this particular video of HTML we will discuss about a very important tag that is for the hyperlink so the basically tag which is associated to create this hyperlink is called the anchor tag and is returned as a and this hyperlink is basically containing the location or the URL of the target location that target location may be some in some other web page or maybe in your own web page so depending upon the location you will just pass the reference of that particular location in your anchor tag and as soon as you will click over that link you will be in your destination as I said in the previous videos like whatever text which is used to create your web page is the hypertext and if that particular text some particular text is containing a link that will be hyperlink so here is the hyperlink which we are going to implement so tag for hyperlink is called the anchor tag as I just said contains the link to a target location and anything like if you want you can put an image if you want you can put a text as a hyperlink like you can put some images also when you click over that you will read some particular destination so let's see a practical implementation of making the hyperlinks in your web page so here I'll start writing the hyperlink with an anchor tag which is nothing but a that is anchor all right and between this closing and opening tag I will write any text like click here for tutorials point all right so I want when I user will click over this hyperlink it should reach the tutorials point official website so to tell the destination I will use the href attribute that is the hyper reference and here what I want to do I will take it to the www toriel's point.com all right it's not necessary that you should only take the world-wide-web path if you have some local webpages which you have saved within XHTML extension you can give the location of that as well so these are the external hyperlinks which you can make so let's come to the browser let's refresh it Here I am getting the text click here for two two rows point when I click I will reach the destination all right so here I have put the text between this hyperlink if I want I can also pass the image which I want to behave as a hyperlink so for that I will use IMG SRC is equal to images slash logo dot PNG all right so I want that image should come here height 100 pixels width 200 pixels all right so the target is still the same so let's save it come here okay I'm not able to get the image why okay so it should be s RC naught is CR alright so let's come here and refresh and here you can see the image is being displayed I'll click over it and again the result is same so this is how you can create the hyperlink for any text or whatever you will put between these anchor tags now what I'll do I'll try to make one more kind of hyperlink which is the internal hyperlink for which we have to create a bookmark so now let's do that so what I'll do I'll try to create a bigger page because bookmark is something which is the part of your page and you want directly to jump there so in order to create a bigger page what I will do I just put a number of line breaks alright so here I'm just using it like anything and now after that let's say I'll say it bookmark one alright and again maybe after that it has a lot of things remaining in this webpage all right now let's do one thing what I want when I click on this image or maybe anything which I have here as a hyperlink I want to come here so first of all I'll make have to make this as a bookmark for that I'll again you hanker tag all right I close it after this and here what I will do I will use the attribute called name so it is bookmark one this is bookmark one for me all right and I want to navigate to this particular point so what I'll do in this source I will use hash and then after I will use the bookmark name that lets the bookmark one so let's come back to the page let's click here just refresh it or at by mistake I change the image SRC but rather I should change the anchor anchor hyphens so it is hash bookmark one all right now it will work so there is an image this is a big page alright as you can see okay so I want to come directly to this particular point so let's see how I can come so let's click here and you see it is bookmark one and here in the URL as well it is hash bookmark one alright so this is how you can use the internal hyperlinks which will help you to navigate within your web page if it has a lot of content inside
