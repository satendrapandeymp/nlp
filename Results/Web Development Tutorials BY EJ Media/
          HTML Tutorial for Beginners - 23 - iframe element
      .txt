in this video we're going to take a look at i frame x' in HTML now basically a iframe is just another HTML document that we can embed into our existing webpage and you accomplish that with the iframe HTML element so again it's used to just insert content from an external source in this case we're just going to have external pages and this can be done for advertisements or navigation menus or images many different types of things that you want to bring into your existing web page and the benefit is you don't have to reload your web page you can just bring them in with the iframe element you don't have to load a new web page you don't have to even refresh your web page that's the benefit now you can see here we have our existing index that we've been using and I've created a couple other pages an HTML document called first and an HTML document called second and we're going to bring these two HTML documents into our main index page and as usual I've put all the code for these HTML documents into the description of this video and let's just take a look at these pages these are going to be very simple the document called first just says the initial page and then this document will say the second page very very simple and again we're going to bring these into our main index page now again we use the iframe element that's what we need to use to accomplish that now the first thing we want to do is set this frame border attribute and it's either a 0 or 1 0 means it's off 1 means it's on we're going to set this to a 1 and then we can give it a width we use the width attribute and let's set this to 200 pixels and then we want to give it a height so let's set this as well to 200 pixels now you could put in percentages here you could say 100 percent and 100 percent and then this would expand to the width of the screen but we're not going to do that now here is where we specify whatever we want to pull in and we'll come back to this in a minute we're not going to put anything in here for the moment now let's go ahead and give this a name and we'll just call this our iframe pretty simple and we don't really need to worry about this this is more for PHP and ASP we'll deal with this in future series but we do need to worry more about the ID and we're just going to give it the same name so we'll call this our iframe and we'll talk about this in a minute so we have this all set now what we're going to do is we're actually going to put some in here and I want to show you how this works so let's just put in some very simple text and we're just going to say do you see this and the reason I'm doing this is I want to show you that this content will not be displayed well very likely will not be displayed if you do see it it means your browser does not recognize iframes but that's almost impossible since almost every modern browser supports iframes but anyways that's why I'm putting this in here I want to show you that the content we pull in is from this source attribute has to come through here if we put other content outside the source attribute it will not display and so that's what I wanted to show you so let's go ahead and save this and we will open up our web page here and there you can see we have no content here you can't see anything you do not see this text if you do see it it means somehow your browser does not support iframes now you do see the border here's the border that we made and so you can see how that works if we set this to zero you wouldn't even see this border right now so let's go ahead and close this out and now let's go ahead and specify the content that we want to bring in and we're just going to specify our first dot HTML right here this is what we're going to bring in when we first load the page so let's go ahead and save this well refresh this and there you can see we brought in the first dot HTML and so again that's how that works so again this is the HTML document we're first bringing into our index.html but what about this second dot HTML that I created well let's go ahead and create an anchor link for that now this anchor link will be a link down here that we can click on that will load the second dot HTML now of course we need to put it outside of our I frame element so that we can see it so let's go ahead and do that and I'll just copy and paste this in here because I've already typed it out so here you can see we have the anchor element now remember this gives us the link here's the href attribute and we're going to point to our second HTML that's what's going to get loaded now here's how this works we use this target attribute and it points back to our iframe right so because of this target attribute this second dot HTML will now be contained within our iframe this is how it's done it's done through this target so these two have to match and then we just put some text in here that says switch to new document so let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh our page now and there you can see we have our link now what I want you notices when we hit this now we should get our second HTML loaded into this iframe but notice the webpage itself does not refresh let's hit this and see how that worked no refreshed it's just instantaneous so that is how I frames work oh I do want to point out one thing you will want to put all of these files in one folder you can see I've called this folder 0 1 so they all have to be contained inside this same folder now if you decide to go ahead and put these two documents somewhere else you just have to specify the path here you have to actually give it a path but if everything is contained within the same folder that's the benefit we don't have to put a path we can just specify the name of the actual file ok I will see you guys in the next video
