hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and this is tutorial number 45 and in this tutorial we're going to take a look at how to make text and password fields in our form so the text field we're going to handle first and obviously that is just a text box where the user could put in any information they wanted and they'd be able to see the information that they're typing whereas if the user try to fill in a password field the password field actually makes bullet points but basically these two fields are very similar or they're almost the same with the exception of a password field having those bullet points hiding away the characters so let's take a look at how to create one of these fields and to do that we're going to create an element called input okay so this is actually a single tag element so we can go ahead and actually close that off with our closing slash but this input element actually takes a few attributes okay and the first attribute is the type okay and the reason why we have to specify a type is because this attribute could be rendered as one of many elements okay so because we want this to be rendered as a text field we're going to give this a type of text and then I'm going to go ahead and give this a few other attributes because there are a few attributes that we can give to this input element so the first one is a name and this is actually required because whenever you want to send the data from this input element through to the server the server needs some way of identifying what information came from this element okay and the way it will do that is by looking at the name so if you want to give this a name then you could go ahead and give it a name of anything you want so I'm going to say textfield and more than likely you would want to give this a name that actually means something so let's say you wanted the user to put in their name in this input element so we could go ahead and say name just before here as a label and then that would be prompting the user for their name then we might want to give this input an element of a name or let's say we're asking for the user name then we might give this a name of user name so something that actually corresponds to what we're expecting from the user okay so let's go ahead and run this in Firefox and take a look at what that looks like okay so here we're asking the user for a user name and we have our text field appearing next to this so if I went ahead and typed in my name then I could go ahead and do that and you can see that it appears just fine okay but right now we can actually type in a whole bunch of mumbo-jumbo and it'll just keep going so you can see that I did indeed fill in quite a lot of data there so let's say we wanted to give this a limit like the user could only fill in 30 characters or something well we can do that with an attribute so if I go back to notepad over here I could go ahead and give this an attribute of max length and I could set that equal to 10 and that means that I'd only be able to fail fill in 10 characters so let's go back to Firefox and click refresh and now when I try type over here let's try fill in more than one cat or than 10 characters so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then 0 is our 10th character so watch what happens I'm typing but I can't put anything else into this input element so that is how the max length attribute works and again let's go back here and I could give this another attribute called value and value basically determines what the default value is going to be in this input element okay so let's say I give this a value of name then when I save this and go back to Firefox and click refresh well I'm actually have to rerun this entire thing because I filled in that already don't I let's just do that run in Firefox when the form first loads okay the default value is going to be the value that you placed into this value attribute and for the most part I don't think you really need that so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of that because there's no point in using the value attribute because you want the user to actually fill in a value and the last value or the last attribute that I might speak to you guys about is called size so I'm going to go ahead and open this or start this attribute off and basically what the size is is how long or how big do you want this little string how do I say this actual input to appear so right now it's at its default but let's say I wanted the size of this this okay well let's not make it a thousand this input element to be 100 okay then that means it's going to be 100 characters long so not pixels or anything like that but actual characters as in characters that you can fit inside of this actual input element so let's go back and click refresh and as you can see now it is much bigger so that is a size of 100 and if you were to type 100 characters out you would find that they'd probably fit in that size again if I made this something like 10 characters then it would be much smaller so let's go back and click refresh and now you can see it is quite a lot smaller so that would fit the 10 characters and if I go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 that pretty much fits our 10 characters perfectly and you're probably thinking ok well we're seven minutes into the video and we still haven't touched on the password field and like I said the password field is pretty much exactly the same as the text field so we could go ahead and duplicate this and I could say that I'm asking the user then for their password over here okay and they'll fill in their password but this password field can take all the same attributes so the name could be password because you know obviously the name has to be unique but max length could be the same size could be the same and actually you might want them to be the same so that they look the same the only difference that we have to then change is the type which I'm going to change this to password and what that's going to do is just make bullet points appear when I start typing so now that we've saved that let's go back over to Firefox and click refresh and now I've got my username over here where I could fill in a username so let's just say I fold in a username of Quinton I could then fill in a password and as soon as I file in a password 1 2 3 4 5 6 you can see that this appears as bullet points but other than that it will take all the same attributes or can use all the same attributes as a normal text field ok so that's all I have for you guys in this video and if you enjoyed it then
