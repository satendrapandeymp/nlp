hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number two and in this tutorial we are going to create our very first website using HTML and CSS or mostly just HTML for now so hopefully you went and did all the homework that I talked about in the first video where you downloaded a text editor so in this case I'm going to be using sublime and then hopefully you've also got map downloaded and installed if you haven't just go ahead and check the description of this video and you will find the links to download and install map and then you will be good to go who to follow along with this tutorial right so now that map is installed open it up and hit the start servers button that should open up your browser and it should open up this website and if I go ahead and click on my website that is going to open up the page where I should actually see my website by right right now I haven't actually created any website files so I've got this little index of okay but make sure that you are visiting the address localhost colon and whatever your port number is so you know if you clicked on the star service button in map then this button over here in the or this page should have open sorry and this menu item should take you to your site if for some reason that this menu item is missing I noticed on my windows videos this was missing then you can go ahead and just type in the URL and to get your port number it's always going to be localhost but this these last four digits could be different they might actually be two digits that could be port 80 so just go over to map and under preferences and under ports whatever your apache' port is here that's what you would type in after localhost and that's how you'd get to to this website or to this URL alright so now that that is all out of the way let's take a look at creating our first website so open up your text editor and the first thing you want to do is go file save as and now you need to save this document in a very specific space or place on your computer and that place is going to be applications and map and htdocs' if you are using a Windows computer it will be your C Drive and then map and then htdocs so pretty much similar except you're not going to applications you're going to go to the C Drive okay so now that I'm in htdocs' I'm going to save this file as index dot HTML now make sure you save it as index.html because MAMP will pick up if your file is named index and then it'll go straight to that page it'll treat index dot HTML as a home page basically so let me go ahead and hit save and now if I go back over to the browser and hit refresh instead of getting that index thing over here I should now have just a blank page because we've got an index file but our index file is also blank so what we need to do now is actually code something into our index file so I'm going to just start off by typing HTML and sublime has these really cool shortcuts and autocomplete options which is you know why I like using sublime but if I hit enter now that I've got this little drop-down list appearing it will autocomplete my HTML tags and so here you've got a bunch of different HTML tags so let me go ahead and just run through these one by one and the first one is a doctype declaration so this is a docx it basically tells the browser okay we're using html5 previous versions of HTML actually had a really long doctype declaration that could sometimes go over to lines where it was like document type equals XHTML version one point blah blah blah blah like it was super long but because we're using html5 the doctype declaration is super simple you just type in doctype HTML and obviously him it needs to be in these smaller than and greater than signs because all HTML tags are surrounded by these smaller than and greater than signs that's kind of how we know that they are a tag and how the browser knows that this is a tag right and the doctype declaration just gets an exclamation point at the beginning of it just you know because that's the syntax of it then the rest of them as you can see are pretty noble you've just got the smaller than sign the greater than sign and a word in between them so this first tag means that our HTML document starts here and the last tag means that our HTML document ends here so most of the tags that we're going to be learning about in HTML are double tags which means they have a start and they have an ending there are some tags that have our singular tags there's it doesn't have an ending you just need the the beginning starting tag of it but for now most of these tags as you can see are all double tags so our website starts here and ends here and inside of our website each website is actually made up of two parts so every single website has this every single website has a head and a body now whatever goes in the body is what goes in this big white section this is what the users get to see but whatever goes in there and this is kind of the brains of your website so this isn't stuff that the user necessarily needs to see but it is kind of stuff that your website needs to work one of these things is a title funny enough the user can actually see the title but it doesn't go within this big white space it actually goes up here in the opening tab of your website so let's go ahead and type something into the title we'll just say this is the page title and for the body I'm just going to type in some random text like hooray I just made my first website and now well I actually want to go ahead and indent this and I'll talk about indenting in just a second but let me go ahead and hit save and come back over the browser and hit refresh and now you can see that I've got this is the page title displaying in the tab of my browser and in the actual body of my website I have hooray I just made my first webstie so yeah typos are not worth the time in fixing but yeah that is our first website created and let me just talk about indentation real quick because you can see that our title is actually indented and I went through the trouble of indenting this text because it makes our document more readable so it's really just there for the human eye to be able to see your code and read your code a little bit better if everything was kind of munched up against the side like this I wouldn't know that my title is actually inside of my head I mean right now this is a fairly simple document we only have nine lines of code here so it isn't too confusing but if you get to having a website with 100 lines of code it could be a little bit confusing to see that this title was actually inside of this head tag or that this text over here was actually inside of the body which is why we indent code because now I know exactly that this code is inside the body and this is inside of the title oh this title is inside of the head and now that I've explained all of that I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now what you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little
