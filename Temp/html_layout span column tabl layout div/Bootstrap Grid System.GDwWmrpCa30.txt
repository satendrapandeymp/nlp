this is part three of bootstrap tutorial in this video we'll discuss how to create page layouts using the bootstrap grid system one of the very important concept that we need to understand in bootstrap is its grid system the grid system is used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns the grid system consists of twelve columns as you can see here this grid system is so flexible that you can create any page layout that you want let's now discuss how to create a three column layout using the bootstrap grid system the three column layout should be as shown here the page should be divided into three columns with 1 is to 4 is to 1 ratio one important thing to keep in mind here is that if we add the 3 numbers in the ratio 1 is to 4 is to 1 the sum should be equal to 12 because the bootstrap grid system consists of 12 columns this means if the left sidebar column is 2 units then the main content area should be 8 units and the right sidebar column should be 2 units so when we add these three numbers two units plus 8 units plus 2 units we get 12 units bootstrap includes several grid classes for creating layouts for different devices like mobile phones tablets laptops desktops etc the table right here shows the available bootstrap grid classes that you can use to create create column layouts ranging from extra small devices like mobile phones to large devices like large desktop screens we will discuss these different classes in detail with examples in our next video for now let's use this class call - MD - star to create the three column layout with that we want there are three simple steps to create the three column layout that we want first we create a container we do this by creating a development using the bootstrap container class all the rows will be within this container so let's flip to visual studio so I'm going to create a development and the class of this development is going to be equal to the bootstrap container class notice visual studio intelligence shows us all the available bootstrap classes this is going to create a container for us all the rows are going to within this container now the next step is to obviously create the row within the container to do this I'm going to create a development with its class equal to the bootstrap row class so this is going to give us a row the final step is to create the three columns that we want inside this row we do this by creating a development and setting its class to one of the available bootstrap grid classes so we can use any of these grid classes for this example I'm going to use call - empty - star MD here stands for medium device similarly LG for large SM for small and excess for extra small star here represents the number of columns that we want this new column that we are creating to span across those twelve columns bootstrap grid system for example if the column that you are creating if you want that to span across two columns within that twelve column bootstrap grid system then you use number two instead of star so first we want to create our left sidebar column so I'm going to use call - MD 4 medium device we can also use the other bootstrap classes like you know XS or LG or SM so let's use MD for this example and I want this left sidebar column to span across two columns within that 12 column bootstrap grid system so I'm going to use number 2 and the content within this development is going to be left sidebar the next step is to create our middle column which is going to be our main content area and we want that middle column to span across eight columns within that 12 column bootstrap grid system so I'm going to use number 8 there and finally we want to create our right sidebar column and we want our right sidebar column to the spanning across two columns so I am going to change the text here to right sidebar call - MD - - and the content within our middle column should be main content-area notice when we add these three columns together we get a sum of twelve two plus eight plus two now the bootstrap grid system is based on twelve columns so since the sum is twelve these columns will be lined up next to each other in a single draw so let's save these changes and let's view them in the browser notice this is how the developments are displayed let's apply some custom styles to these developments to make them look pretty to do this I'm going to add a style sheet to a project so let's add a new style sheet and I'm going to name this custom Styles dot CSS I'm going to name this custom class custom div and we are going to define a few styles for the developments so I'm going to include a margin of three pixels and I'm going to enforce a minimum height for the development and let's set this to 300 pixels and background color is going to be silver let's align the text in center and finally let's change the font size to large all right so that's a custom div class and let's include our style sheet with a no index dot HTML I'm going to place this just after our bootstrap CSS file and what I'm going to do here is actually move this content inside another development so I'm going to nest in another development here and the content will be inside that development and I'm going to apply our custom class that we have created to this development so the class is going to be custom div that we have just created let's do the same thing for the other developments as well so I'm going to move this to another development and the text here let's change it to main content area and finally let's do that for the last column as well and here the content is going to be right sidebar so let's save all these changes and I'm going to reload this page so with our custom Styles apply this how the page looks notice we have a three column layout here now there are some important points to keep in mind when working with bootstrap grid system to create page layouts rows must be placed within a container for proper alignment and padding so look at this we have our row within a container so rows should always be placed within a container for proper alignment and padding we use rows to create horizontal groups of columns so here we have three columns within that given row content should be placed within columns and columns only may be direct children of a row so all the content should be inside a column and the columns should only be immediate children of a row if more than 12 columns are placed within a single row each group of extra columns will as unit wrap to wrap onto a new line so for example at the moment if we add these numbers in our to 8 and 10 we get 12 so these columns are displayed nicely you know next to each other in a single row but what if the sum is going to be beyond 12 now let's look at that in action so when I change the sum here I mean the number to three so obviously it is going to be greater than twelve so what happens is this column right here will be automatically pushed on to a new line so when I reload this page look at that that column wraps on to a new line but the moment it becomes twelve you know it comes back to the same row so when i refresh this now it's back into its place so keep in mind if more than twelve columns are placed within a single row each group of extra columns will as one unit wrap onto a new line grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span for example to create four equal columns we would use for call - MD - 3 now let's create four equal columns that is width 1 is to 1 is to 1 is to 1 ratio here is the example that we just worked with now this is what we want to do we want to create 4 equal columns that is width 1 is to 1 is to 1 is to 1 ratio so our column should look like this now to create 4 equal columns I'm going to make each column span across 3 columns within that 12 column bootstrap grid system so let's flip to visual studio the first thing that I'm going to do is make a copy of this development and then change the class of all the developments to call - MD - 3 let's do that for all the developments so now let's do it for the final element so now with this change we should get four developments with one is to 1 is to 1 ratio for columns now let's look at another example is the HTML to do that now what we want to do is create 4 columns but with 1 is to 2 is to 2 is to 1 ratio this is how the columns should look like and to do that I'm going to change you know the first column to 2 units the second column to 4 units the third column also to 4 units and the final column to 2 units let's save the changes and when we reload this page we should get 1 is to 2 is to 2 is to 1 ratio so using the 12 column bootstrap grid system you can create any column layout that you want thank you for listening and have a great day
