alright guys welcome to your 53rd tutorial in yeah I think it's time to finish this bad boy up so let me go ahead and explain the last line of code in case you guys were just like cheating and kind of just picked up on this story what I did in the last line of code is basically I got the name of the item and I stored it in a variable called a so now that we have the name of the item we can go ahead and get the value of the item so let's go ahead and slow not bar I got a gets got beer in my mind let's go ahead and take the value of the item and store it in a variable called B now remember whenever we are setting an item we use the variable term excuse me we use the function set item whenever we are getting the value of an item we use the function get item now the function get item basically returns the value of an item which item you ask well we need to pass it in a parameter so if we had something like I don't know we had a variable named Bucky and it had a value of excuse me we had a variable called people and we had a value of Bucky we would pass people into here and it would return Bucky so now a would be people in B would be Bucky so now that we have the name of the variable or item and also its value we can go ahead and start printing it out on the screen so let me go ahead and in order to print it out in the right box we first need to access this right box right here and actually I can go ahead and cheat grab this whole thing CheY CheY so go ahead and grab the innerhtml and i'm going to explain this we can't just go ahead and set this equal to you know a single line of text like this because this is going to loop through let's say 10 times at the end of the tenth time it's going to say okay set this equal to a and B so each time it's going to replace the innerhtml so instead of just replacing it 10 times and ending up with a single line we want the innerhtml to be 10 line long so in order to do that instead of just setting equal to one mind we need to add that line on to this property right here so then the first time it loops through its going to be one line the second time it's going to be two lines and it keeps adding lines and lines onto this property and at the end you have you know hopefully a list of like five or six different things so now that we have that taken care of let's go ahead and start printing out these variables I'm just going to go ahead and print out the name of the variable which is stored in the variable a and also the value of the item or variable but I just don't want to print them out right after each other what I want to do is I actually want to add a little one of these so you know it just looks a little prettier and then just go ahead and stick on the value of it and after this since we're going to be working with a bunch of different variables I want each of these to appear on a new line so in order to do that just go ahead and add a break at the end and this is going to make them appear on a new line so let me go ahead and save this and yeah everything looks pretty good to go so this basically loops through all the variables you have stored and makes them appear on the new line so let me go ahead and copy the path to that and refresh it and check it out we got all this crap because I was testing it out in my last tutorial but I want to show you guys how this works let me go ahead and refresh this launching Google Chrome and I'm going to go ahead and store the variable a a save it in there B B save it in there c c save it in so instead of just storing one variable and its value we can store a bunch of different variables in their value now let me go ahead and go to my website the New Boston org o1 over its happenin on my forum any active topics looking cool oh you know this looks good how old are you the ID odda and now I got a you know what I think I'm going to go back to that website and check it out when we go back all our information is still stored all of our variables so if we were like on a website like YouTube and we wanted to keep a list of our favorites or more likely you'd be building something like a shopping cart and you want to keep the users items and maybe they went to a different website to compare prices or something when they came back all of their items are still stored for them and say they wanted to add another item to their shopping cart like tuna and I don't know maybe it was like $12 well you can store that in there too and then when you go to you know another website come back all that information is stored there right for you so again before with the JavaScript as soon as we left this page then all of the users information and data would get destroyed but now what you can do is you can have the user you know go to different websites check out different prices build a shopping cart and then whenever they came back all of their information is stored for them so we're saying okay so whenever you're working with sessions does it store it a day does it store it a week does it store a month well whenever we're working with sessions in html5 a session lasts as long as you have that browser open as soon as you X out of it like I just did look what happens we're going to go ahead and launch this in chrome again and we get a brand new session so let me go ahead and you know store tuna for $4 and apples for $65 pretty expensive apples this information is going to be stored as long as we have our browser open so check it out but as soon as I go ahead and close out of this browser then the information gets destroyed so that is how long a session lives it lives as long as you wanted to so now okay guys I'm done talking I am you know my throat is parched I need to go chug a milkshake or something so anyways I hope you understand that basically how to use the web storage API and when it could be useful whenever you're building things like shopping carts and stuff of that matter if you ever want to make a program where you know maybe you want to store information for longer such as like if you made something like eBay where you had a list of items and you wanted it to be saved there for like a month or YouTube like a list of favorite videos then you would need to use a database that would probably be your best bet but anyways for simple shopping cart applications and you know I don't know I don't know someone think of something else for me because I mind around a blank right now this is your best bet but anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
