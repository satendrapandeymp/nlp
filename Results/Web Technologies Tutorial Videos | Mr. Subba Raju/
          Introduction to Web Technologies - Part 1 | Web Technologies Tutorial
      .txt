hi guys welcome to nourish technologies these are the new video sessions on HTML Javascript and CSS in this video sessions it is a first video on web terminology before we are entering into web environment first we must know some kind of terms which are frequently using in the web environment area where B is passion where B is vast that B is everything no web no future every step inserted and integrated with the web environment in that web environment these are the terms every second we are using as a programmer as a designer as a developer as any kind of position IT industry these are the terms everyday life we are using right web every day we are calling almost all without using the term web the day is unable to finish what is web collection of electronic resources is called web where B is everything so this web concept first time implemented by Tim berners-lee he is the father of the Ben Weinman in 1989 first M he implemented the concept of web w3c World Wide Web Consortium it is a popular organization which maintains web standards compulsory we must follow w3c rules consortium meaning is a partnership a group of people available in this organization nearly 400 plus members available a few well-known members are Microsoft IBM Apple Sun Microsystems Facebook etc like this a different category MNC companies available in this w3c organization it was founded in 1994 by Tim berners-lee w3c main duty is maintain web standards visit official website w3c dot o-r-g for more better information third one network in common life diver day we are using this one collection of computers interlink together to exchange resources is called a network first network in the web environment or in the IT industry ARPANET Advanced Research Projects Agency network it is a first network developed between two computers in this network usually protocol is FTP FTP initially popularly known as file transfer program not to protocol later program converted as a protocol because every protocol is a type of program that is network definition simply collection of computers interlink together to exchange resources each other and fourth terminology almost tell everything internet international network it was a developed by winter self an American computer scientist he is a father of Internet and some people says internet meaning collection of TCP by IP communications protocols here a TCP transmission control protocol IP Internet Protocol so connectivity between computers in your network TCP representing connectivity between networks IP representing so collection of TCP by IP communications protocols is called Internet next one is email electronic mail services first time implemented by an American and after first of AB mail developed by an Indian the first webmail name is called hotmail.com it was developed by Sabir Bhatia from Chandigarh with an American the American name is called Jack Smith these both two members implemented electronic mail services it is completely working based on SMTP and a mime but webmail first developed by an Indian not an electronic mail system electronic mail system an American and SMTP what is a simple mail transfer protocol it is taking care of delivering mails between different domains my multi-purpose internet mail extensions it is taking care of transferring different kinds of data through electronic mail services and FTP file transfer program later converted as a protocol it is a kind of service to transfer files between intra and internet-connected computers telnet telecommunications network or telephone a network it is used to connect computers telnet is nothing but a simple way you have a client means a local host there is a server remote host we are connecting to remote hosts with the help of local host that helper is called telnet telecommunications network so with the help of this we are login into remote system with the help of local host HTTP and HTTPS one is hypertext Transfer Protocol means it is taking HTML pages and it is rendering HTML pages another one is it is transferring s means not security exactly it is s means SSL Secure Sockets Layer so both are doing the same duty but it's TTP is every request converting into encrypted format more secure format more cipher text format that is the meaning of HTTP so both doing taking requests and response time next one is mobile telecommunications in the latest era mobile telecommunications are rapidly growing in that rapid environment there are the different generations available every generation there is a kind of speciality 1g g4 generation first generation telecommunications available completely analogue basic telecommunications second generation completely digital based generations pre G completely related to multimedia services 4G long-term evolution without the help of cable broadband services speed we can enjoy in 4G 5g international mobile telecommunications perfectly advanced today 6g it is an in future but your available air fibre technology without recharging a mobile with the power or with a cod recharging also sexists telecommunications available perfectly it is advanced level so finally these are the different generations of telecommunications right now we are enjoying 4G first area means first era 4G having different errors we are enjoying first error for g m-- i said already very clearly that is multimedia services 3g and 4g is nothing but long term evolution LTE that is right now currently going on and next one is a blog almost in everyday life commonly we are hearing the blog what is a blog blog is nothing but it is a web page or a web site we are daily updating a very updated information or updated kind of articles faster displays for example how this first displays in blog actualities following one kind of order that is only reverse chronological order here reverse chronological means what latest updated faster displays first updated a last two displays for example we can try to observe what is blow so I am maintaining one bloke html5 css3 blog spot.com Ordnung only updated of my blog that updated article displays first imagine three months back I updated it displays maybe somewhere else so that means latest opposed to faster displays first post last displace this is called reverse chronological order jaded to a chronological eh-2-zed so this pattern you can you should remember so finally what is a blog blog is nothing but a web page or a website daily updating a web page or a website here every updation every post displays in reverse chronological order next one is forum for me is nothing but it is a kind of discussion online discussion website it is a message board a group of people holding their messages and converted conversion is nothing but a group of people doing exchanging each other so there are the number of forums available forum is free of cost as well as blog also free of cost next one add-ons additional feature to the web browser so addon best example any toolbar commonly ebay toolbar google toolbars games toolbars all these are comes under addon the best example of add-on is adblock err nowadays we are installing in the browser it's come it comes under add-on next one plug-in it is a kind of software additional software to the web browser best example of the plug-in is Flash Player Adobe PDF Reader these are the two best example for the plugins next one webpage web page is nothing but the pace which is able to open with the help of the browser the page which is a developer on HTML is called a web page these web pages are classified into two types one is a static web page another one is the dynamic web page what is a static web page a Paige where a user unable to interact directly with the web page is called static webpage it is completely developed on HTML and CSS and second one is called dynamic webpage these pages a user can able to directly interact with these web pages these pages developed on HTML CSS and JavaScript and next one is website commonly we are calling collection of web pages is called a website again website is classified into two types one is a static website another one is a dynamic website for example a website developed only on client level technologies we are calling static website a website developed a client and server-side technologies is called a dynamic website so websites are classified into two types web pages are classified into two types this is completely a basic kind of terminology whatever in this video session available every term is valuable and regarding this more information I need to show practically also in our daily video sessions right those terminologies whatever the terminologies explained to you I am showing on the screen hands-on and one by one just observe team berners-lee is the father of web and he's 13 berners-lee popularly known as and who developed actually HTML concept and who developed the concept of web environment who is the founder of w3c and his team berners-lee and another word I said about Vint Cerf American computer scientist related to father of Internet environment and who developed actually internet concept is the winds of father of Internet and different different other definitions I made but I said definition aboard a web mail first web mail is hotmail.com developed by Sabir Bhatia and Sabir Bhatia is the father of hotmail right and email first of all Malee's hotmail dot-com it was reviled by an Indian Sabir Bhatia and I said these three names male in the web environment father of bees Tim berners-lee father of Internet is Vint Cerf and father of hotmail is severe Bhatia so these are the terms I explained already and when we are going to HTML environment those terms you can take but HTTP meaning all that I said SSL Secure Sockets Layer whenever you are picking the lock symbol the related information it is showing you can also observe by going to site settings and otherwise details also you can click and regarding the browser's also when you are going to browse and on your net environment means internet environment browser is the major role how this browser is working an introduction to that let me explain one by one related to browser and I am taking to you the starting part of HTML and these terminologies very helpful to you to work with the HTML environment so I am starting initial stage onwards HTML so before I am entering into after these steady mean ologies HTML environment let me discuss about what is a web browser and how the browser is functioning browser is client-side lightweight software it takes HTTP requests from client to server it renders HTTP response from server to client is called a browser the browser information we want to view perfectly means I implemented already one architecture very clearly client server database first a client level there is a browser available once you are entering into client level browser just I entered any URL it is not a matter of Yahoo or Google or gmail Nareesha T is a that is not not the matter of what URL you entered some URL or the Macra what browser any kind of browser so once you entered as a user you type and immediately the request is coming from client to server the request we are calling as HTTP request once the request is coming from client to server server level technologies are taking care of the request and server level technologies are taking ASP JSP PHP CGA these kind of technologies are taking this request and checking this request really available or not using concerned database drivers inside the database the request available or not yes once the request available or not available not available we are getting the related error message available and both times we are getting HTTP response either success or failure so once available and the response is displaying in HTML format so finally how this three-tier architecture is perfectly working presentation layer business logic layer data access layer so my all technologies HTML html5 CSS CSS 3 bootstrap JavaScript jQuery angularjs etcetera all these are trying level technologies dotnet Java PHP CG all these things are server level technologies back-end main storage technologies all these are so my browser available client-side so client side request is coming from client to server server to the concerned DB again response from server to client this is a completely browser duty so what is a web browser browser is trying to sidelight way to software it takes HTTP request from client to server comma it renders HTTP response from server to client it is what exactly the browser and in this web browser different different browsers are there now in the market a few browsers which we are using major part in the industry Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer mini opera or opera Apple Safari like this number of the browsers available thank you for watching my videos catch me
