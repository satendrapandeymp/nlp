hey YouTube Halligan it's Clinton yeah and welcome to tutorial number 43 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys a little bit more about this forum that we've been working over working on for the past couple of tutorials so yeah we learned how to style it and we learned how to create a little bit of a form layout now we've only used an input box and a or yeah a text box and a password box for now so let's go ahead and add in a few more elements so the first thing I want to do is maybe add in a text area just obviously a bigger box that users can then enter paragraphs and paragraphs of information so adding another element to a form once we have this all of this at HTML set up is quite easy by the way this is all the same HTML as the previous tutorial so if you haven't watched the previous tutorial you want to go back and watch that and come back here and watch this one but yeah let's go ahead and copy this entire row so everything from for form row down to the ending form row let's copy that and paste that down here and yeah now we've got an extra form row so if I save this as is and jump back over the browser of course that just adds an extra row that looks exactly the same as the one above to our and a form so let's change this up a little bit and instead of using a another field of password let's add a message over here so I'm going to change the label to message I also want to change this for attribute to message and of course this for attribute and the ID of the next element kind of need to match although like I said I don't want to use an input element I want to use a text area so I'm going to get rid of that and change this to text area and then I'm going to give this a ID that is equal to message because we want to make sure that the fall and the ID match so that when you come back over the browser refresh and click on the label it's focus on the actual text area right so now that that works let's go ahead and give our text area and name as well and we can just give this a name of message right and while we've actually taken a look at what this looks like in the browser so again just refresh and you can see we now have a place for a name our password and our message if we want to place a message in here now by default text areas do scale so you can click on the bottom corner here and you know make it a little bit bigger so give yourself some space but you might just want to indicate to the user that they can enter a lot of information in here so you might want to make your text area a little bit bigger naturally now there are some ways we can go about doing that I think I have showed you guys Coles and Rose so cold obviously determine how wide our text area is going to be and Rose determine how high up we'll be so we can give this something like ten rows and 100 columns and when we save this and jump back over the browser and refresh our a text area appears nice and big by default right but yeah that might not be the best way to go about doing things we could probably just use CSS it's going to be a lot better so let me remove those calls and rows and jump over to CSS and underneath my input of type text and input of type password I also want to add another styling rule here for text area and we can give this a height of 200 pixels and a width of something like 300 pixels right so let's save that and jump back over to the browser and refresh and now you can see it's a little bit more evidence that we can type a lot more stuff in here right we could also give this a max width of 300 pixels so if we save this and jump back over the browser and refresh I think I can't make it any wide n-now right so that's awesome it just means that if you don't want the user somehow breaking your website by scaling this too big then you just give that a max width now something that would be a nice trick at this point is just to make these fields all the same length so we can go over to inputs of type text and input of type password and also just give those a width of 300 pixels as well so save that and jump back with a browser refresh and you can see that they don't exactly line up 100% and the reason for that is if we inspect elements over here I'm using Firebug on our input of type password or even our input of type text you will notice where is it yeah okay that's the input of type text you will notice that we have a border of three pixels to the left and to the right and a padding of one pixel to the left and one pixel to the right so that adds on a few extra pixels whereas on our text area if I look at that the border is a little bit thinner the border is one pixel one pixel and the padding is one pixel one pixel so to fix this you might want to just you know add a few extra styling rules to either the text area or to the input boxes to make them look more or less the same so I think what I'll do is jump back over to my text editor over here and under my text area just give this a padding of three pixels oops and that should more or less fix the spacing issue so now they are exactly the same width so that's cool right now something else I want to do is maybe just add a few extra elements in here so I want to add a select box and I also want to add in a check box so let's jump back over to my HTML and I think I will crop copy this password row and we'll just place it down here and then instead of using an input we'll change this to a select so let's open up a select tag and I'll give this a name of country which means I can change the label here to country I can also change the for attribute to country make sure that I spell that right and then I can also give my select an ID of country all right and then I can just go ahead and place in a bunch of options in here so let's create one option for South Africa because that's where I am let's create another option for India because I have quite a lot of you guys viewing me from there I also have quite a lot of people viewing me from the United States of America right it's quite a long field to put in here but let's save this and jump back over the browser and refresh and you can see that now we have a select box showing up with our fields but our select box also doesn't really match the width of these other items so you can go around playing with this and trying to style this a little bit better so if I go over the CSS I can create a separate styling rule for my select and I can give that a width of what do the others have 300 pixels and then a padding of 3 pixels as well let's take a look at what that looks like so it's come back yet and refresh and you can see that it has been made a little bit bigger we might also want to change that height a bit so I think maybe set that high to 25 pixels and try and get it looking the same as the others yeah so that is like that right okay interesting so the one thing I would want to mention about select boxes and also checkboxes and radio buttons and a few other elements is that they are a little bit difficult to style because right now every browser uses a different rendering engine and every rendering engine in every browser tends to render things a little bit so if you open this exact same form up in Google Chrome this drop down list might look a little bit different or the Select box might look a little bit different and there are some things that you can do to try and get them looking the same but they will not look 100% the same all the time so I think there are still a few rules that I can add to this select box like I think if we take away the border or if I set the border in here of one pixel solid and gray I will change the look of this just a little bit so now it's completely different right but yeah like I said there are just some things that don't really apply to a drop-down list like this just like if I were to add a checkbox in here so maybe let's copy this row with the password in here again and just place that above the country and I'll change the label over here to check box it doesn't really have to say anything important we can also just change the four attribute to checkbox copy that paste that in the type tapes splice to paste that in the name and paste that in the ID might be better to you know name this something else keys that way this one this one and this one would be different but type still remains checkbox but yeah anyway let's save this and come back there and refresh and you can see that I now have a check box in my form as well but then again check boxes are one of these things that like you can try and apply some styling rules to them but not everything will take because they are not like they are managed by different rendering engines in every browser so if you really want them to look the same in every single browser you actually have to make use of these things called layer masks and that gets kind of complicated and you kind of need to be more of an advanced use them than a beginner so yeah let me just add in maybe a height to the check box so I'll select my input of type check box check box right and I can give this a height of 25 pixels and if I save this now and jump back over to the browser and refresh you can see that the spacing that it takes up got a little bit bigger it takes up 25 pixels but the actual check box itself didn't really change so I could add margins and padding's to all of this but the check box is always going to be this tiny little block unless I use something called a layer mask but again like I said that gets really really complicated so I don't want to touch on that on a beginner level you might want to play around with certain things like this select box doesn't quite line up with everything else yet so you can't play around with that and try get that looking good but yeah I think for this tutorial I have touched on everything I wanted to talk about now that we've got all of this basic form stuff out of the way I hope to see you guys taking forms and actually putting them into a website so go back to my tutorial on how to create a basic website layout and yeah copy and paste some of this form code in there play around with that and try and make some forms appear on your website and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that what you still hear there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content
