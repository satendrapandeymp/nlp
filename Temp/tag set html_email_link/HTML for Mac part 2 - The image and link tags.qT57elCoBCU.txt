buddy this is at the grill burger here and today I'm going to be continuing my HTML tutorial series 2 part 2 which will strictly focus on images and links now my first video came out and it wasn't that popular but anybody that watched it thanks very much I really appreciate it thanks for all the likes if anybody liked it it means a lot to me that'd be I just can't imagine if this channel grew into anything bid that would be amazing for me but of course that would be in the extremely long run I'm just more focused about pleasing YouTube but anyway um it's been quite a while since I've made a nether uh I'm sorry let me another HTML video so I might forget some stuff some things might not work if that happens I apologize ahead of time but let's get started because you don't want to here we talk all day we want to get a new one all right I was kind of testing what I was going to do earlier so I want to get a new one okay there we go so just reviewing get a little flashback from the first video if you didn't see it we talked about how to set up a page and I'll do that really quickly probably should've time anybody share they pretty  okay cool so let's actually save this one image now remember you want to save it as an HTML file so when the computer reads it it will know to read as an HTML file but anyway let's uh let's talk about what we review in the last video we talked about paragraph tags and this is how you type stuff in a web page so any writing using a web page will be in a paragraph tag like this so let's save this and they'll be right here and here we go look see how it says hello right there that means everything is working fine and that is really awesome so as you can see it says hello because we typed it paragraph tag right here and another thing we know is our heading tags and we know that h1 is the biggest so if we do hello again and then we do a hello in an h-60 egg which is the smallest we we will see the difference refresh it and here we go so hello as you can see it's much bigger than the smallest heading so if you wanted things to stick out on your webpage this would be another option anyway so aside from all that the main focus on this is images and pictures so basically every website you'll come across today has images and pictures and any website that doesn't well let's just say it's not a very good website so we let's say we want start out with links I'm sorry why I do not know why I called this images and pictures those are the same things we will be focusing on links and pictures I that was a that was a brain fart of mine I'm sorry about that so let's focus on the link first so if you have a webpage that you want to link to another webpage this is how you do it so it starts out like this so we do a tag which is a space href href and we do an equal sign and then this is where we put our website so since I'm putting this on YouTube let's do this youtube.com suite and you know how we ended this another tab that's our closing so sweet now on our web page when we go to see this it will show youtube.com and that's awesome but we can take in another step forward a lot of times on websites you'll see things that say click here and things so we want to add that and I'll show you how to so instead of it just saying the link HDTV blah blah blah blah blah youtube.com we can say click here instead so people will know where to click so all we have to do for that is type click here and people want to know where to click now so let's just save that and open back up the reload and see see um this is where our link popped up where it says click here and we're wondering okay where will it take us all take us to you - except my computer's slow ok cool so we all know that it's working and that's awesome now we can focus is focus on images now along with awesome links that we can not do we also need awesome images so how to do an image it's pretty easy we just do image IMG source which we abbreviate as SRC and we do the same thing as the link tag we do the equal sign and the quotations so I was thinking of a cool picture at a post so I'm just going to use this YouTube picture it's quite big but it will all just show you how it works so basically we want to find the URL of the picture that we want so here it is and let's just copy and paste all of it so we just simply go onto here and right between these two quotation marks right here we paste our URL so yes that's very long but that's ok and we can close it like this but there is something a little bit different with image tags I'm not sure why you can research it on your own it's just something I don't know we don't actually have to put this in the ends we can make it actually kind of like one big tag if we do a forward slash and like that so what we do is we eliminate the image part and we put a forward slash I'm not too sure why but that works but first for just showing you guys how it is or how it works what you're used to I will do it like this so now we have our image source and this should display the picture I'm hoping and let's put this and here we go it's giant but uh so let's say you want to advertise YouTube on your channel well or YouTube on your webpage like YouTube's an opsin website you could put a picture of YouTube you could put your account picture anything and then they could say like click here and you're like oh okay I'll click there and it takes you to the YouTube so if you open up any web site promising you that they would have one of these too and it's just another quick tip of how to start your website and make it look good anyway thanks for watching this give this a like if you thought I was that awesome please subscribe and take it easy
