hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss selection list what is a selection list selection list is going to contain some list of options we can display the selection list in two different ways either we can display the selection list in a drop-down box or we can display the selection list in a list box if we display the selection list in a drop-down box user can be able to select only one option if we display the same selection list in a list box then user can be able to select more than one options selection list is one of the most important control of a form it is used to get inputs like date of birth or qualification details are listing out some set of items so let's get understand I am going to put a break tag over here then I am going to use a paragraph tag there I am going to write qualification I want to get the qualification detail of the applicant so I have written here qualification colon file save go to browser refresh you can see rich displaying here qualification colon then to create a selection list we are going to use select tag select tag is a pale tag so I am going to write SEL ect select opening tag then I write closing select tag now we have a selection list to this selection list as I told selection list is a list of options we need to add options to it if I just say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it has created a drop-down box if I click on this there is nothing in this drop down box there are no options we can options by using the options tab now option tag is the child of select tag option tag is a paid attack so I am going to write opening opt avoid an option then I like a closing opt I were an option in between the opening and closing tag I am going right here in turn or I can save in bracket PU file save go to browser refresh if you see now in the drop down box you have in turn PU 1 item is added similarly if I want to add one more item I am going to copy this and paste it down here I am going to same ug undergraduate file save go to browser refresh you should see now two items are two options added to the selection drop-down list similarly I can copy it paste it down and I say here PG I copy this paste it down I add here P dot ph.d file save go to browser refresh this down you can see in the drop down list you have four options inter you can select only one item out of it or only one option as I told if you display the selection list in the drop down list user can be able to select only one option out of the available options also we can give values to each options by using the value attribute I am going to give here value equal to in double quotation I am going to write in turn I am going to say I indicates in turn then I can give value for this VA lue value I am going to give here you that indicates you Z then I am going to give value equal to I say just P that for PG then for this I am going to give value pH that indicates PhD I am going to give a name to this selection box Here I am going to say name equal to in double quotation I say s LC T that indicates select qualification qualification now what happens when I access this name in code then whichever the item is selected that items value is going to be returned back in the code file save go to browser refresh we have here in turn if I select ug at Ematic alee u value will be written in the code when I will say SLC T qualification dot value I get you similarly we can display the selection list in a list box instead of a drop-down box to create a list box all you need is you need to add an attribute called as multiple to the Select tag if you add it what happens we see file save go to browser refresh you can see that now instead of a drop-down box the selection list is displayed in a list box where we can see all the list items as we have said the attitude multiple user can be able to select more than one items now more than one options now he can click he can use a shift key or a ctrl key to select more than one items this time if we use the name of this selection list SL city qualification dot value then it is going to return the array of values that is I am going to get I comma u if intern and ug is selected if all the I options are selected then we are going to get array of all the values I comma u comma P comma pH like that this is how you can create a selection list selection list is very very useful in application forms we can create selection list to get the data of birth we can create one selection list for date one selection list month one selection list for year like that I am going to remove this multiple if I remove this multiple file save go to browser and refresh instead of a list box you are going to get the drop down box by default drop down box is the display mode ug or a PG we can select only one hope you guys have understood how we can create a selection list and its applications for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and
