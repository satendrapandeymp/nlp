hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series from the past video tutorial we are discussing layout design by using table vs. div tags or web page layout design using table vs. div tags in the previous video tutorial we have created two web pages one is layout design using table and we created a table with some content similarly we created one more HTML page which is going to be layout using div tag and that looks something like this quite simple now we proceed further you can see we created a table which is having the width of 100% border of one pixel cellspacing 0 pixel and it has a Content main container in the table I am going to proceed further as we know that we can create or nest one table inside another table this is how we do that I create a table opening table and a closing table as I told this table is going to be main container for our all next tables so this table goes inside this table now it is going to be identified as ID h EI de our header this table is going to become header of our web page this is going to have one table row closing table and it is going to have one TD closing TD and in this I am going to write h EI de our header so we are creating one more table this is going to have few attributes first thing width I am going to set to 100% double quotation let's see how it looks file save go to browser and refresh you can see the table got created and it has a border also with the width set to 100% now I set few more properties I am going to say here heig HT height it is going to have 50 pixels file save could a browser and refresh you can see that the height got increased to 50 pixels similarly I am going to add few more properties to it it is going to have BG color equal to pl ACK black file save could a browser and refresh see that the table has the black color set - you can see that text is not getting displayed so I use it present font color white and here I say closing font tag file save go to browser and refresh you can see this is how it looks now let's proceed further and perform some more operations first thing you can see here we have a space between border and the content you can easily see that what I do is I am going to set the border first border equal to zero pixel it is not going to have any border this border is the outside border so I am going to set this also zero pixels this table has bada one pixel so I am setting it to zero pixel file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we don't have any border now let's proceed further also I am going to set if anything is needed for example I can say cell spacing equal to zero pixel if I add later any tdys then there will be a space between two t DS I do not want that that is the reason I am putting cell spacing also zero file save go to browser and refresh that is going to be our table header same thing we can perform with respect to Duval so how do we do that so I hope you guys have understood this spot without any doubt now same operation we are going to do in this page which is layout using div tag dot HTML page I am going to remove this main container and Here I am going to create one more day of tag closing div and this div is going to have a ID header quite simple you can see if you are comparing both of them you can see that I am converting the table to give in this place that's it and then inside this div I am going to write h EI de our header text I have written and then I am going to apply some styles on it style in double quotation first thing I set width is equal to 100% and second thing as we know that these are styles I have to use colon instead of equal to sign 100% semicolon then here I am going to say height H e IG HT height of 50 double quotation similarly I am going to say here background - see vuelvo our color of BL ACK black semicolon double quotation as it is CSS I must and should use colon instead of equal to sign width 100% semicolon height 50 pixels semicolon background color black semicolon file save and also you can see we have border of two pixels set here I am going to remove that because it is not required now we don't need border around the header so file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have similar kind of a look only thing is header is not getting visible here so I use a font tag again F or empty font color of white double quotation greater than sign closing content file save go to browser and refresh you can see the header is visible but header is not center-aligned over here you can see that but here the we align or vertical alignment is in the middle that is not necessary for us to modify at present if you want we can do that also by using a attribute called as so here I am going to add padding padding - top I add 10 pixels so when I add padding top 10 pixels then you can see what happens file save go to browser and refresh quite hight increment that you can see that the reason is we know that the height should be overall height of the div should be 50 pixels so I have to reduce it to 40 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see now I think quite okay I think I need to increase more padding top so I set padding 20 pixels or maybe 15 pixels I said this is going to be then 35 pixels 35 pixels file save go to browser and refresh white down I think those are perfect now you can see that hope you guys have understood how do we create a header by using table and how do we create a header by using the div tag what modifications we need to do the summer these two should be equal to 50 pixel because we know that padding also considered in box model to calculate the height of the development so for this tutorial this much is inner friends in the next tutorial we get more information and we proceed further in creating layout for more benefits please subscribe and don't forget to Like comment and share these videos with others keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much
