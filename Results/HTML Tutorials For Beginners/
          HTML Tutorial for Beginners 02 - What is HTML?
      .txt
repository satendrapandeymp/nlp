Wow yo people I am Sean from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 2 what is HTML now before we start I'm going to say this much this ain't going to be a big history lesson on the derivation of HTML if you want to learn that you're more than welcome to go and scour the internet for plenty of articles out there in fact what I'm going to do is pop a link to one of those articles in this video description so you can click that and read to your heart's content but me I'm just going to give you a brief overview like a bird's eye view of what hTML is and how it works with other web technologies and then we're just going to dive in and create a website from start to finish all right so first things first what do HTML stand for Lenny stands for hypertext markup language now this isn't that important to be honest but I thought I'd mention it anyway it's not a programming language it's a markup language and the difference is that a programming language contains off in some kind of business logic so say for example I do something on a website the website it says ok the users on this it reacts and it shows me certain content that would be a programming language or a scripting language that handles that kind of functionality a markup language like HTML is just a way of presenting content in a structured and logical way to a user and we do this using something called HTML tags and I'll talk about that later on just remember for now it's a markup language ok so HTML is what I call one of three awesome technologies and together with CSS and JavaScript you can create some top looking websites alright so there the three kind of core technologies you want to know to create some good looking websites so HTML like we've said is the structure of a web page CSS is more to do with the design kind of aesthetics of the web page if I want to change the web page color or if I want to change the font size of the title or the font weight or the font family if I want to move things around and position them different differently on the website then I'm going to do that through CSS which by the way stands for cascading style sheets and I'm going to do a course on CSS in the future the third one is JavaScript only small that the the interactivity or the websites brain so like I said before if I go to website click something and say for example a pop-up comes up and says you want to join this mailing list that pop-up is probably going to be controlled by JavaScript and like with the CSS I'll do a course on JavaScript in the future this is all going to be about HTML which is the structure of a web page now I mentioned before that we control the structure of HTML with things called tags and that's what you've seen on this page here and there's loads of different kind of tags this is just a few select examples and basically all web pages is a series of tags of different tags and on top of each other underneath each other and nested within each other and we'll go into more detail about how this you know how it's all structured later on but just know for now that everything that you display pretty much to the user is going to be within a tag right so some examples we've got here is a paragraph tag and by the way every tag normally opens like this an open angle bracket tag name closed angle bracket then the content and then you close the tag off with an open angle bracket forward slash the tag name then a closed angle bracket so the top one is a paragraph tag and that's going to be great for things like articles you can have the paragraph tag at the heart of all articles and so you've got the P for that and then you put the paragraph text in between the tags the next one is an anchor tag or an a tag and that's use for links so we've have got a navigation on the website and I've got loads of different links then I use a combination of anchor tags to display links to the user the third one is the h1 tag and that's to display headings and the range from h1 they're most important right down to h5 I think and they're the least important kind of headings but then we've got a blockquote that's great for kind of displaying things like quotes and finally the image tag and you're going to notice something a little bit different about this it's not going to close in bracket and the reason is is because it's a self-contained tag and that means that everything within the image tag is within the angle brackets that's all we need you know while the information is there to display the English to the user and I'm going to go in more detail about the image tag later on in fact there will be a video no doubt devoted to the image tag so for now what want to remember is that everything pretty much in HTML documents is controlled or structured via these things called tags and in fact what we'll do now is take a quick look at an example of a web page alright so here we are on the net ninja code at UK homepage and as you can see in the top left here we've got a logo and that's a h1 we've got some links here for the navigation we've got the title that's a h2 a thing then we've got some images here a link here and all this is controlled by different HTML tags and if I just right click this screen and inspect element this is going to bring open google development tools I'll just slide that over here and you can see this whole HTML document here it's just a series of different tags and they're on top of one of each other they're nested within each other and if we drill right down you can see at the heart of it all we've got these basic tags like the h1 tag for the logo like I said and a tag that actually links to the home page that's within the logo itself and we've got some h2 tags there some list tags that's for displaying list items and we'll go through all this later I mean you're not going to recognize most of these tags and just giving you a brief overview of how its structured and so yeah that's pretty much it so what we'll do in this course is we're going to go through a lot of the more popular tags certainly enough tags for you to kind of start making your own websites but before we do that I'm going to go through the syntax of HTML and how you kind of start a HTML document so we'll do that in the next movie I'll see you guys then
