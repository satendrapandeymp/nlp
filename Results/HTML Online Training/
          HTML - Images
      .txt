now in this video of HTML we will see how to add images in your web pages basically images are a very easy and common way to make your web page more expressive and attractive so images play a very important role in your web development so let's see what all options are available what all attributes are available with the IMG tag which will help us in adding the images so let's say a practical implementation of adding the images in your website so before starting by putting the image on the web page let's see where my images are actually located so here in the e drive in the folder Paul Ashley pages I have created my web page called first dot HTML and writer and the same folder I have a directory with the name images which is containing a couple of images that is the HTML dot jpg and logo dot PNG so here in this example I try to put this logo dot PNG in the web page so now for doing that let's come to the notepad plus plus and here I'll put the tag called IMG so here you can see IMG SRC so SRC is the source so here I will tell you the location that images that the name of the directory Here I am passing the relative path and that is actually the good practice so just try to put all the related documents images in the same location where you are putting your web pages so when you will move your web page it will all move together so inside images I have an image called logo dot PNG for any reason maybe for the network issue or maybe any issue if the images is unable to get loaded then in that particular case the alt means the alternate text will be there for now I don't want any border for my image so that's why I have put border is equal to zero and it will be aligned left so let's save these changes and come to the browser when I will refresh here you can see the image is being displayed if I'll make some changes in the border so you can see the border will appear around the image and similarly for any reason if the image is not getting loaded so I have just changed the name so the image will not come so rather this alternate text will be there in that location all right so let's get back to the image now if you want to change the alignment you can use the align left right by default it was left now so and now it is right along with that you can also use the attributes like height and width in order to make the changes in the height and width of the image by default the image will come in its default size so I want height to a 50 pixel and width to be 100 pixel all right so let's refresh it and here you can see the size of this particular image is altered so for now I am just using this image for the presentation purpose later as per the requirement we can also make it hyperlink but we will discuss all those things you know coming videos for the hyperlinks for now this is how you can add images to your web page
