another today's video is how to create a hyperlink on a HTML document so I'm going to edit this guy with notepad plus plus all right so I have a blank document right here and we're gonna put a body and we put less than sign a H ref equals and we put quotes and we put h TT pecan slash / deputy Debbie done the name of the website close that we close the bracket and then you need to put whatever text what ever text you'd like to appear open the open the brackets agin /a close your a tag save that let's do a control run that there you go so you can see whatever techs you'd like to appear was the text that appears however the hyperlink as you can see at the bottom of Chrome there when I click on it it will open in the window it links to my website so let's go back and show you how to do a couple other tricks there's the option to do target equals open quote underscore blank that will actually a lowercase that will actually open the target in a new window so let's refresh and click on it there we go pops up in a new tab in this situation there's a couple of other options you can do a underscore self but that's the same thing it'll open the same window that you got currently open there's a parent this is when you're using frames it'll open up in the parent frame and top and that's not really used much at all either so there's also target you can do the frame name so if you had a frame and eye frame in here you could just type whatever the name of the eye frame is and it'll launch it in that eye frame that's more of an iframe video there's also the option to include an email address so whenever you see male 2 : email at somewhere calm save that tree fresh and it will open up your email client I don't actually have an email client configured so you know wondering what you're an explorer we'll do ya because male clients not configured so there's that you can also link to a particular part on the page we're in which is known as a bookmark so we'll do the name of this file is index dot HTM and then you put a pound sign so move that out of the way pound sign and we'll call this bookmark save that let me put a line break and I'm gonna just paste some blank lines in here that's a line break and then down here we'll do a span this is the text to link to /span save that I don't think I have to page open anymore let's do it I so there's the text down there and it doesn't work as it is now so what you need to do is you need to put an ID on that span or you can use whatever tag you want basically the important part is the ID and that is a bookmark so we save that I think that was the name of it it's whatever you put after the pound sign so save that down here ID equals bookmark let's refresh now if I click it it jumps down there to this text that just magically appears let's go back up click it again and it pops up so hopefully you've learned something from this video and you'll learn how to make bookmarks and how to create hyperlinks better so thank you for watching if you've enjoyed the experience of this tutorial why not share it with your friends
