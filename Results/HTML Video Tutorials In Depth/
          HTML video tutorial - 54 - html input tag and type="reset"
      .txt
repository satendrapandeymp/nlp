security information you can use the method as I get in this tutorial I am going to discuss how we can create reset button and what is the purpose of the reset button to create a reset button we are going to use an input tag inpu t input and type we have to give is our ESET reset for a slash greater than file save go to browser refresh you are going to see a reset button here at the bottom I do not want the text to be displayed in this form I am going to use the value our ESET reset all characters should be in capital file save go to browser and refresh you can see that reset all characters are in capital now good this is how I want the reset button to be now what is the purpose of reset button reset button is used to reset the controls back to their default values that means let us begin here we have a text box by default its value we have set to empty that means if I fill anything here in the text box I say here manju then if I click on reset button you can see that the text gone this textbox is now empty similarly you can see for password also we have the value empty for confirm password also we have the value set to empty double quotations indicate empty text box or no value you can observe here if I say here ma and Ju Manju I select here also Manju MA in Ju I say here also ma and Ju Manju when I click on the reset button all those text boxes values are going to be reset to empty you can see that there are no values present in the text box similarly you can see for radio button we have by default a radio button meant for mail text is checked if I change to female and click on reset you can see that automatically the radio button meant for mail is selected same thing you can observe for checkboxes also by default we have checkbox meant for sea text is checked if I check more than one maybe I select C++ also and if I click on reset you can see that only see checkbox is selected if I select both of them until account reset you can see that only see checkbox is selected similarly by default in the selection list we have ug as selected if I change it to something else maybe PG if I click on reset button it is reset to ug similarly in the text area if we enter some text and say reset you can see that text area is now empty there is no value I can put here value attribute also I am going to say here VA lue value empty no problem in that file save go to browser and refresh you can see that there is no text available this is how you can reset the complete form back to the default values now when reset button is used let's take an example I am
