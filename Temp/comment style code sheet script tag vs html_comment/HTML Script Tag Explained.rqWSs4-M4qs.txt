in this video I'm gonna show you how to use the HTML script tag how to use it where to use it why to use it when to use it and we're getting started right now hey guys welcome back to another video it's be orange from higher learning lab where I help you code better so you can earn more for yourself for your clients and for your business if it's your first time here hit subscribe then hit the bell notification icons you're notified when I publish more tutorials for you with that out of the way let's head to the screen capture and learn how to use the HTML script tag so the left-hand side of your video we have a basic HTML page laid out we have the opening HTML tag we have the opening head tag followed immediately by opening closing script tags in this case we have JavaScript which is defined by the type attribute inside the script tag now everything we type into this area is going to be executable JavaScript as long as it's valid JavaScript and it's not going to appear as text on your HTML page you can see the HTML page over here so the stuff we write in here is not going to be appear on the page so we could type in the word hello inside this tag save it refresh this page and it doesn't appear because it's inside the script now the browser is trying to execute this word as JavaScript and it's not valid so it's breaking so nothing actually happens but my point is that content you write in here doesn't appear on the page so if we do have some valid script like say alert and we type in this is my awesome alert save that refresh this page we don't have this alert pop-up so we have some valid JavaScript in there now even though it's not very useful we still have valid JavaScript that pops up whenever that page is loaded and it lives inside of these script tags so you can have any amount of JavaScript you want in there if you start getting developing really complicated JavaScript code I recommend that you have it as an external file to keep it less messy if all you're gonna have is one sentence like this it's okay to have it in the head section but if it gets any more than that or you want to do different things in different pages I recommend you have your JavaScript in separate files and you include them wherever you want to include them luckily it's very easy to include JavaScript you actually keep this same script tag that you have and delete this piece here we're going to assume it's in a separate file and all you have to do is type in SRC equals open quote and close quote and then the path to your scripts dot J's file and as long as this path is correct all the scripts that are within this JavaScript file will be loaded into the HTML page when it loads inside of a browser so it's really quite simple actually this is this is very clean that's why I'm saying if you have more than any more than the line of JavaScript code you should probably put an external file is easier to manage it's cleaner to look at if you're working on the HTML page and it's just all-around much nicer and that's all there is to use the HTML script tag I hope this video helps you if you haven't done so yet hit subscribe then hit the bell notification icon so you notified when I published more tutorials for you and next up is clicking one of these videos that popped up on the right so you can further increase your coding knowledge and until next time keep crushing it and I will see you in the next video
