hi guys how's it going so in this video I'm going to address two common questions that I get and the two questions that I'm going to focus on our beginning related questions because I get this asked a lot from people who are just thirty now learning how to program or design websites and that is what is the best place to start learning how to code or you know how do you get started with HTML or did the different programming languages that there is out there and I know it can be really confusing because there's a lot to learn you know there's HTML there's CSS there's JavaScript there's WordPress there's PHP you know like a just the list just goes on forever so my recommendation for most people is to start off with HTML get a good grasp of HTML and then you can move on to something like CSS and my main piece of advice is just to just take it one day at a time because a lot of stuff you learn in these you know like in programming stuff like that it's not stuff that kind of like just settles in and clicks in right away you know it takes some time to learn and you just take it day by day and I'm actually going to give a recommendation of a great resource to get started with learning how to program websites and design websites and the first recognition I'm going to give you is to go on the internet look up three tutorials look up courses even look for paid ones I have paid ones myself and just look at some very beginner ones that keep your rate straight from the like a beginner you know nothing like I said focus on HTML CSS and just you know go through the courses do some practical assessments try to build some websites yourself try to build your bail out your portfolio portfolio and just take it day by day because it really does just take you know practice and time and then eventually over time you'll kind of get those aha moments and things will start to click in place at least that's what happened with me when I first started learning you know it took me a while before I kind of things started to kind of click on my head you need a recommendation we give you guys is I have a book here it's called HTML and CSS designed and build websites I believe the author is John Duquette and I got this on Amazon and I got a link for it you guys can take pcat if you want I think I grabbed it for about $20 give or take yeah it's a book about HTML and CSS and it's a great reference for anybody getting started now I'm going to take a quick peek here and show you guys what this book has to offer as you can see the pages are really well done the graphics are really well written there's a lot of text a lot of information and reference and it shows you all the different commands in HTML CSS how to build layouts responsive web design and even has a section on css3 and html5 as well and there's a lot of design theories and different things were like working with images and stuff it's a great book and it's a great reference and I highly recommend it for anybody who is just starting out with HTML or CSS I think together you can grab both the books for roughly about $50 but they're a great reference and I highly recommend them for everybody who's just starting off but again just go online look up tutorials and you know YouTube videos and stuff like that and eventually things will just click into place and again check the book out there's link for it in the description hope you guys like this video hope it helped you out and you know what just state stick with it and eventually you'll get to understand it and before you know it you'll be developing websites and programming online
