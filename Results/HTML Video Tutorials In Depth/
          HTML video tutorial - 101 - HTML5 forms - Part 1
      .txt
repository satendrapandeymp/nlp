hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss html5 web forms we are going to discuss what are the new web form controls are present in html5 HTML for web forms were having basic controls and attributes like text field password field radio button checkbox text area push-button etc HTML for web forms were not more user friendly any validation need to be done then we have to use scripting to perform validations but html5 adds new web forms controls to get more specific and variety of data not just basic text or true false values we can get inputs like telephone number email id URL date/time color etc html5 adds new attributes to design more user friendly forms like auto focus autocomplete placeholder attributes it provides the facility to perform validations easily bike by using required attribute let's have a demonstration so give so that we can get more information on web forms first of all I create an HTML file I go to start type here notepad I click on notepad you can see we have notepad open and then I write here typical html5 structure less than exclamation mark doctype HTML then opening HTML tag with the attribute lang equal to en then closing HTML tag in-between HTML tags I am going to use opening head closing head tag opening body tag and closing body tag in between the head section I am going to write meta Care set equal to utf-8 close then I set the title html5 forms demo closing title I saved the file file save as I saved the file at the desktop with the name html5 forms demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotation and save the file on desktop simple you can see that the file got created I right I open with the Google Chrome you can see that html5 form demo dot HTML page got open and here I made a mistake I'm going to remove that file save good browser and refresh ok now the code is correct now we are going to create a form first of all I am going to use a div tag opening div and closing div to enclose our form here it is going to have a style first thing I said the width of 500 pixel and I set the height let me set 1000 pixels and then it is going to have background - color of light gray semi colon file save full browser and refresh you can see that the div got created and in between this we are going to create our form so first of all I am going to create the form with the name frm entry ID also I said frm entry and then action we know that action is the page which is going to process this form and for that I give processor dot HTML this file is going to process our forum and the method of posting the form I said to post method which is secure closing form tag file save for browser and refresh Poly's well let's proceed further inside this I am going to use field set F ie LDS ET field set closing fi eld s ET field set is a sectioning element it is used to hold set of fields that's it what actually it does we understand file save good browser and refresh you can see that it creates a box something like this in between we can put different form controls field set is a block level and pair tag let me put here padding of 10 pixel semicolon file save ver browser and refresh it we got the padding around you can see and feel set has one child tag that is called as legend le GE and D legend and Here I am going to same here I am going to write basic inputs closing le GE and D legend if I write like that let's see what happens file save for browser and refresh you can see that on the fieldset the corner here you can see there text to create such a boxes you need to use field set and legends you can use other tags that we have learned like a strong tag to display this X little bit bolder I'm going to use strong tag file save go to browser and refresh you can see that text is little bit bored good then inside this field set we can put any HTML form controls later we create that I'm gonna create one more field set here I paste it down this field set is going to be for advanced inputs advanced inputs file save put a browser and refresh you can see that one more field set god created with the name advanced input set similarly I create one more field set this is going to be submit or reset form file save ver browser and refresh can see that three different field sets we created and later in these field sets we are going to add our HTML forms controls so let's proceed further we know that basic HTML forms already we know first of all I am going to create a paragraph which is a block level tag in between paragraphs I am going to add new HTML control or old HTML control Here I am going to use an act tag called as label and it has an attribute for it indicates that for which control we are creating this label for txt user name and here I write user name closing la de el label and what actually does is displays a text username : only thing is it remembers this label is for text box user name that we are going to create now here input type equal to text that creates a text box we know that name double quotation ID double quotation here the value is going to be this four value whatever is there name is txt username and ID is txt username and value for that is nothing close file save for a browser and refresh can see that in the basic inputs field set we created user name label and a text box their user can enter a text or his name and here we have an attribute called as max length Li ng th using that we can control maximum number of characters that user can enter for example if I write here 10 file save go to browser and refresh if user tries to enter values more than 10 characters it won't accept like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 now if I try to enter more I'm pressing 1 2 3 4 nothing is happening you can see that right it will not accept more than 10 characters if we set the max length property so here we have max length property that we can use to control how many number of characters that the input text accepts from the user hope you guys have understood it's quite simple I am going to create one more paragraph below this and this text is going to be 4 txt password so we are going to ask here from the user password so this text type should be password we know that and it is meant for the textbox password field so here I am going to enter txt password TXV password and value will be nothing and max length property I am NOT going to use for this file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have the label and the password field which displays star star star instead of the text but simple we know already we have learned these things only thing is we are performing in different way by using html5 field set legend new tags we are using to create forms it's quite simple also next I am going to create one more paragraph using that we can accept from the user the alternative values for example I am going to use a label this is for getting the genders Ardi BGE and de our gender and here I am going to write GE and de our gender we are going to use radio button so I am going to say here radio input this is our the be gender I am going to copy that and paste here our they be gender the ID is going to be our D be gender and the value is going to be M and here I am going to say this is going to be male similarly I copy this input field and paste it down this is another radio button this is our day by gender our DB gender value is going to be F and this is for female and if I save file save go to browser and refresh we get two radio buttons and they are not checked both of them are not checked so I can use the chaplet attribute CH e cked check the attribute to make one radio button by default checked in the beginning refresh you can see that the radio button is checked and now I can select any one quite simple next I am going to create one more paragraph in this field set to accept more than one values from the user I am going to use here checkboxes so here I say chk hobbies of the user I am going to get so here we write H o BB IES hobbies so this is going to be checkbox checkbox and the name and ID should be whatever is there in the label for attribute I am pasting it here checkbox Obie's ID ID and the value for it I am going to give is P for playing pla y ing playing and it is by default checked you can see and the next one is m for listening to music and i create one more checkbox so i copy that paste it down this check box is going to be indicating d for robbing file safe good browser and refresh you can see that now we have hobbies i think we have a mistake here i need to remove this gender file save go to browser and refresh now we have hobbies : playing music serving have created checkbox controls which are previous webforms I'm going to create one more paragraph below this so opening P tag and closing P tag this is going to have a label and it is for the txt a address we are going to get the address of user so here I say address : closing la vie en label and below that I am going to create a text area control closing text area and it is going to have the name equal to double quotation ID equal to double quotation and value of the text area will be nothing at present I'm going to copy this text area address for and paste it in name as well as ID and then number of rows it is going to have these ten rows and number of columns it is going to have these ten columns it is going to have wrap WRA P wrap I am going to set it to hard so that we can be able to get Enter key tabs the pre formatting from the text area file save / browser and refresh can see that we have the text area created and it's quite bigger let me reduce the number of rows to five number of columns to 50 file save for a browser and refresh so that's good and here his address he can enter in this text area let's add more controls I am going to create one more paragraph closing paragraph and here L ABL label for for qualification so I said SLC T qualification and here I say qu al ific ATI when qualification closing la BER label and here I am going to use the tag select attribute select tag I hope you remember we used select okay closing SL e yes l ECT select and this is going to have name attribute and ID attribute to that I am going to give this for I copy paste it not this one control C and paste it here also I paste it and then it is going to have child tags which are which is an option tag closing opt I weigh an option and the value for this is I that indicates in turn I am going to copy this and paste it down and this is going to be you for Yugi I am going to copy this and paste it down this is for P for PG file save and by default this one I set it to selected file save good browser and refresh you can see that in turn is selected and we can select yugi or PG whatever we want here and one of the thing is we can change this selection list to multiple selection by using multiple attribute multiple if I say this control allows me to select more than one inputs by using the shift key I can select more than one selections I can make or if you want user should select only one selection then we can remove this multiple from here file save go to browser and refresh now user can select only one out of three choice that is how we create the selection box all these things we have learnt in the previous video tutorials it's quite simple now these are the basic input controls that we have in HTML for web forms now I create submit and reset buttons in the field set submit reset form Here I am going to create input type equal to submit SUV MIT submit and name is going to be BTN submit' ID is also BTN submit value for it is SUV MIT submit close it similarly I am going to create one more button which is going to be reset button our ESET reset this is going to be BTN our ESET reset BTN our ESET reset ID and the value for it is our ESET heavy set file save go to browser and refresh can see that now we have BT and submit reset buttons if I click on submit' it goes to the processor dot HTML page which is not available at present if we set anything if we do any modifications if I click on reset form button you can see the form controls are reset back to the default values quite simple for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we understand html5 web form controls for more benefits and be
