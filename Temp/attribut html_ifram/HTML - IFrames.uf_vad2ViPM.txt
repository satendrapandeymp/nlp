as just now in the previous video we have seen about the implementation of frames now we will discuss about bie frames so basically the eye frames will also do the same thing that is in this particular I frame we can load any other HTML document but the only difference which we will see here is that we will not have to create a very separate pairing HTML document containing the iframe but in a normal HTML document itself if I want to pull for example if I am creating a normal HTML document any one particular section I want to play a youtube video so I can just put the iframe tag in my normal HTML document and that particular section whatever height and width you are giving it to it it will open the different window so let's see how to implement the iframes in your HTML document so in context of iframes as I said that we can add the body in iframes as in the previous implementation of frames it was body less it was just a frame set tag in the body area but here we will add the iframe inside the main HTML body that means you can do the complete page designing but on a particular segment if you want to do some other things like you want to show some video you want to show some other page reference then you can put this iframe so here in this simple implementation what I have done in this body I have put a couple of three tags here first one is a sample paragraph and last one is the sample paragraph just to check that apart from iframe we can put some more things in the same document and here in the iframe what I have done first of all it is SRC means which page of which web il iment you want to show in this iframes and then height and width of that frame so whatever you will put even if it's a video you can show it that on a particular position so let's come here in the browser and refresh it and here you can see document goes here document content also go here but here you can see in iframe there is the home page of sheet Orioles point which I sit here as the source so this is how you can use as many as a frames logically you require on a web page and can refer to the different HTML documents
