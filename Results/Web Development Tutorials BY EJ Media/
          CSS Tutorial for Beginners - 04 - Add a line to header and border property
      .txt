welcome to the fourth video on CSS in this video we're going to talk about how to put a line underneath the headings as well as how to use the border property and so let's go ahead and open up our source that we had from the last video and let's get rid of that background color purple we don't need that anymore it actually doesn't even look that good and let's get rid of this rule that changed the color to pink now in order to add a line underneath our headers we type in border - bottom and then we use our colon and then we specify 1px now that's for one pixel in terms of the width and then we can type in solid black now there are other values that we can put in here but I will go over those in later tutorials okay so let's go ahead and save this now and we'll go into the document and there you can see we've got our line now let's go back to the source and if you wanted that to encapsulate the entire heading now normally you wouldn't do this on a header but you just get rid of the bottom parameter and we'll go ahead and save that and you can see now we've got a box that goes all the way around this and so that's how you add a complete border all the way around but we just wanted a line on the bottom and so we'll switch that back to - bottom and as you're probably surmising you can do this you can put in a value here of top right and left but we will go over those in a later tutorial but I just wanted to get you guys acquainted with that from an early stage so again that's how you add a line so that's going to do it I will see you guys in the next tutorial
