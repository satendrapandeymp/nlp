hi guys welcome to HTML tutorials today we are in class 7 this is Anil and today I am going to teach you about block level elements and inline elements basically do and span elements if you go with the deck HTML elements can be grouped together with the do and span elements and his tml elements are of two types it has been categorized in two types the first one is inland elements and second one is block level elements inland elements some of the examples of inland elements are anchor track Bowl track image tag TD tag etc and some of the examples of block level elements are on order list h1 track table tag paragraph track etc so what actual an inline element and block level element are if we go with HTML inline elements first HTML inline elements or normally displayed without starting a new land so for example if we come if we consider this one a tag and be tagged and TD tag or image that if we use these tags in HTML then it won't occupy or it won't provide a space before of it and after of it I mean vertically it won't give any line of break before or after but if we concentrate here in this place you will tag h1 tag table tag or P tag if you use these tags in HTML then automatically what happens well line of break will be generated before the P tag or after the P tag before the table tag or also the table tag before the h1 tag or after the h1 time and also for ul and oil Ovilus it will generate a line of bread before and after the block elements so this would be the exact difference between in line elements and block level elements so if we go with the description part of HTML inland elements or normally displayed without starting a new line examples of anchor tag be tag image to actually Jack and his team of block level elements are normally start and end with the newline when displayed in a browser this is the only difference between block level elements and inline elements so span tag comes under inline elements and div tag comes on the block level elements we will discuss about those two elements in the next slide so span element span element is nothing but an inline element as what I have talked earlier if we go with the description part of span element in the HTML language span element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text span or do both are used for holding some content used as a container for text but it has some variation span doesn't provide a line of break before and after but do generally provides a line of break before and after that's the only difference between span and do span comes under inline divs comes under block level the span element has no special meaning actually when used together with CSS the span element generally span element doesn't have any meaning span element doesn't has any special meaning actually but it can be used with CSS it will get some kind of functionality that we can use with CSS if you want to apply some style attributes to a particular line of text then we can use span tag for that particular line object and within that span that we can provide style attribute with the help of style attribute we can render the output of the next in our way or in our own wish in which color we want or which style we want that we can apply to that particular text using span tag with the help of style time so only in case of using CSS that span may have a meaning and if you talk about div tag do element is nothing but a block level element so it generally gives a line of break before the do tag and after they give jack so in the history ml language development is a block level element that can be used as a container for grouping other his team elements do you can has a capability of grouping other his team elements within givataim so DV is a block element which can hold couple of or multiple number of elements within it the div element has no special meaning even also no special meaning except that because it is a block element the browser will display a line of break before and after it so when used together with CSS the development has also a style attributes to large block of elements it can be used with CSS to give some functionality of giving some style attributes for block level elements we can use div tag and the common use of the best and the important use of div element is it can be used as a layout generator I mean to design a web page to design a page it can the new element can be used as a layout generator with the help of div attacks we can design a layout for a page layout is nothing but for a pair generally it requires a header section body section and bottom section and also it requires a legend and origin so this kind of layout can be generated using big time and previously before Purdue tag we used to use table tag but table tag is not the correct way of using for layout of the page it is mainly used the table tag is mainly used to display the data in a tabular data or a form so don't use table tag for designing layouts of the page or website the best approach of designing web page is losing div tags and this is what the introduction of new and span elements so if you go to the core point of view of div and span elements and what we can do with new and span elements we will see with the core point of view this is generally a normal HTML program this is what I have done here some text without this text it's a normal simple HTML program I am copying some text on this page his word and if he closely observed if you closely observed in the HTML language and after this one I have manually hit the enter I have already entered and here also I hit the enter here here here and almost every line at the end of the every line I have hit the enter so I if I save this file if I save this file it's already same if I save this file and you feel if I run it on any browser today as for now I am using Firefox what happens but whatever the text I have kept in the body tag this is the body tag this is the text I have kept in the body tag but I have already formatted with line of break after HTML elements but if you see in the output after the HTML elements there is no line of break so what actually it means is whatever the text we put inside the body tag that will be shown without a line break if we want to provide a line break of HTML elements then manually we need to give a break there otherwise it won't treat it as a break if IQ manually a breakdown here and if I save this one and if I check it on the browser the outputs say here what happened the we got an HTML elements and after that we got a break so in the same way we can do breaks here so I am giving breaks after each and every line and if I save this one and if I open it in browser now everything was in a perfect formatting so now what happens if I want to place this everything the entire text into a group so what I can do I just want to make this entire text into some particular group or I want these first top three lines into a particular group and these top three bottom three lines into a part of a group and I just want to render these particular three lines of code in red color and this in green color so how can I achieve this kind of functionality in HTML so the simple way is by using div tag block level elements block level elements are used for grouping large blocks of elements so large blocks in the sense block is nothing but it's a combination of one or two lines it's a couple of lines is nothing but block so here I am using a deal tag and I am closing a div tag here in the same way I will hit enter and open do tag here I will close the div tag here and I'll save this one and I will check it on the output on the browser which is already same so what I will do is now I will apply it style for this div style equals to this is what style is an attribute of CSS scat if you have an idea of cascading style sheets then you will be easily understanding what is the style attribute and what's the purpose of style attribute don't worry design simple concept if you want to apply any kind of styling for whatever text you can use style that within the element so what I am what I'm planning to do easier I have just want this div element total this do start here and ends here so whatever the content inside this div is belongs to this particular do that so what I am doing is I just want to render that particular do element text in some particular color so what I am doing here style it pulls two codes and close again one one do one more code so that codes gets closed here within that course what will do is I will write color colon red semicolon this is what an attribute color is specified with the value red column and if you want to allow you another attribute like font - weight equals to bold semicolon now we will save this one see what I did is dual style color equal to colon red font-weight:bold I will save this one I will switch back to the browser and I will refresh this one see what happened that particular three lines of code belongs to faster do the color has been changed red color and the font weight has been changed to bold means Jax I'm sorry - no taps it's the boil is nothing but boldness means little bit stronger stronger than the normal font weight and in the same way of what I will do is I will copy this style attribute code and I'll paste for the second deal and I will do this as brain we and I don't give this as bold I will remove this one I will say this one now please watch the the top three lines have been changed to red color and this has been changed to break color and in the same way if I add some more attribute like font family font family equals to area this one see this is what Arial font fire to this it was in some other font and it has been changed to Arial this this is the way we can render the output by using div tag do tank is mainly used to group some of the some of the elements and also it's not a normal text we can group they can group some elements even within the div tag I just want to play this as an HR h1 tag and I will close this one I will hit enter here won't be a problem for us photography you enter also it won't take that break whatever the thing we do in code point of view that will not affect on the browser until unless it is there HTML predefined l or a predefined stand and I will close this h1 tag I will save this one the same I will what I will do is I will give a P tag here and I'll close this P time so whenever I am closing appetizer there is no need of using this be a time actually P tag itself contain an open break and close break what I will do is this one this is what the way we can do some kind of magic with dude and so if you go to the span tag see this is what simple code I have placed everything in this div tag and I just want only the particular line I want only this particular line this particular line through some format so what I will do I will give you a span tag in front of this one and it will throw this one and I'll go to the end of that one and I will throw the span tag and even for span tag we can do styling style equals to colon colon double quotes now I will do color as blue I will save this one and I'll check this on the browser see this particular line of text has been changed to blue color without giving a break here see I have not you I have used this particular line of text within the span tag span is an inline element so it generally not provides a line of break before or after so what happened in the output everything is appended to the prior text like after large level of blur large level of large blocks of content is the following is the prior text to this one and this text was followed to large blocks of content so if in case in case in place of this pan if I use do what happens you will check now you remove this pan at the end of this one and we'll give division now in place of spam I have used it and I will check list in the output I am going to refresh now see what happened it has been moved to the next line and also after table a line of break is provided before another common a line of break is provided and after using tables also line of break is provided so by using do the only difference between span and do is both are used for giving some styling for the text and also both are used to can hold the content or used to group the content but the exact difference between do and span is the is a block level element span is an inline element block level elements provides a line of break before and after but span doesn't do that and these are mainly used for page layouts and spans are not specifically used for page notes and my sincere advice is don't use tables for page layout used divs for page layout it will be a more dynamic than tables and tables are used only to represent data in a table format other than that it is not good to use for creation of page layouts and I hope today I have given a much introduction about to do and span and also give also give the core point of view and some work on do and span tags I hope you guys enjoyed this video thanks for watching if you have any doubts please comment on the video definitely I will give the feedback or answers for that thanks for watching bye back
