in this CSS video we're going to talk about images and text right next to each other I guess that's the best way to put it now there are many times you want to wrap text around images and so that's what we're going to discuss again in this video now as we talked about in previous videos divs are a section of your webpage and they kind of have a life of their own you can stick whatever you want in there you can stick images text video anything you want to put in there they have a life of their own so we've got our div and what we're going to do is place an image this image of Julius Caesar now if you want this image you can actually get this out on Wikipedia for the article on Julius Caesar and you will find that image it is in the public domain by the way if an image is in the public domain that means you can use it for any use and you do not have to provide any credit but again Wikipedia is nice enough to tag these images public domain and that means again you can use it for any purpose you want so I created one div and you can see that it closes down here and then I've got one paragraph where I put an image in the paragraph and some text and we want a bunch of text to see how this works and so what we want is this image to be aligned with the text now right now it's not because we're not styling this image we haven't added any CSS rules yet so let's just see what the default looks like and we'll load the web page here and you can see the image is placed right above the text but what we want to do is actually align this image with the text so everything aligns nice and neat so let's do that now the first thing we need to do is add a class or an ID you'll remember that there are two ways to do it use an ID or a class in this case we're just going to use a class not an ID and we're going to call that class appropriately enough image that's what we're going to name it and so let's go ahead and save this oh there was one more point one to make let's reload this you will remember that this is in the flow remember we talked about the flow and past CSS videos well this is in the flow and that is why this comes first and then we get the text but what we want to do is actually pull this image out of the flow and you'll remember the way we do that is to float an image and that will actually line everything up nice and neat and so let's create a rule over in our stylesheet and the first rule we're going to create is float left so let's save this and let's reload our webpage and there you can see everything lines up nice and neat but this text is very close to the image and so there's a couple ways you can deal with that and that is to use the margin property of the image to push this text away you can push it as far as you want some people want to push this all the way across the page you can do that or you can push it just a few pixels let's start out and push it just a few pixels so let's go back to our CSS code and let's actually push this out 10 pixels instead of 30 and we'll save this and there you can see now we have a little bit of space between our image and our text now if you wanted a bunch of space between the text in the image you could push this out 300 you know you could count the pixels it would be like 300 400 pixels and the text would be over here now the next question you want to ask is do you want text wrapping under this image if you do you can keep the code as it is but let's say you want all this text lined up going down the page and the way you can do that is actually push the margin of this image down so let's push it down 300 pixels and we'll see what we get so again we're going to alter the margin bottom property so let's save this let's open this up and there you can see the image kind of has its own column and the text is aligned very nice and neat in its own separate column now these aren't really columns but it kind of has the look of that and again we're using margins to push all this text to the right so that's how you deal with images and text in the same div and in the same paragraph oh and that's one more point I wanted to point out you want to make sure you put the image tag inside the paragraph tag if you move this outside of the paragraph tag it will not be aligned in fact let me show you that let's do that so we'll put this outside of the paragraph tag and we'll save this and you can see now that they're not quite lined up and that's because the text is all inside the paragraph block and the image is no longer inside the paragraph block and so they're treated a little bit currently and so let's go ahead and move that back in there we will save this reload it and now everything is lined up nice and neat okay that is going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
