hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 37 and in this tutorial we are continuing with our creating create a basic website layout series and this is actually part four where we're actually going to start working with the CSS okay so hopefully you guys have watched the previous videos and you have a website that looks something like this where we have our logo and navigation you know main section aside whatever in the footer at the bottom okay so let's just make sure that you guys are linked to your stylesheet so make sure that that line of code is there and we're going to style this content but the first thing I want to do is get rid of all padding and margins because if we take a look at this in the browser real quick you can see that there's a margin or a padding around our image which stops our image from actually rubbing up against the sides of the browser the same thing with our navigation and the same thing with these headers and paragraphs etc okay but the problem with that is this margin or padding might be different in Firefox than it is in Chrome and it might be different in chrome than it is in Internet Explorer and it might be different in Internet Explorer than it is in Safari or something so all the browser's could have all like all these weird different rules or different defaults and we want to get rid of all those defaults okay so let's go over to CSS over here and I'm gonna make a comment and I'm just going to say get rid of default padding and margin because that's the first thing we want to do okay and to do this we're going to use the asterisk symbol or the little star symbol if you hold shift and the number-8 key on your keyboard you should get that symbol and what that does is select all the elements on the webpage okay so basically every single element that you can think of that you put on this page will be selected okay and we can set this equal to margin of zero pixels and padding of zero pixels and that is going to get rid of all of our margins and padding so now everything's kind of rubbed up against the side here and I know that doesn't look very good at all but we're going to go ahead and put our margins in a little bit later on but just one else that everything will look the same in all the browsers we had to hit that reset into there okay so we've got margin and padding now let's go ahead and something actually want to do here is just take list-style-type and we'll set that equal to none so basically none of our lists are going to have those bullet points on the front of them which is a good thing because on navigation as you can remember was a list and we don't want bullet points next on navigation and we also had social links here that are in a list and we don't want bullet points next to them either so yeah it's a good thing just to clear those out by default and we'll put them in later on whenever we need them okay now the next thing I want to do is make sure that all of these new elements over here this header element this nav element the section element article etc I just want to make sure that all the browsers are going to display those as block level elements now most of the most of the new browsers will do that by default but just if you want to make sure that the older browsers will handle those as block level elements as well you just want to make sure that you do this so we're going to go ahead and say header and nav and article and I don't know what other ones did we have yeah section and footer section and footer okay and we're actually selecting all of them at once by doing this I'm going 1 comma X 1 comma next one and what we'll do here is just say display block okay and that is going to make sure that all the browsers will display these elements over here as block level elements even if they have no idea what these new tags are supposed to mean okay and the next thing I want to do is Center our web page because if we go back here everything is pushed up right against the side and you know I don't really like that I prefer maybe our website to go from being over here on the side of the browser to being somewhere in the middle being centered somewhere okay so to Center your whole web page we're actually going to go over to our HTML side of things and if i zoom out over here at the start of my body tag I'm going to drop down one line and create a new div okay so I'll zoom back in on that and I'm going to give this div a class of container because this is just going to contain our entire web page because as you'll see in just a second I'm going to highlight everything so starting from my beginning header tag I'm going to highlight everything scroll all the way down to our footer and I'm going to indent that all by one line so I've hit tab and I'm going to end off my div over here so this might not look like much but if i zoom out and maybe just condense all these things over here you can see we have this main div tag surrounding our header section aside and footer so in other words we took our entire website and put it in this big div which I called container so let's go over here and make a comments just to say centering web sites and over here we're going to go ahead and grab that div which I gave it a class of container so let's grab that and select it by the class and in here we'll give this a width now most web sites usually have a width of about a thousand pixels or 980 pixels or something so I'm going to give this a width of 1000 pixels just to be like I don't know have a nice round number okay and I'm going to give this a margin of zero pixels and auto now what this is going to do is leave a margin of zero pixels on the top and zero pixels on the bottom but the left and the right are going to be auto or automatic okay and what that's going to do is if we go over to the browser over here figure out how much space is on this side and how much space is on this side and then actually send to the web page for us so when I click refresh somewhere over here nope okay I didn't save so need to go back and save that because I didn't save the CSS file okay now when I click refresh we have our web site jumping more this way now the reason why it is not exactly centered is because if I go over and I inspect element element over here we gave this a width of 1000 pixels which means my 1000 pixel starts here and ends here so we've scented the big 1000 pixel div so hopefully you guys can see these little dotted lines going down the sides here but if you can't then another thing could always go do is maybe just add a border to this so border are one picks oh let's go to pixels solid black and go back to the browser now and hopefully you guys can see that we've got this big dip over here which is actually centered in the middle of the webpage now in the next tutorial we'll take a look at actually getting this navigation to get floated next to our logo and then we'll also try make our main section appear here in the main side of things and the side section appearing along the side over here so that's all I have for you guys in this video but
