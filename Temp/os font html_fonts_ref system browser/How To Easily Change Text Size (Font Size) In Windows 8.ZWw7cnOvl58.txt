hi guys this is rockin and welcome to the extreme advanced calm in this video I'm going to show you how to change the default text size or the font size in Windows 8 system prior to doing that let me show you what exactly the problem is when I visit a webpage as you can see the text here is too small and it's too bad in my opinion because of the default text size or font size in Windows 8 I would rather prefer to read the webpage at this size are at this size and it's a lot better okay so so let's see how we can do that and one more thing when we apply the solution know that it's going to change the font size or the text size of all the icons and folders and system so this font that you see here the size of this point is going to increase that this text is going to increase in size as well so it the new settings will be applied on your system and the whole look and feel the text he's going to change all right so to do this simply right click on the desktop and click on screen resolution option and in here click on the second link that says make text and other items large or smaller now in these three options you can just go ahead and select larger and be done with it okay but I find that providing a custom menu suits me better okay so I'm going to click on the custom sizing options and in here I'm going to enter a percentage of 140 okay again this value I find applying this value suits me better okay so you can tweak around play around with this and see what suits you better and change it appropriately okay once you're done with it click on OK now note that this didn't change the text size or the font size right now because we need to do one more step and that is to sign out of your that you're logged in right now and sign back in this is required I'm going to show you why that is because windows says that's the next step okay here is you will lose any changes you made to the text size okay now watch this I'm going to click on apply and here it is you must sign out of your computer to apply these changes save any open files and close all programs before you sign out now if I say sign up later as you can see here I clicked on it and it says you will lose any changes you made to text size or you will see this change the next time you sign in so until and unless I sign out and sign in I won't see this new custom text size applied to the fonts a high-neck icons and folder name so this is your next step so I can't show you by a little signing out of my account right now but I hope you get the idea just once you do this step save all your open work sign out of your account and sign back in and that should fix it you should get to see the text editor higher in a higher font for higher size or larger text so that's how you increase the font size or text size and Windows 8 hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did feel free to like it comment and subscribe your channel thanks for watching
