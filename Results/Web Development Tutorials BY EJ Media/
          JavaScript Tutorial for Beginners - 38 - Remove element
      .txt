in the last few videos we added an entire new section by clicking on this button we get our entire new section in this video we're going to actually remove these elements and so I've created a new button here that says click here to remove section and a lot of websites do this by the way amazon.com has a lot of this if you click on some of their menus they'll appear and then they'll disappear and and that's the main point here you can add and remove as many different elements as you want you can remove whole menus images texts whole sections and in this case we're just going to remove our section that we added by clicking on this button so if we take a look at the HTML code here we don't really need to talk about this too much we've seen this many times but here's a new button we're using the on click event and we're going to create a new function called remove header actually that probably should say remove elements but nonetheless it will work now you remember several videos ago I talked about the fact that the HTML code is loaded first our web page is loaded first then the Dom is created and that's what JavaScript of course works against is manipulating the DOM and remember I said every single element is treated as a node so this paragraph element it's a node this paragraph element it's a node and remember I said there are child and parent nodes so our div up here is the parent node and all these paragraph and headings are child nodes so that's what we need to do when we remove this element we actually can use a property which I'll show you in a few minutes that will give us the parent node and then we can remove the child nodes down here that we're creating so let's go ahead and flip over to our code and I've got the function here and we'll start filling this in so I've got the first line already typed out so I'll just copy and paste that now what we're doing is we're going to create a variable called element age so we're first going to remove our heading element and then we'll remove the paragraph element and we're going to use the get elements by tag name method and so this will give us all of the h2 tags on our web page but there's a problem here we only want to remove that last section the header in that last section now we could just keep this the way it is but it would remove all the headings and we don't want to do that so we need to specify a and if we go back here the position of that last header will be 2 this will be 0 this one is 1 and the heading down here would of course would be in the third position which of course is to actually remember computers always start from 0 they like to start from 0 so 0 1 and then 2 so let's go back over here and here's where we specify the position with a bracket and we just put 2 here and that will remove the third heading ok good now all we've done here is we've stored our heading the third heading of course in this variable but now we need to actually specify of course the parent node that we want to remove our child node from so we need to get that parent node first so I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste the line in here and what we're doing is we're creating another variable and this will hold the parent node and so we just specify our heading node which is element H and then we can use the property now this is a property called parent node and that'll just get the parent node of the heading node which in this case of course is div so that will be stored in parent and now that we've got this we can finally go ahead and remove the third heading and so let's do that and so I'll just go ahead and copy and paste this in here and here we go we now just specify our parent object we use the remove child method now and we just remove the third heading we specify that object right here and that will remove it and so now we can basically just use all this same code pretty much for the paragraph element so let's go ahead and copy and paste this in here and we can just call this element P even though we didn't do that up here but we can just call this whatever we want down here doesn't matter we'll call this element P and of course we need to specify the P tag here now I believe we had 4 paragraphs so I think this would be or 5 paragraphs I think we had 5 so we'll put a 4 here and that will give us the fifth paragraph to remove now I wanted to just show you this line here because we don't need to actually create this object we've already actually created it up here we already have the parents this object up here so we really don't need to recreate this that's all that was really doing so we can remove this line and we just flip this now to our paragraph element node and again we're just removing the child now from the parent which we already have created here so we can just keep reusing this object and that's the key to understanding coding try to reuse the object as many times as you can and in this case we're doing it right down here so let's go ahead and save everything up and if this works correctly we should be able to remove the section we created and let's go ahead and launch this in chrome and first let's click on the button to create our section and if we click on our remove section it removed it okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
