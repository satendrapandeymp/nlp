hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to my html5 and css3 tutorial series and in this tutorial series we are going to take a look at how to create websites using well html5 and css3 so let me go ahead and answer the question that most people should be wondering right now which is what is html5 and css3 so HTML stands for hypertext markup language and the 5 is simply the latest version so html5 is the language that web browsers understand and interpret when displaying your website and the name kind of gives away what this does because html5 is a markup language now markup simply means that we take all the regular kind of text that you would see on your web site like let's say you're trying to write an article and we surround that with these special things called tags and I will explain what tags are in a future video but for now just know that if you can read and write in English or if you can read and write in any kind of language you can read and write HTML it is that simple then the next thing is css3 which stands for cascading style sheet and the 3 is simply just the latest version of CSS so the name of this also kind of gives away what it does because it is a style sheet and what that means is that we use CSS to style the website let's say you want to make your text on your website blue that would be controlled by CSS if you want to add a background image then that would also be controlled with CSS so now that you know what CSS is let's move on to the next question that most people should be wondering which is what do I need to follow along with this tutorial series so the first thing you're going to need is a good browser now Google Chrome and Firefox and Safari are probably the best out of all of please do not use internet explorer or internet edge the both of these kind of have like a track record of not being very reliable and no internet edge is a little bit better but if it has this little esign please don't use it okay so a good browser again is something like Firefox Chrome or Safari the next thing you're going to need is a good text editor personally I use sublime text which is my favorite and it is the text editor that I will be using in this tutorial series but if you want to use something like atom or notepad plus plus go ahead and do that they are relatively good or they're actually quite good but please make sure whatever text editor you're using it has things like syntax highlighting and so on so don't go ahead and use some simple program like TextEdit or notepad on windows please don't use those okay then the last thing you're going to need is some sort of Apache software and I've outlined a map for this because I have tutorials on how to download and install map and I will be linking to those in the description of this video but yeah go ahead download and install a map it is a server or it is a program that'll turn your computer into a server so we can simulate a server environment it's not going to turn your website into a live so that will allow you to display with your websites to the entire world but it simulates a server so that the website that you build in this tutorial series will work the same on this server as it does on any kind of Apache Linux hosted server that you might want to use in future so your homework between this tutorial and the next tutorial is really to go ahead and download a text editor in my case like I said I'm using sublime so go ahead and download that if you want to use the same text editor as me I will leave a link to this website in the description and then you also want to go ahead and download map now I have a video explaining how to download and install map and I will link to those videos in the description because there is actually one for Windows and one for Mac uses so go ahead and check those videos out and then you can come back and watch the next tutorial where we are going to learn how to actually code something I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me out on patreon you can also check me out on social media I will leave the links next to me so go ahead and click on something and I'll see you guys next time
