today I'm going to talk about meta tags inside HTML and meta tags is something used not to add extra information to your website and we already talked about a few of these in the beginning of this course which was the utf-8 meta tag we used inside the head tag and we also talked about the title tag so we already talked about few of these and in this episode I'm gonna get a bit more into a couple of meta tags I think it should include inside your website each time you create a new website so the first thing I want to mention is that some meta tags can help improve something called seal inside your website now Co stands for search engine optimization and is something that helps search engines such as Google figure out if your website is relevant to what people search for inside the search field so it's important that we have good seal inside a website and again like I said it's only some of the meta tags that can help improve seal and I don't want to give you the idea that all these meta tags can help improve their overall see of your website so it's only some of them now there's a lot of different types of meta tags we can use inside a website some of them are infamously used or spammed into the website mode to increase you but it's important don't just include all of them just because you can you only need to add to once that you should be using inside the website so if you have something that you think is relevant to the website then we can go ahead and add it but don't just add it just because you can so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you a couple examples of meta tags that I think are very important for you to include in all websites you create and the first one I'm going to show is when we're already talked about which is the one called char set so I'm going to create a meta tag click tap to get the shortcut I'm just gonna go and delete the name here because we don't need it and I'm gonna go ahead and delete the content because you don't need that as well and I'm just gonna go and include char set kind of set equal to double quotes utf-8 and this just defines what kind of characters we're using inside the website and it's something that you should have inside all websites now the next one is going to be the title now the title is not really a meta tag but there's something I think it's important that you have inside the head tag because it's not really required that you have the title tag so I'm just gonna go ahead and say this is my website there we go then underneath the char said we're going to include a description tag or description metatag so I'm gonna create a meta tag again and inside the name I'm going to write description like so and inside the content attribute we're going to write the actual value of this meta tag so we're going to write the actual description inside the constant here so we could say this is a website that teaches HTML and CSS and it's very important to point out that we can't have more than 160 characters inside this meta tag so 160 is the maximum okay now one thing about the content inside this specific meta tag is that if you were to again see you optimize your website as good as possible so that people can easier find your website inside Google then it's a good idea to use keywords that are used often when people search for websites and you should also keep in mind that we also want to use words that are not that competitive inside the internet so if it were to use something like tutorials as a word inside my description then a lot of websites might have a description that says tutorials inside of it so it's very competitive and you might disappear among all the other websites oh and again now I'm sort of getting into sale which is not what I want to do in this episode but just understand that the description here is to just explain what exactly your website does and make sure use words that you want to be found for inside Google now the next one is one that is very important to have inside all web sites as well which is to viewport now the viewport goes in and makes sure that if you were to have any kind of media queries inside your CSS file you know we can make websites responsive then it's very important that you have this tag inside the head tag otherwise the responsiveness is not going to work inside the browser so I'm going to write a meta tag again click tap and inside the name we're going to write viewport then inside the content we're going to go and write with equal to device - with comma space initial - scale equals 1 and again if you're a bit confused about what exactly this means inside the content attribute then go ahead and watch the responsiveness episode I made not many episodes to go inside this course here so these are the required meta tags that I think you should have inside a website we do of course also have some other optional ones that we could use and again some could say these halls are optional but I think it's really important to have these inside the website most people will tell the same when it comes to meta tags now a couple of optional ones that he could have is for example keywords now it's very important to point out that when we use the meta tag keywords this is a tag that is very infamously used inside websites because keywords again like inside the description is used to write keywords for that specific website that you're making so if this website is about coding and tutorials I would say coding comma tutorials comma HTML comma CSS and so on and so on and so on in order to describe what exactly is inside this website here and it's very important for me to point out that if you were to use this meta tag to increase you inside the website then it's not gonna make a difference Google and all the other major search engines out there not gonna care if you have a meta keywords inside your website because it's something that people have spammed so many times over the years that it's no longer seen as relevant so the reason I include this is because it might still have some devices of some kind of machines out there that still counts keywords as a part of the the meta tag description inside the website now I don't think it's really gonna matter in our case so it's really an optional one you can include if you want to target specific machines out there that might still exist and where it counts but I don't think it's necessary the next one I want to talk about this one called author which describes who actually made this website so could say author and inside the content I could write my name if one and two Daniel Nelson but again like I said this is not really going to have that much of an impact when it comes to Cu or something else it's just a way to give some information about the website so these are some of the meta tags that I think are very important to have inside a website before you upload it to the Internet so too important that he had the necessary metatags now there is of course a lot more methods actually could use and I'm gonna go and leave a link in the description where you can look at some in different meta text that we have out there and I'm also gonna go and leave a link to a co optimization chart that we use in order to determine Co optimization for a website and again this is not really something that is directly related to meta tags but if you're curious and you want to look a bit into Cu and how you can improve your chances of showing up inside Google if somebody searches for a website or something related to it then go ahead and take out that link so this is all one to talk about this episode and the next one we're gonna talk about some good conventions and rules that you should follow many code websites and after that one we're gonna talk about how to upload a website to the Internet so if you're all enjoyed and I'll see you next time [Music]
