in this video we're going to go ahead and take a look at a few more elements that you can use with your HTML forms and that is the fieldset element and the legend element but before we do that let's actually go ahead and add another text box here just so we can make the form a little bit larger and let's go ahead and just add a line break and let's just go ahead and add another one and we'll just create a text box to hold a name and of course we need an input element and let's just go ahead and save this will refresh our page and there it is good so our forms a little bit bigger now now first let's go ahead and add the fieldset element and what that does is it adds some nice styling to your form and what it will do is it will actually draw a box around our entire form so what we want to do is nest all of our input elements inside the fieldset element so let's go ahead and create the fieldset element and that's all you need and let's go ahead and close it out down here alright so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get and there you can see we've got this nice box now around our entire form now we can also put a caption inside of the fieldset element so it'll go right inside this box so let's say we want to actually move this this part where it says enter day you want to travel a cancun that'll actually look nicer if we put it inside the fieldset box so let's go ahead and do that so we do that with the legend element so let's go ahead and create it and let's go ahead and close it right here so let's go ahead and save this and we'll see what we get there we go see how nice that looks so this really adds a lot of pizzazz to your forms okay that's going to do it for forms in HTML we're going to move on to another subject in the next video thank you
