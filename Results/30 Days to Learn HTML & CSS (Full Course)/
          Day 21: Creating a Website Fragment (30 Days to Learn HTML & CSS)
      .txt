whoo welcome back and today we're going to take a look at fragments and this will teach you the beginning process of converting designs to HTML and CSS so let's open up net touch and notice here that we have an article for each posting so if we scroll down here you can see that they all are duplicated you have your image then you have some meta information with the category the tag we have the title some information about who posted it and when and then you have two paragraphs as well as a continue link so our job today is to recreate this exact bit of code from scratch and this will be a good time for you to see if you can do it on your own so if you'd like pause this video and try to convert any one of these fragments you don't need the whole website just this simple fragment here see if you can recreate that on your own and when you're ready let's get started and let's get started so the first step is we need to get any images that we require and the only one in this case is right here so I'm going to right click and choose save image as and it's going to go into our working directory images folder and I will call this thumbnail okay good that's been saved and now really that's all we need the next steps is to create the markup so I'm going to open up sublime text and I'm going to move each of these to the left and to the right respectively and now we'll get started if I open up index.html I can hide the sidebar by typing command K command B or by going to view sidebar hide sidebar so the first thing is we know this is an article each of these are articles so it makes sense to wrap them within an html5 article element now within it we first need the thumbnail so we'll do that now we know to create an image tag and that's going to link to the IMG directory and let's see what we called it thumb dot PNG and we always have to provided alternate text as well and the alternate text is going to be the name of the posting next I'm going to copy this because I'm going to reuse it right here so we will place the title within an h2 tag now we could do h1 if we want but I think in this case we'll stick with h2 and I'll paste that in like so if we want to clean this up maybe put this on its own line because we don't have too much real estate here ok so now we have the thumbnail and the image but we also need to have the meta information at the top and I'll create a ul with a class of meta now notice that I'm using list items here because this is a list of information about our post next we have a list item and we have articles notice I'm getting it from right here and the next list item is called web roundups but before we move ahead notice that these are clickable links so I need to go ahead and add an anchor tag and I'll have it linked to nowhere for the time being now I can duplicate this and we'll do the next one which is web roundups and we will skip the writing because the framework that this website is built on WordPress uses a plug-in for that and that's beyond the scope of this tutorial so we'll skip that part so now we have meta information with articles web roundups and then we have the title so we're all the way to this point now we need to have some information about the author as well as when it was created so if you ever need a hint you can always in chrome right-click choose inspect element and you can see what the original author did in this case Derrick who works for Envato looks like he used a div with a class of post meta and within it he has an anchor tag and he's simply chaining all of this together and this is something that's fairly common because in this case it's not a list of individual links it's actually a phrase Sidharth on September 23rd with 484 comments so why don't we use a paragraph tag and I'm just going to write it out for now now we need to take a look at a couple things first some of these are links so notice the word on isn't a link but 44 comments is because that's going to link directly to the comments and the author's name is clickable because that will take you to the authors page so if I move back I know that I need to wrap the name and the number of comments with an anchor tags and again this won't link anywhere we just want to set up the appropriate links good now secondly remember in a real world blog this would be generated dynamically but for now you're just learning about mark up so we can hard code all of this in and finally we have the introduction so we can wrap that within ptex it's also common you might see somebody wrap this with in something called text or you might see body that's coming too and that's when you need to target that text specifically and nothing else and I need to make sure that I wrap this within paragraph tags and clean this up there we are so now we have our body and we have our two paragraph tags and then finally we have this continue and so we'll wrap that with an anchor tag and the her F is going to be nothing the value will be continued if you want we can either wrap this within parenthesis like so or you could do it within your CSS as I think that's a stylistic thing maybe we'll have some fun and put it in our CSS though it doesn't really matter all right so notice not once have we looked at our page while developing this markup we don't need to right now we're just creating markup we'll do the design later so now we are finished with it let's go ahead and view what we have in the browser and here we are so you can see this is clean unstyled markup the next step is to make it look like what you see here using CSS so I'm going to open up my stylesheet I want you to note that we are linking to this stylesheet as per usual so the first step is we need to style our wrapper and in this case we don't have a real website so we will use the body as a wrapper and I'm going to set the width to an arbitrary value I could measure this but we don't need to 600 pixels and we'll make sure that the content is centered on the page now I'm going to zoom out a few clicks and reload and now you can see that has been centered now also if you'd like to provide some padding you could maybe set 20 pixels on the top and bottom and auto on the left and right I reload you can see that's taking effect and this is a new syntax so we know we can do margin top and margin bottom of 20 pixels but isn't that redundant well there are also short hands and there's two different forms one you specify margin and then you can go like a clock top right bottom left top right bottom left so if we needed to convert this right here we would say top is 20 right is 0 bottom is 20 as well and left is 0 so now we have successfully converted it but we can even reduce this as well because notice this is fairly common where your top bottom will be one value and the left and right will be a different value so we can reduce this even more so by doing margin top and bottom for the first pram and left and right for the second per am so this is identical to this now there's one more form I don't want to overload you but if you want to do Marcin with three values so if I did 20 pixels five pixels 10 pixels this means 20 pixels for the top five pixels for the right 10 pixels for margin-bottom and because we did not specify left the right value will be substituted so this is the exact same thing as this don't worry if that seems like too much for now you can get away with simply using this form so I'm going to remove all of this and I'll get rid of this one as well and now we have some margin of 20 pixels on the top and the bottom good what's the next step well we know right here that this image is floated to the left so this may present a little bit of confusion for you because yes the image is floated to the left but notice everything below it is blink so how can we do that well first let's simply try floating the image so in this case we don't want to target all images because what that's going to do even though it will work in this instance what that is going to do is find every single image in your website and float it and you certainly don't want that so we can restrict it to only the image within the article element and if you need it to be more specific because remember you can have multiple article elements on your page you could provide that with a class in this case let's keep it generic and I'll say find all images within the article next I'm going to reload the page and now you can see that has been floated to the left but as you can see there's very little room and we need some spacing if we come back you can see there's roughly 20 pixels so you could measure this but again we're mostly just having fun so I'm going to provide some margin right push the text away and now if I reload the page can you see that's been pushed away a little bit if i zoom into full size you can see that looks about right maybe we can adjust it to 25 but notice now this is what I was referring to we float it to the image to the left successfully but then once the text gets below the image the float is no longer effective because the image has completed and the text continues as it would before so what we really need is a way to have a whole block to the left that way anything below the image is blank as you can see right here so let's see what the original creator did I'm going to right click inspect element scroll down a touch and if we hit the magnifying glass I can click on the image and now can you see that he has a div with a class to post image he has an anchor tag because you can click on the link so we need to make sure that we add that to our markup then he has the image itself and then he wraps the entire main content area within a div with a class of preview and now what you can see here is if we scroll back up the post image is floated to the left so that entire block is floated to the left if I were to remove that you can see how that would effect things it would be all the way up there and next if we scroll down the preview is floated to the right and again if I change that you can see how that ends up so now we're starting to understand it and if we need to account for this margin again and you need the specific value for some reason remember it's all available here you click on it and now we can see it's floated to the left and margin right is 30 pixels okay so let's go and update our little project here first margin right is not 25 like we estimated it's 30 and secondly this image needs to be clickable so I'm going to add that in right now and we'll do it right here now if I reload it looks the same but can you see that it's changed to a cursor and when I click on that that would take me to wherever the link was directing to okay good so now let's fix this issue right here I'm going to come back and revise our markup now and we're going to wrap all of our main content area within a div with a class of preview now notice we're not using anything specific here because we only need the div for positioning and that's what a div is for only for positioning it doesn't have any semantic meaning and now at the very end just below the body and just below continue I'm going to close it out and lastly I need to indent everything so we have nice clean indented markup so if I reload the page again remember div has no visuals it's only for formatting again so now we're going to say preview float to the right and now if I reload you can see that it's floating to the right but now it's placed on its own line now why is this and I guarantee this will trip you up at first because you're thinking I'm floating to this to the right but it seems as if it's still taking up all of the available space and it's because a div has a default display of block and what that means is that box is going to take up as much space as it can on the line right there you see that's a huge box that wide box is not small enough to fit up in this area so it's forced onto its own line in order to contain that whole box so watch what happens though if you explicitly state a width and maybe you say 400 pixels reload and notice that's now floated to the right if we remove that you can see we have it like before so now we are definitely floating it to the right but it seems like it's still too small and if I were to make that 350 pixels now it's small enough to fit up here so it jumps up so now at this point we can either return and figure out exactly what the width is or because we're mostly estimating here you can play around with it a little bit if you like or you can be more mathematical and we can say all right well we have 600 pixels worth of space to work with next I know my image is 200 pixels wide all images on that tuts are 200 so we can say 600 minus 200 is 400 pixels but remember we can't do 400 because we also have to factor in any padding and margin that was applied to it in this case we applied 30 pixels worth of padding so 600 minus 200 is 400 minus 30 is 370 which is the exact value that we've applied here so now I'm going to remove the background color of red because we don't need it anymore and it's starting to look a lot better the next step is to set our font here it appears that we're using Helvetica or Arial so we'll set a font family and you've learned this by now of sans-serif which will default to the most appropriate font on your computer which is again likely Helvetica or Arial and now that's updated next let's figure out what the font size is so I'm going to right click inspect element and make sure I am clicking the h1 and we can go to computed styles and if we scroll down here we can see font weight is bold font size is 39 pixels so we'll do that now and we'll say article h2 font size is 39 pixels so a couple of things here is we are limiting this to only in h2 within an article however if you anticipate having lots of h2s and they all should be this font size you should remove the article because you don't want to restate yourself over and over and in this case you would place it maybe at the top for your general styling let's reload the page and now that's that correct size but also it seems like the line height is a little too high and by line height remember we can specify the line height of each line so if I reload you can see that adjusts if I make it a really large number you'll see the difference there so if we set it to 1 m this is another unit of measurement that is the width of the letter M or another way again is to go back inspect element and let's figure out what the computed line height is in this case it's 43 so notice it's just a touch higher than the font size itself and this is fairly common now I'm going to reload and that's looking good to me the next step is to take care of our meta information so let's do that now what we can see here is the anchor tags are green but they're not always green so if we go to the author information this link is gray but in general most links in the body or in the text will be green so we can set that generally and then we can override that whenever we need to and that's the advantage to the Cascade functionality of CSS so I will click the magnifying tool and select an anchor and find out that the color if I go to computed styling is this right here so I can paste that in color there we are and that's looking a lot better now we also know though that this text is italic but that shouldn't be the default so I don't want to place it within my general styling instead I'm going to override it and only place it within the meta tag so right here we can say meta a font-style:italic reload and now that's been made italic next we need to figure out what the font size is so I'm going to click it again and here we can see that the font size is 14 pixels so we'll place that right here because that is going to be specific to this section reload the page that's better and now these need to be displayed in line so if we come back we can see that we are using list items so I can say meta li display:inline and what that's going to do is make it into a horizontal set and it will also get rid of any bullets next we need to provide a little breathing room after each one but also notice if i zoom in can you see that the dividers are backslashes and something you may be tempted to do is right here do something like this and then reload the page and sure enough that seems to work but that's a very bad practice because this is a separator it's styling and it has no purpose within your markup you'll see people do this often when they're creating navigations they'll use the pipe character to separate each one instead we're going to use our CSS and we can use some fun pseudo classes to do this so I will type meta a colon after and now we're going to add content after what content are we adding a backslash and now if we load the page it's going to look a little odd to you and this is a rarity so it's very common that a backslash will refer to an escaping so it's thinking that we're saying this character right here shouldn't be considered the wrapping quotes for this character it's assuming that we are literally referring to a single quote instead of the closing wrapper and that's why you can see below it's changed the syntax highlighting and this is a helpful way that syntax highlighting can point out errors to you so what do we want to do if we want to say no treat this as an actual backslash we're going to escape that as well a little odd but it is a rarity and now you can see that has been added next we need to provide some breathing room because if I close this out again it looks like it has some space right there so why don't we give it some padding and we'll use the shorthand and we don't want any padding on the top or bottom but maybe 10 pixels on the left and right and now if I reload the page there's a little more room there but you know what I think that's too much so I'm going to reduce that down to five and the next step is if i zoom in again notice that it's treating this backslash with the exact same formatting as our anchor tag so what if we instead apply this content after the list item itself rather than the anchor tag reload and now that's receiving the formatting of the list item and not the anchor tag again though I think that is too much spacing and also it's the wrong color let's figure out what the right color is inspect element and notice here that the original creator is using a span tag that's okay too there's lots of ways to skin a cat remember and we're going to get the color which is nine nine nine so we're going to take this right here and say color nine nine nine and also I'm going to reduce the padding to two pixels on the left and right reload and that's looking a lot better the last thing I see now is notice that there is no backslash after the final item right here but there is four R's right here we need to get rid of that so how can we specify that the very last list item should not have anything we can say meta get all list items but then we're going to reduce that to a subset and now we're only selecting the last child so that will only get in this case the very last list item whether that's this one or if we added another one last child would then select this one now we need to say after and we're going to say content is nothing so I'm going to set it to that or we could also say content none reload and now you can see that's disappeared good so this is an excellent example of how we're using CSS to create the dividers that way you don't have to return to your markup if you need to change the layout if you want to make it a pie simply change it and that's going to be updated everywhere next is you see this extra spacing we have and you should know this by now you LS will add some extra padding remember here padding starts let's make sure that we zero that out and we'll place it right here meta padding left zero reload and now that's been reduced and finally we need to get rid of some of the default margin top that is applied to all h2 tags if I go to computed margin-top default of 32 so this is something you might be noticing now is it sure does seem that we are having to override the browser defaults quite a bit wouldn't it be great if we could start with a blank slate well we can by using a reset stylesheet and I'm going to teach you about that in a future lesson for now we're going to come back and say article h2 we don't want it to apply to all h2s only the article h2 so we will apply it right here article h2 reload and that's been pushed up so we're almost done just a little bit more the next step is you see if we zoom out this is wrapped within a little box so let's do that ourselves I will come back and you'll see that we have added this information right here within a P tag you could also use a div there's lots of options I'm going to add a class of post info now again you might be thinking why are we doing class and not ID and it's because if we did ID remember in a blog this would be repeated over and over this exact markup would be repeated for as many postings as you have on your website and in that case every posting would receive an ID of post info and you can't do that if you want to group them you use a class now we can target it at the bottom and we'll say post info and now we'll apply the background color and the base color so we know the base color is 999 why don't we figure out what the background color is inspect elements and we're going to get this whole div right here and we can see the background is f3 so now reload and you can see we do have that but there should be a little bit of breathing room all around it so we'll do some padding 2 pixels worth reload and that looks good to me if you want to add a little bit more you can next we can see that we're still using the green text but that's not being applied right here they're using the exact same color all throughout so let's update this to post info a and we have a couple options here now so one I could say color should also be 999 and if I reload you'll see that takes effect because of the Cascade nature so right up here we have a is one color but now down here because we have applied post info this will override it now in this case if we also did it here we would override anything above because that's the way CSS works the lower it is on the age the more likely it is to take presidents so let's see what would happen if we did post info at the top and then anchor at the bottom which one will take presidents Green will now why is that and that's because this is taking effect even though this is lower on the page because there is more weight what we call weight without getting into it too much every element whether it's an ID or a class or a tag name receives a specific amount of weight and that's how we use the Cascade nature so you can say all anchor tags should be this color but then if you override that you can say all anchor tags within post info well that's a little more weight or being more specific so this is going to take precedence so now that's looking better the last step here is there should be an underline either so we're going to remove that by doing text decoration at the very bottom of none reload and now that's looking good what about when we hover over it though can you see when you hover over it changes to a different color that's easy post info a:hover and in that case we'll make the color and we'll just assume it's black and now if I hover over it now that's changed to black also the font size is likely going to be the same font size as we have up here so we can check that and see 14 pixels and also if we come back we can see that it's also italic so it seems that the exact same values we have here will apply to the post info and I'm going to make sure that I preface that with a period so it's treated as a class and now that's receiving those values as well next let's see what is happening here where we have all of this extra space and that's because again this is set to a display of block so it's going to take up all of the space available if we want to override that one way and we call this shrink wrapping is you float it to the left and that will make sure that it only contains exactly as much as what's contained within the element reload and now you can see that's taken effect but now because we have floated it we've sort of taken it out of the flow the document and now this is popping up which is odd but we can fix that easily by getting the body and making sure it clears anything that's above it so get the body which is what we have right here and sure that we clear any floats that are above it reload and now that's been pushed down and now can you see that we shrink trap this so now the text as soon as that cuts off so does the wrapper now we need to get rid of the spacing right here and that's applied to this h2 from the browser by default again so we can look for article h2 and now set the margin bottom to zero or if we want we can override it and say margin top left bottom right is zero and now that's been pushed up so now we're getting very very close just a little bit more here we're going to focus on specifics now notice how this meta information here lines up perfectly with the top of the image but that's not the case in our situation so let's figure it out inspect element and now we will click on preview and click on the UL and can you see this will wrap a little box right around it you'll see right here a big box and now you can see there's some of that spacing above and what's happening is it's applying default margin top to the UL so let's get rid of that margin top to zero if you want to see that take effect immediately in the browser you can use element style here to reduce that like so and now that's lining up nicely and the same thing here it's applying 1m after so let's see margin bottom if we set that to zero that's going to push that up as well and that's more like what you see right here so we will do that as well March on top why don't we set margin to zero all around reload and you know what that might be a little bit too much let's come back yeah there's a little bit of space so I'm going to say margin top is zero right is zero but bottom is going to be let's say 10 pixels worth I could measure but I think that's close enough maybe reduce that down to 8 good so that's lining up our heading is looking fine it looks like this distance between each letter though is a little bit reduced compared to mine so we can use letter spacing and if that's going to apply to all h2s I need to place it up here letter spacing and why don't we set it to negative 1 pixel this is fairly common and that just gives it a little bit more tightness so that's looking really good the final two things we're going to do is float this we're going to change the text color and also notice here because we applied a font size to the anchor but not the post info text itself that's getting a different height so I'm going to go right here to post info and explicitly say that the font size should be 14 pixels there we go that's looking a lot better and now let's get the color of the text and I'm thinking that's the same color as what we have right here but let's make sure just in case and we have P go to computed styling color it is a little bit different 57 57 so we will go to body color 57 57 reload and that's been changed and the font size is going to be a little bit different as well let's grab that and come back font size that is 14 pixels too so notice if we go right here man that seems like word is stating 14 pixels quite a bit so maybe you should consider targeting all paragraphs at the top generally so we could say P font size is 14 and that's going to be the base font size for all paragraphs so then I can remove this if I reload we're still getting that same effect next we're going to adjust the line height because it's a little bit higher here so inspect element and computed size line height is 21 pixels so we're going to set that as the default as well line height 21 pixels reload okay that's looking a lot better now continue what we have right here that should have been floated to the right and we have it and notice there's no way to Target it so why don't we apply a clasp continue now you might be thinking what I thought that was a bad practice to name a class the same as the value but it's not it's just convenient you can change this to read more and this will still make sense it refers to the element that will continue on to the post and now within the article well place it right around here and you'll see how quickly it becomes important to organize your code efficiently now it's also common instead of doing continue to use a class name of more that's fairly common as well float it to the right and then also note if I cancel all this out that continue here is an anchor tag and it's wrapped within parentheses so let's style that accordingly I will come back and let's look at what we have right here right there the font size is too high so we'll adjust that and again it probably makes sense to abstract this 14 pixels out so we're not restating it so often why don't we do that now I'm going to remove that and right here we will also state that the font size is 14 or you could bring it down here as well and next let's go ahead and add the parentheses on and we can use our helpful before and after pseudo-classes to do that continue and notice here we're using some extra weight to target only the continued element that is within article or the continued class in this case I don't think we need to be that specific don't be more specific than you need to be next we're going to say continue after and we're going to add content a closing parenthesis and then continue before and we're going to add an opening parenthesis there you go and it's that easy believe it or not let's see what happens when we hover over anchor tags by default and see it does change color and we will just change that to black so we'll set that by default when you hover over an anchor tag set the color to black let's reload ours and now when I hover over this you can see the black color take effect and because we did the same thing within post info we can go ahead and remove that from our stylesheet so right here let's get rid of that because we already are stating that okay so good that's going to finish it up for today there are some more tweaks we could make but you can see with just a little bit of effort and checking you can recreate what you see on the web really quite easily by one trying to create your own markup and don't always do exactly what the developer of the webpage did maybe you can do it better maybe you can you can always refer to it for advice and then using developer tools in chrome you can right-click and choose inspect element in Firefox you can download an extension called Firebug which provides much of the same functionality in fact it's sort of the original when it comes to inspecting webpages so good job and that's going to finish it up for today
