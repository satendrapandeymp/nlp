okay now we will look into data set attributes and I hope you know the basics of attribute for example you have any HTML element this is Steve okay so in terms of HTML markup I am NOT talking about JavaScript object in terms of HTML markup this is collection of different attributes okay so attributes can be class type ID and so on style so this is just collection of attributes and sometime it's it's useful to attach some information to this particular element okay for example when the element was created what was the date who created this element or some kind of ID or anything you want to store on this marker so first solution you may think that every element every javascript element is object right this is object HTML let's say this is button element okay so this element is normal JavaScript object nothing is special okay so you can add any property let's say I want to store one data X so you can define property X you can property define property Y and C okay on this JavaScript object equivalent javascript object that you are seeing in HTML markup define some property then you stored it and you retrieve it using that object like this is object is AE dot X Y and C this sort of thing okay but this is not good okay why this is not good because you are extending your native objects right you are extending your element object that is not a good idea okay it's okay if you mind the name of your property so that you don't deal with any conflict now come to this solution okay that HTML provides the solution is if we define any attribute like data X okay if you define any attribute like this data X like that Y is some string okay so this is valid markup and this doesn't violate any principle of your HTML markup so this is valid and when you define this kind of data in this kind of attribute in your markup the equivalent object okay if this is your object II okay okay some tag here and you define this attribute here later or x and y so internally it creates some property X here and Y here inside when special object that is referred by data set property on this element E so you can access this data X by Y dot data set dot X Y dot data set dot y okay it might be confusing for you so let's see one example this is my excuse me this is my simple markup and inside body I have one div then anchor then button okay we will focus on this element right now this has three attributes class name and type and I want to store some data on this element for example the date when this button was add any in this page we can write like this data date okay this is okay date at eight and zero four zero four two zero one three okay and let's add one more data and the Tefo created this one I created so my name here okay now this is valid markup and we associated two data with particular element okay this button element internally we how can we can we access this let's see this is my page nothing special one anchor and one button okay now let's grab that button element how to do that there are several ways either you can identify this div one using document or get element by ID then see the last child or you can use select all button or query selector I am going to use doc MnDOT query selector okay let's open here okay define one variable let's say B and document dot invoke this query selector I am interested in just one ill main and there is just one element in my markup button okay so what his PB is just this button element or if you look let's say in terms of class also come on I will chain my keyboard sometime it's stuck okay so now this B has HTML button element and now I am trying to I'm trying to see the class of this element okay object George it's not working excuse me come on okay I think now it's working object dot prototype dot to his string to a string dot call and this be okay so this is now HTML button element and you can access all the properties like Bill taught class named B dot name but how to access this one okay the simplest solution is bill dot data say this is this property is defined on this HTML element and we are accessing that using dot notation so B dot data set is another object okay and how to access that data beetalk data set dot date this is the date that we are interested or to his store on this element okay be taught data is it not we can oops no div it's very slow I don't know George dev this is praveen okay so let me recap once again you can store any data using this kind of attribute that is called data set attribute data - some name that you want to store data - again there is no limit limitation on number of limitation in the store as much as data as possible and how to access that just grab - that element and there is one property that is called data set so just access that property that is a come that is a complete object in which the properties are defined which is which is just equivalent of the second part of this after this test that date and if so you axis like this element dot data set dot the name of your data built or data set taught live like this if you have any confusion any questions please comment below this video and thanks for watching bye
