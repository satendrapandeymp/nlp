ah yo people I am Sean from the net ninja and this is lesson 9 in HTML basics the image tag so surprise surprise the image tag is what we use to show images to the user and we do this by specifying within the tag where the image is stored using the source attribute now if you remember from previous tutorials I said that all tags can have these things called attributes and attributes are just a way of specifying additional information to the tag about that time so in this case is the source attribute and within the source attribute we're going to say where the image is being stored the path to the image so we're going to jump back into brackets now and we're going to pop an image in our web page right here I am exactly where we left off last time and I think what I want to do is pop a really big banner at the top of the webpage just to catch some attention but before I do that I'm going to quickly explain how I've stored my image so if you look in the left hand kind of navigation bit here we've got this image folder and I've created this folder by right-clicking and going to new folder and then you can see you can type in your folder name app or image too and then what you want to do is find your image wherever it stored whether it's on your computer or whether it's online from a website you want to save it into this folder once you've done that we're ready to crack on I'm going to delete this image to folder because I've already done it here and you can see within this folder I've named my image fish - banner jpg and I got this from a website called free images calm and free images calm is a pretty cool website for just kind of developing websites locally on your machine and testing and whatnot so you can go here I've searched for fish and I found this one which I really think kinda captures everything that mr. mr. greens smelly fish Emporium is all about so I'm going to use this image you can use whichever image you want to do once you've got that save it into the folder and I'll see you back inside brackets okay so once you've saved your image we're going to add it into our HTML document so the first thing we want to do is add the tag and the attribute the sauce we're going to specify where it's being stored and this attribute is going to be relative to this HTML document so our image is being stored in this folder here so what we want to do is type in the folder name first of all and you can see that brackets is giving me kind of a tip as to where it thinks the image is going to be stored itself and it's suggesting we put this forward slash here because that means we're going to say to the document look we're going inside this folder inside the image folder I want to put the forward slash it's found this image called fish - banner so I can just double click this everyone I'll just single click it rather and it's going to pop that in for me and show me a little thumbnail which is really cool just to make sure I've got the right one so we've put our we've put the path to our image in and we're going to save this out now and see what it looks like in the browser ok there it is and it's pretty big and one thing I don't like about this is that we're having to scroll all the way to the right to see the full image now I don't want it to go off the page I want it to be just as wide as as the browser is so we can do this by specifying some width and height attributes to the image in the image tag so we'll jump back into brackets and we'll say a width attribute equals 100% and this is going to say to the browser look whatever size you are make this image 100% width of that browser and we can specify a height if we want but I'm going to leave this blank you do it like this I'm going to leave it blank in fact I'm not going to have it at all because all I care about is specifying the width of the image I want it to be 100% and then it will work out high automatically dependent on the weight so I'm going to save this and again we're going to view this in the browser oops not that show me the there we go that's why there we go so now you can see we don't have the scrollbar at the top it's just taking the image and it's just as wide as the browser is now you can do this you can add the width attribute to the HTML tag however I prefer to do it all in the CSS we're separating the visual aspects then to the structural aspects I see the HTML as being the structure of everything and the CSS as being the kind of design visual aspects of everything so personally I'd recommend specifying the width of the image as 100% in the CSS but you can do it this way this entirely your call so seeing that much I'm going to take off the width attribute there is one more attribute in the image tag that I think is worth mentioning and that is the alt attribute and what this is is a way it provided some alternative text instead of the image so if you've got a screen reader or a website crawler coming out to your website and they don't see images but they will read the alt text so we just give the image in some kind of short description and I'm just going to say mr. greens fish Emporium so a screen reader wouldn't see the banner they'd see this little bit of text here and we'd save that out and it's not going to have any effect visually so I'm not going to jump into a browser this is just so you can kind of get into the habit of putting alt text in the the tag just for kind of accessibility issues okay so that's all there is to the image tag in the next tutorial what we're going to do is cover links and we're going to make like a nice little navigation system for the website I'll see you guys then you
