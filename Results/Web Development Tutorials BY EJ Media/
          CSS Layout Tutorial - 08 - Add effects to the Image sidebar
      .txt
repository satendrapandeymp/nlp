welcome to the eighth video on CSS layouts in this video we're going to add some effects to the image sidebar that we did in the last video so let's go ahead and open up our web page now a lot of websites are doing these little tricks when you mouse over a particular element and they'll add an effect to let you know that something's changed since you've moused over this and also it adds a lot of pizzazz to your webpages so let's go ahead and set that up so we'll close out of our web page now we don't have to touch our HTML in this video we've already set up our element so we don't need to touch the HTML in this video we're simply dealing with our style sheet so and so first let's add a property here to the image sidebar rule set and we'll add this right at the end and I'll just copy and paste in here and it is the opacity property and we're going to set that to 1.0 the values are between 0 and 1.0 now let's go ahead and save this and we'll open up our web page again and you're not going to see any change here because 1.0 just represents what the image looks like and so the values are between 0 and 1 now if you made it 0 the image would go completely white and obviously we don't want that so this is the first state if you'll remember in the last CSS series we talked about States so this is the first state now we need to add a rule set for the mouse over and we use of course over and so let's go ahead and do that and we can just put this right below our image sidebar roll set and I just copy and paste this in here now what we're doing here is of course we need our class and then we need to add over to it and this is the mouse over rule now make sure there's no space between this semicolon and this H otherwise it will not work so may just make sure you don't put a space there now what we're doing here is we're going to set this value for the property to 0.4 and this will add whiteness to our image and so the state will change so we're going to go from this state right here to this state when we mouse over when we mouse over our image sidebar so let's go ahead and save this let's reopen our web page and there you can see we've got that cool effect now so now the user will know when his mouse is over this element now that's a little bit fast now some people like that they like that fast transition other web designers want to slow that down and I will show you how to slow that down right now so let's go back to our stylesheet and we're going to add another property and rule and we're going to put that right below the opacity property and it is the transition property okay and what we're saying here with this transition property is that the transition from 1 to 0.4 should take one second and so it won't be an instant flip so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and open this up and there you can see we've got this nice transition is not as abrupt now you may want to speed that up a little bit so we could put a half a second in here and actually I prefer half a second so let's go ahead and open up our web page and you can see it's a little bit quicker now so that's it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
