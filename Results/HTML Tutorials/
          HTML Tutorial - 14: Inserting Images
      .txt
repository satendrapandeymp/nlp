hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 14th tutorial in this course in this tutorial we'll be seeing how we can insert images in our webpages now to insert an image in a web page you have to use the IMG tag in HTML now before I show you guys you know the output of this HTML document that I have here opened in my text editor and before I explain the text in it I'm going to show you the image that I will be inserting in the web page that I'll be making so this is the image no tennis racket with a few tennis balls and you know let's say we're making a tennis website and we want to text the Tennis Center to be at the center of the website with a foreign size of 7 so you have that font size we have to use the foreign tag and we've checked out the font ID in the last year old and since we want this at the center of the page we are also using the center tag here so let's check out the sequence of tags now on line number 7 so I have the center tag first and then I have the font or tied to set the size of the text to 7 and then I finally have the paragraph tag to you know have the text so I'll be closing the tags in the reverse order so I'll first close the paragraph or text and I'll have to do that here I haven't actually closed the paragraph text so I'll type in - or so a /b here and then I'll be closing the font tag and then finally I'll close the center tag right and then on line number 9 I have the IMG tag right so between the less than symbol and the greater than symbol I have the text IMG which is a short form for image and then you have to you know give a value to the source attribute or the SRC attribute of the image tag so you type in SRC which is the name of the attribute and then you put in the equal to symbol and then within double quotes you you know type in the name of the file and if the file is in the same directory as the HTML document as is the case in you know you know for me in this tutorial I have the you know image tennis dot jpg the one that I just showed you in the same in the same folder as I have the you know this document which is you know folder on my desktop then you do not have to mention the entire path of the file but let's say I had this in the Documents folder and the music folder of my system in that case I would have had to type in the entire path of this file right and I hope you understand what I mean by that and then I have also set a value for the height attribute of this of this of this image file I have you know set the height to 80% of the original height and I've also set the width of the image to 100% of the original width and these two attributes are actually not required like they're not necessary you don't have to give them values like if I will not include the height attribute here then nobody for 100% of the height would be included in the webpage right but since I want 80% of it to be included I would have to keep it here and then to close it you don't have to close it in the traditional way of /img you could just type in a slash at the end and then just have in the closing angular bracket right I'll save this file and I'll open it in my web browser I'll refresh it so this is how it looks we have the text the tennis center at the center as we expect it and then we have this image right so this is how easy it is to insert images in web pages in HTML you just have to use the IMG tag and you know that's it for now in the next tutorial we'll be checking out more tags and more features so you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already and assume the next video till then take care
