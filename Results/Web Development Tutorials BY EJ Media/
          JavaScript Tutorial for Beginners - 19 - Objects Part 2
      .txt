we are picking up right where we left off in the last video with JavaScript objects and you will remember we talked about properties and how we can use those to describe our particular object which in this case is our orc so we came up with a color green we came up with the orcs height which is at 5 feet and we came up with its weight which is 180 pounds and of course these are variables but you will remember we call them properties once we put these inside our object so that is part one of the equation the other part involves actions giving our object actions because in real life a lot of objects perform actions so our orc could run he could eat he could sleep he could swim he could yell and so we use functions to create actions for our object and in this case you can see right here I created a function for yelling and it's sort of similar to properties you'll see here that we specify the name we use a colon then we use the function keyword and then it's just like a normal function we use the parentheses and then we use the squiggly brackets and in between the squiggly brackets we put in some statements to execute and in this case we're going to do a document that write and the orc will yell out works are the best now similar to variables and properties functions are a little bit different inside the object as well as you can see over here in this standalone function we specify the function keyword first well over here its second and you can see here we have the name well we specify that first in the object so you can see it's a little bit different in the way variables and properties are so again we almost flip these once we get into the object now similar to the way variables are renamed once they get inside the object functions also have a different name we call them methods so it's actually not called a function even though it is a function now I don't know why they decided to do that but anyways they are called methods once you place a function inside the object now if you want to continue calling them functions that's fine I kind of think of them as functions anyways but the real technical lingo is to call them methods now you will remember in the last video when we want to access something in our object we have to specify the object name then dot and then the property in this case color we use the same exact syntax to access functions so once again we need to have the object name first then we use dot and then we just specify the method which in this case is our yelp method and then this will get executed and the orc would yell out orcs are the best now we'll be able to tie something together right now now this document that write will make more sense the document is an object yes we are accessing the document and there's the dot we've talked about and we are accessing the right method so this should now all make sense what this document dot write is and we'll be doing a lot more with the document object but this too is an object and we can access its properties and methods just like any other object so that should make more sense now okay that is going to do it for this video now in the next video we'll code our first object
