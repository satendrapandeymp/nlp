hey guys what's up in this video I'm going to be demonstrating how to enable custom fonts on your websites so if you have designed a web design or a website design and you have custom fonts this is going to be how you implement them and it should work across all modern browsers so you shouldn't have any worries about that so what we're going to want to do is first year and I want to download the custom font that you want to use and you're going to make sure that it is a TTFN font or OTF font or pretty much a true type font so um once you've done that grab that font and put it in a folder I've created a folder called custom fonts tutorial essentially you're going to want to create something similar then I have also created a style folder and inside that style folder is a style dot CSS style sheet and it's blank for now so we'll work with that later on and also let's go ahead and create a fonts folder and throw your custom font in an air ok so next we will open up the index.html file that I have created it's very simple obviously we have a title we have a character set and we have the link to this blank style sheet so oh and also in the body we have h1 tag that says this is a boring old thought obviously that is debatable some may argue that this is not boring or old I believe it is so that's what we're going to go with now we're going to go ahead and open up that blank style sheet so you guys are going to want to create one very simple to do and open up the blank style sheet and we're going to want to single out our h1 tag and say that we want to Center it first of all it's going to look like that obviously you guys don't have to Center it I'm just doing it for the sake of the tutorial and make it nice and neat and now that it's centered we are going to declare our font type so we're going to say font face so we use the @ sign over say font face and then the brackets essentially it yep it's normal syntax for a CSS declaration so now we're going to declare the font family and you can name this whatever you want you can name it I don't even know like coolest aunt in the world this way I'm just kidding so then you do that and what we'll just we'll just go with that so that's going to be the name of our font and we're going to have a link to that font so we have the source and then we're going to normally as any CSS URL or link you dooper you would type out URL and then parentheses and then either single quotes or double quotes it doesn't matter dot dot dot and since our font is in the fonts folder we're going to write /font and the name of our font which is brush script ETF so I'm going to go ahead and copy that throw it right here and then we are going to say the format of the font is true type so that that's because it is a true type font so that's pretty much that essentially we have now declared the font and we are ready to implement it into the h1 tag so what we're going to say is font and also a good a good thing to know is you should always have fallbacks on your fonts so what we have here is let me erase this and we'll say 18 pixels and essentially what these fallbacks are is if for whatever reason the browser cannot load the custom font these will be the fonts that will fall back to so in this case if the bread if the user doesn't have Helvetica new it will fall back to Arial then Helvetica etc etc so what we're going to do is replace Helvetica new with our font name which is coolest aunt in the world and there it is you can see that the custom font has been working what has been enabled so essentially we can go ahead and make this 40 pixels and you can see it's bigger and also if you want for obvious reasons you can change the name to brush script and obviously now it doesn't work because it thinks the font that we were calling to is called coolest phone in the world so we have to now change that to brush script oops brush script and now you can see that the font is looking always working perfectly so this is I mean there are arguably better ways to implement this I personally believe that this is going to be the most well it is becoming quickly the most common way to implement a font so if you guys want to use custom fonts on your site font faces definitely the best and easiest way to implement it again that's very much debatable depending on who you are so don't hate don't like bash me for that I love using font face I think it's the best way so take it with whatever I mean I just taught you how to do it so enjoy I mean now you guys can obviously now you guys know how to use custom fonts with font face and enjoy making your websites so that's it for this video guys and I'll see you later any questions comment below subscribe etc if you have any desire tutorials on either Photoshop Illustrator web like HTML javascript jquery obviously which is javascript but already ajax anything you guys need assistance with and want some help with i will be more than happy to help CSS if there's some things that you would like made clear or stuff like that HTML yada-yada-yada hopefully PHP but I'm not the best at PHP soon maybe are you guys later
