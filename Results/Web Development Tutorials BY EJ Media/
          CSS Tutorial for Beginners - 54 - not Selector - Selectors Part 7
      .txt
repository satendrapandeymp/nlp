in this video we're going to go over the knot selector that they added in css3 and I find this a very very useful selector because you can make math changes to a lot of different elements and you can exclude particular elements that you don't want to have affected by that change so again it's very very useful so we're going to do a working example in this video now you can see here I've added an h2 and h3 and then again the paragraphs so we've got three different types of elements here in h2 element and h3 element and a paragraph element now the paragraphs let's go ahead and change the color of that so we'll just go ahead and use the type selector P and let's go ahead and just change the color of the text to red and let's just go ahead and make sure that went down okay let's go ahead and refresh our page and it did now what we want to do here is change all of the rest of the elements in our page to a different color specifically we want to change all the h2 and the h3 elements and let's just say we want to change the color to dark green but we don't want to have our paragraphs affected by that change we want the color of this to remain red and that is where the not selector comes into play now the not selector is a pseudo selector so you will remember we need a colon for that and then we just use the keyword not now here is where the parentheses go and here is where we put in the selector now notice I said selector not element so we pick a selector from our style sheet that we want to exclude and in this case it's going to be the P selector so let's go ahead and put in P there and then of course we need a curly brace and as I said let's just go ahead and change the color to dark green and we're good to go so let's go ahead and refresh our page and there you can see it worked the h2 the h3 elements all change to dark green but our exclusion worked all of our paragraphs were not affected and again you can see how useful this is we didn't actually even have to create CSS rules for our h2 and h3 it just made a mass change and allowed us to exclude all of our paragraphs now remember I said this is a selector that we have to use from our stylesheet if I get rid of this rule watch what happens I want you to pay attention to this so let's go ahead and save this and look everything switched to green why is that because when the browser read in this stylesheet it didn't find the paragraph selector so there was really nothing to exclude here so it just went ahead and changed all the elements that contained text on our web page to dark green so that can be somewhat confusing so just remember you have to have a selector in here for this to actually work so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this back in let's refresh our page and everything's back to normal so that's how the knot selector works I think it's a very very useful selector and I will see you guys in the next video thank you
