how's it going I want to come back to a next episode and how to create HTML and CSS now in this lesson you're gonna learn about something called transition inside CSS and this is something that is really useful when you want to create any sort of smooth transitioning inside a website for example if I were to take an example from the previous episode where we talked about the harbor effect we can add which is a pseudo class to one of the elements that allow for us to change an element when we hover the mouse cursor on top of the elements now if I were to not use transition inside the website and I'm just gonna go and show an example here where I have a tip box that has a background image inside of it if I want to change the image inside this specific dip box smoothly then right now because I only applied the hover effect or the hover pseudo-class it is going to instantly change it instead of smoothly doing it so what we can do using transition is that we can smoothly transition into the new image or in this case down here smoothly transition into something else regarding a dip box or a text element or one the transition basically works on everything the same goes for the hover effects we can use it on you know text images videos and the sort elements we have inside the website so what I want to do is I want to go inside my document and see what exactly I have I had two examples I want to show the first one is going to be with the background image I want to change it smoothly into something else and then afterwards I want to show you that it's not just images what we can do with all sorts of things inside the website so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go inside my stylesheet and what I have here is the styling for my tip box that has the background image so right now we just have a width a height that is both set to 500 pixels then I have the background image I have the background size and then I told it not to repeat the image over and over again so what I want to do is when I hover on top of this dip box using the pseudo class called hover then I want to change into this background image down here which is the harbor version of the image and again just to show inside my root folder I do have two images inside my image folder so this is the one I show first of all when I hover I want to change to this image over here so what I can do is I can go ahead and go inside my main styling of this element not the hubba styling but the main styling up here and I can go to add a transition effect to it now when we want to add a transition to our elements we can actually change different properties of the transition so we could for example say first of all what kind of property do we want to change inside the transition so if I want to change the height or the width or what the background image or the color or something else inside this specific element then we can actually define that inside this first property that we can create for the transition so we can say transition - property and then like I said we can set it to something like the height or the width or something like that now I'm just gonna go insert it - all because I want all the effects inside the hub estate down here to have a slow transition to it now underneath here we can also go ahead and define something like the duration how long should it take for the transition to start to finish so I could say transition - duration and I can set it to something like two seconds if I just wanted to be really slow so I'm gonna say 2's and there we go we can also add something like it Simon function to it meaning that if it were to transition over a duration of two seconds they wanted to just evenly change the whole time I don't want it to slowly start up and then speed up and then slow down again as we finish the transition so this is how we can you know decide the way we want to transition it so what I can say is I want to say transition - timing - function and then I can set it to something like ease or ease in ease in out which is to be slowly ease into transition or also slowly ease out if you want to so there's different stage say we can choose from so I'm just gonna say ease in and out and the last property we can go ahead and add here is something called the delay so if I want to when my mouse cursor goes on top of the image change it then I can say well this should only change after about four seconds so we can say transition - delay for seconds so what I've done now is if we were to go inside my website here and refresh it as you can see it's still instantly tainting if it were to refresh go with my mouse cursor on top of it you can see wait four seconds and then it's gonna slowly transition into the next image so this is how we can do transition now even though the transition is in fact working inside the browser there's a couple of things we need to consider which is that there will be some browsers or some older versions of browsers that don't fully support the transition effect unless we do something else inside the stylesheet here so right now we have these four different stylings I'm just gonna go and copy them because if I want support for other browsers or older versions of the browsers we will need to add a prefix in front of the the stylings in order for these to work in those as well now a preface is not something we talked about before but I'm just gonna go and show how we can do it and then in a later episode I will get more into these prefixes so you understand exactly what they do inside CSS so right now we can see I made a copy of the transition styling and I'm gonna go to go in front of the turn system styling and add the prefix in front of it so right now if I want support for all the versions of Chrome I'll have to say - WebKit - and this is what we call a prefix and I do need to copy-paste this in front of all of them in order to get this working now this is just Chrome so if we want to also have support for Firefox or older versions of it I'm gonna have to change it into mocks instead with a set which stands for Mozilla Firefox I think I'm gonna go ahead and paste it in and if I also want support for opera which is another browser then I'm also gonna have to do that for that one as well so I'm just gonna add an O in between the dashes here so now you might be thinking this is a lot of styling just to get transition working and you're absolutely right and there's an easier way for us to do this instead of having to create all this code here which is just insanely much code to write just to get this one thing working so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and just delete what we have here all the way up so we don't have any more transition going on inside the styling and instead we're going to write everything in one line so essentially when we're done and we have stylings for support for the different browsers we're just gonna have four lines of code just about so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna write transition and I'm not gonna write - anything I'm just gonna say transition then in front of it I'm gonna say : semicolon and then in-between here at first I will need to decide well what is the property I want to change in this case I want to change everything so I'm gonna say all space how long do you want it to take two seconds space what kind of timing function do you want to use well I want to ease in in this case without the doubt just to give another example if I can actually spell it correctly there we go and do we want to have a delay so we can say 1 seconds we could also just leave out the delay if you wanted to but in this case just to have it I'm just gonna write one second so after we've done this we can actually go ahead and copy it paste underneath three more times so it's going to be four lines of code not five and I'm gonna go and add the WebKit to it you're gonna actually write that correctly there we go copy it paste and paste mocks and opera so now if it were to just go ahead and save it go inside the browser it's going to do the exact same thing we still have the transition going on and everything is working and we have support for all the different browsers in here so writing it in four lines of code is much better than having that huge block of code that we just wrote or styling they were just wrote which is much better I think so what I want to do is I want to show you a nother example because below here I have example two and again like I mention in the beginning it's not only images you can change using transition you can use any sort of styling and transition it such as the precision or padding's or Heights or anything like that so in this example I went and created a box which is actually a link and the link allowed for me to go to the front page if it were to click it now as you can see Harbor net is going to slowly open out and then show me a small downward arrow which in this case is just a V because I was lazy but as you can see if I were to remove the hover effects or the transition effect not the hover effect just gonna comment it out then we get something a little bit different and as you can see just pops out and shows the D dropped and arrow now I like to add transitions to my elements inside a website because it just looks a lot better it adds a little bit more of style to a website to have these sort of transitions going on so in this example here just went ahead and said that well when I hover on top of my element here it's just going to extend the box with the text inside of it with a couple of pixels and that way it would get this cool hover effect going on here if we were to go in here and say I don't just want the width to change to show the little V then I can also if I wanted to say I want to change the height to something else so we can say 300 pixels and this actually go ahead and change the transition as you can see I chose to do 100 milliseconds so instead I'm just going to change it to 500 milliseconds there we go if I were to go in and refresh again you can see that we also get different heights and there's slowly transitions into it so you can do a bunch of things when it comes to these different transitions here it's just gonna play around with it a little bit padding left is going to be 500 pixels change the background color to red or even give it a background image if you wanted to so we can do a bunch of cool effects here and we can display text and we can do all sorts of things using only CSS without using JavaScript because in the old days before css3 we had to use JavaScript you want to do these sort of things and we don't have to do that anymore so this is how we can use transition inside CSS I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you next time [Music]
