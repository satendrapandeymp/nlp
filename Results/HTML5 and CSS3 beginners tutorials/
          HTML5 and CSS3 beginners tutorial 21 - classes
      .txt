hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 21 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about classes in HTML and CSS obviously and what a class is is basically just like a styling selector so you are able to add a class to one of your elements and you can style your element according to the class rather than the actual element name and I'm going to show you just where there comes in handy now because let's say I had three paragraphs in my body so let's go ahead and make one paragraph and this paragraph can say I am blue and then we'll make another paragraph and this one can be a different color so let's say that this paragraph must say I wish I were red and one last one just for good measure and we'll say I'm feeling bright yellow bright and yellow okay cool so we'll try and make this one blue we'll try and make this paragraph red and we'll try and make this paragraph yellow now you know from previous tutorials that I can go ahead and select a paragraph tag by its actual element name so I could go ahead and just type in P over here and then style my paragraph like this but the problem with this is that it's going to style all paragraphs the same color as whatever I put in here so if I go ahead and I maybe change this color to blue then it's going to change all of my paragraphs to blue so if I go ahead and run this in Firefox now I have all blue paragraphs so how do I tell Firefox so how do I tell the browser that I only want this paragraph to be blue this one I want to be red and this one I want to be yellow and the answer to that is to pretty much use a class okay so let's go back to HTML over here and I'm going to go ahead and say class is equal to something so we'll set this class equal to blue and basically now we'll be able to select anything with the class of blue and turn that blue and then we'll go ahead and give this one a class as well and we'll set that equal to a class of red and the next one we can set class equal to yellow and my phone just went off like five times during this tutorial so I have no idea what you're on about let's take a look now it's a guy from another YouTube channel just messaging me okay that's cool I'll reply to him later because you guys are more important to me then he is you know I love you guys anyways so we've got the first paragraph with a class of blue the second with the class of red and the third with the class of yellow so let's go over to CSS and instead of styling all of our paragraphs by element name we're going to use the class and to style an element or to style something using a class you're going to go ahead and first put in a period or a full-stop whatever you want to call it and that basically means okay HTML or CSS listen up I'm going to use a cloth then you're going to put in your class name so for our first paragraph we named our class blue so I'm going to go ahead and just copy that and paste that in here and whenever you style something as a class in CSS using notepad plus plus and notepad plus plus always changes the class by default so we can go ahead and or it turns the actual text of the glass red not the class rate but yeah okay so now we can go ahead and style our blue class to have a color of blue and I'm going to save this now and when I go back to Firefox and click refresh you can see that only the blue class is blue and the other two haven't changed yet because we haven't styled them yet okay but that's how you would use a class to style only one element or you could actually style many elements using the same class but yeah let's go ahead now and add in our red glass so remember a period symbol or . and then we'll go ahead and say red and we'll set this color to red and we'll make another class over here called yellow was it actually yellow then i call it yellow I did okay yellow and I'll set this equal to color of yellow yellow you there mm-hmm just kidding okay cool click refresh and I guess the yellow was maybe a bad choice because you can't really see it on the white background but hey okay so we've got one blue paragraph one red paragraph and one yellow paragraph okay so that's how you would use a class to style one element at a time but like I said classes can actually be used to style more than one element so let's say I wanted to add in another paragraph over here and I wanted this one to be blue as well then I could go ahead and actually just add that class to this element so class equals blue and then I'll say this is another blue para and when I save this now and click refresh this paragraph is blue as well okay so basically just add whichever class you create to whatever paragraph you want to apply the styling to and it doesn't have to be colors obviously it can be anything you can be working with borders or background colors or background images or anything that I've shown you guys in the past few tutorials so that's actually all I have for you guys in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
