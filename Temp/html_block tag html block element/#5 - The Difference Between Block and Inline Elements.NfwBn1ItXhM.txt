hey what's up this is Scott with level up tutorials and in this video we're gonna be explaining the difference between a black level item and an inline item now we're gonna show you what the difference is and what it means when you're placing elements in your HTML so check it out let's get going on that right now so in the last video we talked a little bit about structure and how we're using different elements to do different things despite not having any sort of initial styles like the main element doesn't really provide any sort of initial styles like in terms of font size or things like that like you have with maybe an input or an a header element or something like that however there is an important distinction so let's head to our website I'm going to right click inspect this element and you'll remember I said there was basically no built-in properties however if you remember you select main you see that we have display block and you might be wondering well what is display block and what does it have to do with this main element well the two polar opposites in terms of display our display block and display inline so display block you'll notice all of these header main footer these all get display block along with in the header tag like h1 and a paragraph tag this paragraph tag here they're all block level elements now in HTML you have two types of elements you have a block level element and an inline element now block elements are going to take up the full width they're going to be able to set a width and height on so we could actually say width is 80 percent or something and this block level item will obey that and you can have margin top and bottom left right and padding all the way around as well now inline elements by default do not take up any sort of whip and in fact you cannot assign them a wit so an inline element might be a span attack so we can have a span tag to our build websites and against a span like so and then close this off around the B okay never on the build there so we now have a span tag here and if we refresh you'll see nothing crazy nothing's changed at all if we select span you can see that it is display:inline here it's inherited that but what it's not doing is it's not taking up any sort of width if we were to come here and click on this element style we can give this some temporary styles and we can say display block now what you'll notice is that automatically it's taken up the full width and it is now separating these two paragraph tags when I remove this display block you can see it's definitely in line again now what kind of things can we do to display block that we can't do to in line well we can't add a width if I were to say with 100% it's not going to be taking up 100% it's in fact it's not going to change at all and we can't actually set a height and we can't give it a margin top and bottom if we were to say margin - the top and then say 10 pixels you can see that just by hovering over we don't get any sort of margin at all like we do with the h2 by the way in this inspect element view when you hover over an element in your browser you can see the orange lines above and below the blue selected element well those are actually the margins so if you see over in the bottom right over here you can see that we have the margins right here and we have border padding and then the element itself so as you can see padding will be green border is going to be yellow and margin is going to be this orange color now we'll get into a little bit on when to use margin and when to use petting and but but all you need to know right now about display:inline verse display:inline-block is for block level elements are things that need to take up the whole space and need to have margin with height that stuff applied to them and in line displayed elements are going to be elements that are going to be styled in line with your content like we can take this and even though we can't apply a width margin top to it we can say color red and you can see just the text within this span is getting a mart is getting the color red so if you want to affect something in line you can always wrap it in a span now what other display:inline tags are there well well the basic display block tags are things that we've come across like paragraphs and headings we have these mains form tags header any sort of div unordered lists list unordered lists that sort of stuff we're all going to be display block by default however you can't certainly change them if you'd like for instance we can come in here and say display inline on our h2 and you can see it no longer takes up the entire width but since it's sandwiched in between block level items nothing's going to come up on the line with it but as you can see it's it's no longer taking up the whole width just the width of the text here so we have display inline but as far as elements that are display inline by default most common ones are things like an anchor tag that links to another page a span tag like this one that just allows you to sort of wrap certain pieces of text to style them things like AEM which is an emphasis tag which you can use to make things italicized pretty much anything that you're just using to style a group of text now the ones that you're going to be coming across most often are the anchor tag and the spam tag other than that by default and display inline elements you won't see as much so this is display inline and this is display block I hope that clears up the difference for you in the next video we're going to start talking about how to identify pieces of our content in our HTML using an ID so as always this is Scott with level up tutorials if you have any questions or comments they could come and the video artists up at twitter or facebook at love love to we love to hear from you thanks for watching and we'll see you next one bye
