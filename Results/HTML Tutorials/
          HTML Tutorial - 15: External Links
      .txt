hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 15th to role in this course in this tutorial we'll be beginning our discussion on links and you know the internet won't have been what it is if you know we didn't have this feature of including links in our websites right so the fact that there are so many websites on the Internet and they all have links to one another you know makes the internet or web actually right so it's very easy in HTML to include links in webpages so we're gonna see how we can do that so over here I have an HTML document and you know I have the doctype declaration on line number one and then between the opening and closing HTML tags I have the head section in the body section the title of this web page is all about links part 1 and I'm you know planning to have like 340 doors on links to cover all you know aspects of the anchor tag in HTML which is a tag that we used to include links in our webpages so that's the title and then in the body section I have a paragraph and the paragraph just has the text pane to resume right so what I have done is I have included this text and for this text I have a link so if you would click on the text you would be redirected to you know this website Spain dot info right and the tag and I have used to create a hyperlink of this text is the anchor tag or the ATAC you know that's what is called and it's more popularly known as the anchor tag actually and then there is an attribute of this tag which is you know very important and it's called H ref and you have to set the value of this attribute to the URL to which you want the link to take you so you know in this case since I want to be redirected to www.hsn.com let's say for instance then you won't be taken to Google get in there so you need to have the entire URL here and you know then to close the tag I have just typed in /a at the end of the text so I'll save the file and I'll open it in my web browser and this is how it looks in Google Chrome so you can see that the text pane tourism although I've just used the paragraph tags for ade it is in you know simple text if I would you know take the pointer over it I would see the you know type of pointer being changed to the hand right which is an indication of the fact that it's a link and if I would click on it then I would be taken to the website www.fawziacademy.com yeah at Agra actually and we'll be checking out more attributes more you know values that you can assign to the xref attribute in the coming tutorials and I hope you guys had fun in this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I'll see you in the next video till then take care
