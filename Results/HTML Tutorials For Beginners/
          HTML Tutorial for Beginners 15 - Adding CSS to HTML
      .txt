ah yo people I'm Sean from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 15 adding CSS to your HTML Wow now there's three ways to add CSS to your HTML there may be other secret ways that I don't know of and if you know these ways then feel free to comment below but from what I understand there's three main ways to add CSS to your file the first way is through inline styling where we use the style attribute directly in the tags themselves the second way is within the style types in the head of the document and the third way is by linking up a style sheet in the head and you're going to kind of find out as we go through this video that the first two ways probably not the best ways to do things and I'll explain why as we go along for now we're going to jump back into the code and we're going to start adding styles to our document so here we are back in the index.html file and we're gonna start adding some styles to our document so I said in the introduction that there's three ways of doing it and the first one was by adding inline styles and basically that means we go into the tags themselves in the document and we add styles directly to them so say for example I wanted to style these links these eight tags up here I'd go into the a tag and I'd add another attribute remember we can have more than one attribute on each tag and without the style attribute and this is a global attribute that we can add to pretty much any tag in the document so we use the style attribute to specify specific CSS rules for this tag so don't pay attention to the kind of rules that I'm going to be putting down here this is not a CSS course pay attention to the method that I'm using to add CSS rules to the document I am going to be doing a full CSS course after this HTML one so stay tuned for that but for now just concentrate on the way I'm doing things so we've got our style attribute and we're going to add a couple of rules or maybe just one rule and we're gonna change the color and we'll make it red so I'm gonna preview this in a browser and we can see now the first link that we added the style attribute to exchange red so we can do this certainly we can have these inland styles to tags however imagine this say you had 100 links on your page and you wanted every link read that's gonna be a long and arduous task to go through every single a tag in your document and add this style attribute and then further down the line imagine you wanted to change those links to blue well it's gonna be even longer to go through and delete them then add the blue rules so probably not the most time if you should way of doing things so for that reason I don't really like adding these inline Styles every now and then I'd probably use one to kind of overwrite a different style very sparingly I would probably hardly ever recommend using inline styling but occasionally and let me know they do have the uses so a slightly better way of doing things would be to go up in the head tag and badly style tag which is within eolian and within the style tag we can start in rules to our document so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to target these attacks here and again don't pay attention to the rules I'm using this isn't a CSS course I'm just showing you how we can add them within this style tag here at the top so I'm gonna find this navigation ID here and I'm gonna target up and then within that navigation ID we've got these a link so I'm going to target those and basically what I'm saying here is every a tag within the navigation ID give a color poverty so I'm gonna save that and preview this again in the browser and then we can see we've got all red links that's because the browser has looked at this style rule in the style tag and it said okay well I'm gonna apply this rule to every a tag within the navigation region so it's a lot quicker if you wanted to change all the links on your page you can do it within one line of code rather than go through every single tag however still not the best way and I'm going to tell you why so imagine we had 50 pages and we wanted to change all the links on every page to read we'd still have to go through every page and that at this style block into the head of every page and then later again if we wanted to change that to blue we'd have to go into every page and change the rule to blue in the head type so still not the most kind of time efficient way of doing things so what is the best way of doing things well I'd say the best way of doing things is by adding a link tag here and we did this in one of the earlier tutorials when I was talking about the head we said that we can add our CSS or references in the head which is what we've done and we do this by adding the link tag and we give it a rel attribute which stands for relationship and we're saying that the relationship of this kind of document that we're linking game is a stylesheet so we're saying we're linking a stylesheet into this HTML file the next attribute is type and we're saying that the type of this document will link it in is a text slash CSS file so the browser knows what to expect and the third attribute is the age eight ref attribute and remember this we used to specify the location of whatever we're linking to and we've given this a location of the CSS folder jumps into that folder and then we're finding the main CSS file now I've not added that CSS file yet I was just kind of adding this link in a previous tutorial just to demonstrate how we do it so I'm gonna add that CSS folder and the main dot CSS file now and to do that remember we right-click this kind of bar in the left click new folder name is CSS and within that folder we're going to add a new file and we're going to call that main dot CSS so that's opened up a new kind of style sheet for us and every time we add rules into the style sheet which ever document has this link tag in it it's going to apply those rules to that document so this is the index document we've also got the contact document which is which has the CSS link as well it's also in the how-to and it's also in the lists in fact every page within this mini website we've done has this reference to the main CSS final so when we make changes in this it's going to affect all of those pages at once we don't have to go individually into the head of each of those pages and change the styles right then so again I'm gonna do let's have a look first of all what have we got comment each each page we've got H ones there okay so we've got h1 in each page so I'm gonna target the hip ones and I'm gonna make these a color of blue this time let's mix it up a little bit and we're going to give it a text-decoration:underline so we want all these hate ones to be underlined and then finally text chunks for all the H ones to uppercase so let's save that now and hopefully this should work we'll view first of all the index yay and there we go the h1 is not blue and underlined let's go to the contact us page which we linked up previously and there we go it's also in that page will try the price list that must be H 2 we'll find out prices now this is why it's a good job I did this we're linking to the CSS folder however we're in a subdirectory and if you remember when we talked about navigating directories to jump up a directory first of all to get us into the main directory we need to do the two dots and then the forward slash and then it's going to find the CSS file here so now hopefully this should work let's view it in a browser and there we go that's blue as well underlined so they have it there the three main ways of adding CSS to a HTML document you've got your inline Styles which is probably not a great idea unless from very specific rules then you've got your style tag in their head which is a better way but still not the most kind of time effective way of doing things and then the third and best way is to totally kind of separate your styles from your HTML in an external stylesheet and link to that stylesheet within the head of your page so if you have any questions feel free to comment below subscribe to these videos and I'll see you guys in the next lesson which is going to be about all linking up JavaScript I'll see you guys then
