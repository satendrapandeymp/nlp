welcome to html4 video series this is table part 18 so far we have seen a lot of things in table so now it's time for us to go in action and try to build something which should look something like this all right so as for the game plan let's check out the image first so we are looking at the image and you can see in most of the cases when you look at the website you have a structure something like this where you have header then you got like menu next and then you got page having a two to a layout or three column layout or something like that it depends like how you want to design it and most of the time you might see something like this on the left you might be having a link on the right hand side you'll be having a news what's the upcoming alright and in the middle of the page you have the main content where you want to present what's your content right so this is kind of a structure I have built in here alright so as you can see the structure is over here I'm pleased the header menu navigation links this is not fully complete yet but we are going to we are not going to build something with this but almost something like this but I'm just trying to show you using table you can create you know a certain layout which you exactly want right so if I want to create something like this then how can I do it like you always remember when we dealing with the table but you always have three tags very compulsory one is the table tag one is a TR tag and one is a TD tag TRS with the row and T DS for the table data right once again so now the image is done and you have the layout in front of you now if you want to make this kind of layout what would you do I mean look at the picture over here and if I tell you to think about it and I want something to design using tables how will you do it of course if you are an expert then you know it's very easy but if you are new being then how would you do it so the plan were here is what were you seeing like I'm looking at the header right then I'm looking at the menu everything is a section for me section in the sense everything is like a table for me so if you're looking at the header header is a complete table for me and you can see I have one only TR and TD for it so I explain like what is a structure I have plan everything what you are thinking should be a table and this is where we are bringing the nesting of tables right so what I'll do is I'll create a separate table for headers I'll create a separate table for menu and I'll create the separate table for can our main content alright so now you can see you can see for the main content I have made three compartments so like I have three different things so if you're looking at the structure you can think of it as a left center and right and in the end I have the table for footer so everything is stable so let's do one thing in order to execute this let's go to the place this was a completed version which you saw and let's start building this one so I'll open with notepad all right so I have nothing I have only one table right the only thing I have is a one table right now so like I said everything will be a table so this will be a table for my header all right I'm just planning right now okay the next thing would be this would be a table for my menu whoops all right next this would be a table for my content and this would be a table for my footer all right so so far so good now when I preview this page I mean if I go over here and if I double click on this and try to preview it you don't see anything you just see the content right but you don't see the table because TR and DD is nothing is there so let's start building the office and as for the plan I am thinking to reduce the complexity let's build table and I'm sorry capture zone captures off let's build the header menu first and create the footer as well so you get a clarity like what I'm trying to pull over here right so let's start and start building that right so I'll go with first as TR as you can see nothing you show you you can see like this is one complete box there is no subdivision in it so there's only one TR right one TR and one TD so one this is only a one row you don't see our rows more than that right so this is my row and now I'll create the data so like this TD and I'll say this is my header / DT again okay and now let me have a look the new one right so ctrl f5 so you can see you have the header now but you had a doesn't look like this one don't worry we'll make it something like that so I'll go to index and I'll say style style is a special attribute in which you can style your table or TR now only I want to set the background color to be light green and I want its height to be let's say a hundred pixel height okay so now let's come here and let's refresh as you can see you kind of have the same structure what you had over here right so we have built that and what exactly we did is nothing we just introduced one TR within that we just have written the header obviously when we are building the website so half of the left of the header would be some icon some image on the right-hand side you'll have some awesome title about your website right so but let's not get into that and let's focus over here right so your header is ready so now very good now let's go and let's create the menu as well all right control V and we'll give a color as whoops great gray would be my color and high it would be let's say I'll be keeping the height as 40 and the height of this will be 80 pixel right and now let me refresh and see where we are all right so you have the header oh I'm sorry I forgot to change the content the content should be menno all right so the content should be menu I'm sorry I have made a mistake Altaf s and let me refresh so as you can see the menu is back and seam will be doing that for the footer part as well so where's my footer alright there you are and let's do that home capsule on again cops off he this guy would be gray and this guy would be what was it it was footer I'm sorry so it was footer and closing of table hmm so in order to make this thing the wire double and easily we have done this right so basically what we have done is we have covered the header menu and my footer right so all you can see over here now the last part and last change the change is I have written a simple CSS all right and this CSS means I am applying a special style to all the TD tags available on the page and I'm saying wherever you find the TD tag try to align the text of that TD tag to be Center so now let me hit the reef so you can see all of them are aligned to Center the content is not aligned to center because content is not built yet right if you look at the from the beginning we have completed the header menu as completed content is spending because content does not have any tears or tdys that's why it doesn't do anything right but besides you got the idea right how to build this thing right so in the next video I will show you how can you build this thing and it won't take much time right but at least you will have an idea you know what is a type of structure now you can create using a tables so I guess this would be a very good start for you guys alright so if this video helped you in some way then please subscribe to my channel and share this video with your friends
