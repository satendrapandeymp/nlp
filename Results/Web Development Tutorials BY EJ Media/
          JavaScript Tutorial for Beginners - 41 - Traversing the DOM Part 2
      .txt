in the last video we learned about what traversing the Dom was all about and we moved from the parent to the child and that allowed us to select some of the children to manipulate their element in this video we're essentially going to reverse what we did in the last video so we're going to move upwards rather than downwards we're going to move up so we're going to get the idea of the first paragraph and that will allow us to move up and then we can target the parent note so that's what we're going to do in this video so essentially again like I said we're just going to reverse what we did in the last video and that's another way to traverse the DOM you can go up you can go sideways and you can go down so let's take a look at the code here and I've inserted an ID here because we need to target one of these paragraphs and then that will allow us to get the parent node so let's flip over to the JavaScript code and we'll fill this in so I'll go ahead and copy and paste the first line here and you can see as I said we're starting out with a child so that's the first object that we're going to create and we're going to go ahead and get the ID and of course it is p1 and now of course we can specify the parent node and so we create our parent object we use the child object we just created and then we can just specify parent node and that will give us this div right here now you will remember in the last video we had to specify which child node we wanted to target that's not the case here because there is only one parent so it will only target this parent node we don't have to specify a position and so that's kind of nice and then we'll do what we did in the last video we're just going to change the text color to blue and we know all about what this line does now so let's go ahead and save everything up and let's make sure this works and you will remember since we are setting the color of the text to blue all these child elements should inherit that from the div and so the color will change for all the text in this section and it did that's what we expected now you can also specify parent element but again there is no difference because it'll just pull the element here it's one in the same same node same element we don't have to specify any type of position or anything so it should work exactly the same so we'll just save this here and go ahead and run this and we should get the same results and we did okay we will do one more video on traversing the dumb and actually we're going to go from sibling to sibling to sibling you can go sideways like I've mentioned so we'll talk about that in the next video see you guys
