ah yo people I'm sure from the net ninja and this is HTML basics for lesson 13 the diptych now I know I've used the div tag here and there in previous lessons but I've never really explained what it's for or what it's about so that's what this lesson is all about and we're going to do that or right now so the div tag simply stands for division and that's essentially what a div tag is all about it divides sections of code into segments in essence we use the div tag to group content into specific sections and that's what we're going to do now okay I'm here back in the index file exactly where I left it off last time and like I said the div tag is used to divide content into specific sections so say for example we have this kind of top bit here which is the banner and then the welcome text we could consider that some kind of top section like a section on its own we could put a div tag around that likewise this UL tag here which is the navigator the navigation we could wrap all this within a div tag too because it's all one section and it's separate from the topic so we're going to start putting some div tags around these things here so we'll open with a div like that and then close with a div copy and paste that to the bottom and then I'm just going to indent these three lines here by highlighting and clicking tab just for readability and we're going to do exactly the same with other sections on our website so we'll do the UL tag here indent nap and then I think this here types of fish we sell I'd consider that a section of its own so I'm going to pop that in a div tag and indent the code in between I think the about the about Us section here is worthy of a section of its own so I'm going to pop that within a div tag to and indent the code oops and then finally we've got this contact or section at the bottom which I think also belongs in its own div tag so there we go now each section on this web page is contained within this division tag so it's divided into all these different segments and if I preview this in a browser right now it's going to have no visual impact whatsoever however when we start using the divs with IDs classes and CSS that's when it becomes really useful we can start applying styles to the elements within each div section so I think there's three main reasons I'd use a div tag on my HTML document first of all it logically divides the content intersections so that it's easier for me as a developer to come back into the code and know where everything is as well as other developers if they were to pick up this code and look at it they can see that it's divided into logical sections and they know where everything is the second reason is to do with CSS when we start using CSS it's going to become a little easier to attach certain styles to elements within the document when they're divided into specific regions especially when we combine the div tags with IDs and classes which I'm going to teach you about shortly in probably the next few lessons thirdly it's for semantic reasons you're going to see in the next few lessons as we start to use IDs and classes that we can give these different sections that we divide in in essence a name our identifier which kind of represents that area for example a header area which would be this top bit here or a navigation area which is going to be this part so like I said div tags themselves have no visual impact on our page but when we combine these with CSS rules and ID's that's when it's going to come into play so I mean that's all there is to show you about the div tag itself in the next few tutorials I'm going to talk about IDs and classes and see assess a little bit more so we'll expand on these div tags then and I'll see you guys in the next lesson if you have any questions don't forget to comment below and subscribe to these videos
