welcome to the 13th tutorial on beginning CSS today we're going to look at web colors and so this is a very important subject adding color to your website now there are three primary ways to add colors the first is to use the 16 primary colors the second way is to use RGB values and the third way is to use hex codes but first let's talk about the 16 primary colors and we've been using those right for our text we made some of our text blue we made some of our text purple and the nice thing about these is you can just call them by name and you get exactly what you would expect to get and so let's go ahead and use a primary color again and I'll introduce a new property too as well and that is background - color and if you put that in the body section that will actually give us a background color for our entire webpage so let's do that and let's pick line so we'll pick one of the primary colors line and again we always close with a semicolon let's save our stylesheet let's open up our page and there you can see we've got lime as a background now so let's close this out and so that's pretty self-explanatory how to use the primary colors now let's take a look at RGB values now RGB values are always a mix between red green and blue those are the three primary colors and all other colors in the spectrum are a mixture of those three colors so in order to get yellow there's a mix of green and there's a mix of red in order to get pink it's a mixture between red and blue but these are just the basic combinations now if I added a lot more red than blue you would get another color here and so that's where you use the RGB values and so let's go ahead and use that in our CSS code now and so let's go ahead and open up Microsoft Paint or any paint application that you have they all will give you your RGB values and then let's hit edit colors and let's go to let's just find a custom color here and we'll drag this over here to this pink and then we'll move this slide bar up here and these are the RGB values right here we've got 244 red these are numeric values we've got 28 for green and 235 for blue and of course that corresponds to over here to these mixtures in between here that would be this is a mixture that we're going to get so we're going to get some sort of pink but you can see we've got mostly red less green and a little bit less blue so that's the mixture so let's go back to our CSS code and I'm just going to copy and paste this into here so you specify RGB and then here are the three values the first value that goes in here is the red value the second is for green and the third is for blue so let's go ahead and add those now so we had 244 red and was it 28 for green and 235 for blue and let's go ahead and save this and you can see we've got our pink background so what this does using the RGB value system you get access to millions of colors and so that's going to give you a lot more flexibility in terms of the color combinations than just the 16 primary colors final way is to use hex code and that's actually what I prefer to use the hex codes rather than the RGB they kind of do the same thing they give you access to millions of colors I just think it's easier to use hex codes and actually I have an extra semicolon there for some reason okay okay let's close that out now how do you get a hex code well one of the things you can do we're not going to and you can do this yourself you can go out to Google and take these values and there are converters out there that will convert it to the hexa code and then you get the hexa code so all we do is put in the pound sign and then this is one I just remember because I've used it before my websites and I really like it phox phox CF 79 and let's go ahead and save this and let's open this up and there you can see I've actually used this color on my websites many times and I really like it as a background color so let's actually keep that as our background color for our web page but again this represents an RGB value that was that I had converted into hex code and you see how much easier it is to put this hex code here it's a lot easier now what I recommend you do is this is how I do it to remember these hex codes because let's say you find a you know color out of the 16 million colors that are out there or whatever and you forget it well good luck trying to find that again so what you want to do is write these down and actually what I do is I usually paste the color in Windows paint and then right below it I'll actually put this in text right below it and so then that way I can remember that color that specific color that I wanted that specific hex code okay that is going to do it for web colors I will see you guys in the next video
