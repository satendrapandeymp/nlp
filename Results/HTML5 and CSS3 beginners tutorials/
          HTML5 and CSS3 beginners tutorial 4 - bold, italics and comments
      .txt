hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number four and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at how to bold and italicize italicized text in HTML and we're also going to take a look at comments and the horizontal rule so the first thing we can do is just delete all this code from the previous tutorial and now to bold or italicize something we need to have some text on our screen so let's go ahead and just put out a paragraph and this paragraph can just say this text will be bold and something will be in italics too and I see there's a bunch of typos but we'll just leave them alone okay so if I run this in Firefox now I'll get a paragraph printed on the screen but you guys already know that so I'm not even going to waste my time showing you so let's go ahead and bold something first okay so let's say I wanted the word bold to be displayed in bold like in bold print then I'd go ahead and I'd start off a strong tag okay so strong in HTML means bold and that means okay we're going to start bolding everything from this tag until we get to an ending strong tag so let's go ahead and end this off over here and now when we refresh this in Firefox we should get just this word bold in bold print so let's go ahead and save that run in Firefox and as you can see this text will be bold so bold is actually bolded and everything else is normal and if we want to bold something else we could go ahead and just put in the strong tag over there and and it off over here don't forget the closing slash so go ahead and save this now and when we refresh now just this text has been bolded so that's cool let's take a look at how to actually emphasize something or put it in italics okay and I actually just gave you a hint at what the tag is so we'll emphasize this these two words italics - okay so to put something in italics you're going to go ahead and type in the tag e/m and then ending a.m. where you would like it to stop okay so this means that the word italics and two are going to be italicized so if we go ahead and we save this now come back to fire flock for fire flocks and click refresh we now have the words italics to being italicized so that's cool now the next thing I said I wanted to talk to you guys about was the horizontal rule so let's say I had two completely separate paragraphs let's go ahead and make one and this can just say man I like making tutorials or something like that for you okay let's say we wanted this to be clear to the user that these are two completely separate paragraphs okay so this would be one and that would be the other and you want to actually divide them with like some kind of a line okay then we've got this tag called the horizontal rule which is actually just H R with a closing slash so similar to the BR tag except this one makes a line instead of breaking down a line okay so let's go ahead and save this and then we'll we'll go back to firefox and click refresh and as you can see we've got the one paragraph and then we've got this line in the middle which clearly separates these two paragraphs so we've at least made clear to the user that this is one paragraph and that is another one that is where we would use this horizontal rule tag but there's a whole bunch of other uses for it yes you guys will see fit to use it wherever you need okay and the last thing I wanted to talk to you guys about was comments in HTML okay now comments are basically words that you want the browser to ignore but still notes that you can see yourself so let's say I wasn't actually happy with this paragraph and I wanted to change it before I put it up on my website or maybe I thought there were a few typos and then I just want to put a comment here to tell whoever looks at this code after me or maybe if I look at it in a month's time just want to leave a note for myself like check this paragraph here there might be typos okay I can't just go ahead and write check this paragraph there might be typos typers okay I can't just go ahead and type something like that because when I do that it shows up in the browser so the browser is clearly not ignoring it so if I actually want the browser to ignore these words but I still want to be able to see them in the text editor I can go ahead and have to type in these symbols so it starts off with the smaller than sign then the exclamation mark and then you have to put in I guess this thing called a hyphen or a minus sign so you have to put two of those in and then you need to go to the end of wherever your comment is and go - - and the greater than sign okay so that is how you make a comment and obviously everything in the comment turns green if you're using notepad plus plus so then you know where your comment starts and where it ends what you saw earlier that all of this was green like that that means my comment hasn't ended yet and this is all going to be ignored by the browser so we're not even going to get that stuff showing up if we don't close our tag properly just go ahead and save us now and click refresh and as you can see my comment doesn't show up how it was right here so that's not showing up anymore but I can still see it here in notepad plus plus so I know okay I need to check this paragraph there could be some typos so that that's why comments are useful okay so that's actually all I have for you guys in this video thank you very much for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys next time
