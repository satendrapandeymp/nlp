hi guys welcome to an AirAsia technologies this is a barrage in this video session will observe image tag and anchors almost all in HTML 4.01 IMG and anchors are important tax image is a non-paid attack it is used to insert images on the web page IMG is the spell on your screen very clearly visible to you IMG it is used to insert images these are classified two types internal as well as external without any action the image which is loading is called internal image if you perform an action if an image is loaded that is called external image image tag has different attributes non-paid tag already said or IMG forward slash self closer tag it has different attributes and parameters we'll observe one by one first three ethically attributes parameters source image path local path you can provide global path you can provide file path we can provide and web a path also we can provide border always in pixels height pixels we can provide percentage we can provide with the pixels percentage align left right top middle bottom regarding this align there is a node point also I'll provide all to any text alternative text title when you mouse over to image what title you required under the cursor is called title attribute so all together these attributes one by one we can observe I made already regarding align attribute there is a note point available aligned attributes supporting five parameters among these five parameters left and right applicable to image top middle bottom applicable to image with text for example there is a image available I want to display on the image nourish eye technologies and then you are writing align is equal to top the text will display image top for example same text you want to see middle of the image aligned is equal to middle we are writing same text we want to see bottom of the image aligned is equal to bottom we are writing this is align attribute parameters practically will move one by one how we are going to work on live webpage as usual HTML open HTML close and remaining tatts image tag with the attributes come down to body fly directly IMG SRC source equal to image tag HTML 5 dot the pnj provided initial have not providing any width and height first practically we can check it so image came so by default whatever default image width and height available that is applied change any image for example HTML logo you want to display wheres refresh that HTML this is HTML official logo this logo is very clear and in between angular total world available that indicates it is completely web and web related information in the web everything available this logo itself very clear and simple now I will try to change another image also but before that I want to apply width equal to 200 pixels let me first that height equal to 100 pixels double quotation single quotation any one no quotation also no problem if you are not providing by default pixels only by default unit in HTML environment pixels right and height completed with completed next attribute is border is equal to I want to know the thickness border to pixels and any browser other browser also you can execute and check it and image little bit colorful and moment available visible will be good any extinction water dot gif all our global path images I am providing any browser also no issue and by default this border is coming in black color you want to apply different borders different colors we should go to cascading stylesheets of mechanism definitely that attribute also will apply I will show you right and source width height as well as border now for example if I open google.com just information purpose I am opening that for a better understanding once I open google.com and their information available and just mouse over Google it is a title come back mouse over no title I provided now we need a title means just title is equal to I want to provide nourish ie technologies I provided that now come back refresh mouse over the ratio technologies and once it means a resource for example not available alt alternative text sorry no image for example image already perfectly loaded now you are unable to see all the property now it means path the wrong provided or wrong image you provided now alternative text you can see sorry no image when image available extra hidden it means not available text shows next attribute we can observe now image available text will be hidden and what attributes available source we did border we did height width alt title align yes aligned we can apply by default align left side already in several video sessions I made in HTML environment or in the web base areas by default aligned maintains the left side now I want to know align is equal to right side refresh that perfectly right side sat right now this is image tag related attributes I need to discuss top a middle bottom parameters related to align attribute applicable to text with image now I am coming back I am changing my image html5 dot PNG Allen also I am NOT taking align I am removing yes refresh now once that is completed now title does not require and all too property also I am removing because better to understand all the properties I am removing both are already observed that salt refresh little bit encouraged html5 logo that is the before my image I am keeping nourish I end of my image a kept technologies this width also 150 M doing inside align is equal to top save it come to web page and run that IMG tag nourish IE technologies perfectly top of the image displayed this align not for image for the text now I want to display same text Middle top completed middle I am showing right to come back middle of the image and I want the bottom come back and observe your bottom so these are the align related parameters now generally image tag level old Philpott I am showing means one folder I created there my HTML file available there only my images available for example my image in different location available come to my system select whereever image available for example I require this image right to click properties copy the path command paste source backward slash and check the image name to dot jpg is the same name I am providing here to dot a peach if you need name also you can change no issue so this is the local path now I am removing narration technologies alignment does not require for me now no align bottom nothing normal image because already you understood sometimes we are called closing image tag like this also close no problem self or closer tag forcefully closer tag now refresh on the web page displayed same example refreshing on your firefox not a display better that time you can show alt also Alt alt is equal to sorry no image sorry no image come back refresh actually image is there resource available but your Firefox browser unable to recognize local path all in the video session 3 I met very clearly this now in that situation we are adding file colon ripple for / refresh perfectly now you want to increase width is increased to 5-0 refresh so like this the image we can view in different ways and another one is file path the local path as well as global path now for example my image available in other website third party areas so that time also we can do for example I am coming to Gmail application so Gmail environment area different different logos available that logo are this Google logo also we can able to just come down that area right to click right to click any one for example I want this one go to properties copy the path very clearly available device dot jpg now paste in your source area just you can paste that internet connection mandatory come to your web page and refresh completely whatever the image available on your Gmail application same thing you can able to see here means from third-party websites also we can bring sometimes whenever you are going to access so it is not possible means if they won't allow maybe website owners or other members they are not allowing to copy that if you right-click also path not visible if visible only we can able to bring if not visible we are unable to for example this is LIC you want to bring the banner something just right click go to properties and once image path visible you can copy and paste and any kind of website for example again Gmail level only we can observe and here male symbol available right to click properties and copy the path you can provide so any kind of image we can able to like this so me while I can try to Google Play properties already previously also seen this example with the body tag now I am showing with image tag again copy that and paste it refresh that right once you are refreshing on your web browser is very clear level so this is about your IMG image attack various various resources I kept after IMG tag we can see HTML anchor tag anchor is nothing but links how to link one web page to another web page one webpage to another website and one website to another website actually anchor means navigate if anchor tag is not available it is very trouble to us for example in Eris technologies website that is ITT own 50 pages available 100 pages available are two thousand pages available right now you are browsing first page you want to view latest batches information that is maybe 100 page you want to move to latest batches information just you are clicking on new batches if the link are not available you need to travel all these pages maybe it takes 2 hours 3 4 fires we don't have time so simply time killing process with anchor time saving process easily we can navigate within the website within the page other than the website so that anchor is divided into two types means anchor links one is internal links second one is external links what is internal link what is external link generally within the web page within the website for example website has 2000 pages of course we have said as only two pages okay any link available inside that it is internal link only but a webpage having means one link for example in AirAsia 80 calm there is a link available sessions calm it nourish Aidid calm you are seeing and you want to view what is the latest jobs information just you click on the search results immediately it is redirect into search items that is external link because it is leading to another website not parasite e.com website within the nourish I did not compensate what we are calling internal links so these links are making with the help of anchor tag so that is is generally we are using name so anchor tag with attributes so different different attributes we can see anchor tag generally we are writing with simple a character and it is a paid tag we can link different resources what are the attributes available first one-by-one attributes we can see yes these are the attributes and parameters available just I am zooming and HF hypertext reference name any name target underscore blank underscore apparent any name like this attributes available these attributes one by one we can apply on that anchor tag H ref hypertext reference HTTP colon double /ww dot nourish i t.com double quotation close then I am giving NIT that's all I provided only one attribute H ref just I am clicking now on that NIT just refresh and mouse over to NIT left hand side www.narang.com clearly showing means once you click it is redirecting to that website click on that welcome to nourish IT right displayed so complete information so it is nourished IT dot-com website now come back to that link Hof you provided next time writing name attribute any name you can write name commonly we are using javascript reference purpose now I am writing just a name hi no issue the behavior same available website name I am changing as I n nourish IT dot in refresh again mouse over it is coming just to click on that it takes some time to redirect redirected one by one so whenever it is redirected you have seen very clearly that nourish IT dot-com dot in this is so like this redirections available now another attribute available target before entering into target these links we are calling as text links a text is the mediator between the link whatever the resource you are providing and our text so once you are clicking how it is redirecting it is showing now come back and provide a target target is equal to I am providing underscore blank once blank you provided means it is redirecting to blank page nothing is that it is redirecting to blank tab or blank window whichever possible it is redirecting that now just I want to refresh on the web page refresh once I click right now there are the no tabs available the resource nourish I T dot in opening on new tab or new window now facility available tab will take opening on new tab that is underscore blank app ability now I am coming back close it now underscore parent I am doing underscore parent and by default nature both are same if you say underscore parent if you are going to refresh that it opens on the same page by default Nationals on the same page so this is a default image come back again for example underscore any name available name I am providing NIT any name underscore black both are same means it redirect to new tab or new window yes perfectly happens perfectly happens so this is Ankur attack almost all once you are clicking in my web page it is going to insert the resources inside within the web page website internal outside is nothing but external links these links again different types we can use as image links local links and you can provide email links also using anchor tag and if you are coming to our source code area just to take that anchor tag available your attributes already there now I am removing target target clearly explained now I want to link with image IMG image tag source equal to I am taking HTML file dot the PNG width also less I am providing 100 pixels height I am providing 100 pixels 50 pixels all and providing double quotation single quotation not a matter but industry purpose you need to provide right but best habit is provide double quotation that is always good programming should not be neglect single quotation also okay reasonable now if i refresh it is coming image if you mouse over narration cited dot in giving now that related will fit allah will provide that is what WG dot o arch what WG dot o-r-g now just if i refresh the website and if I click it is redirecting to web hypertext application technology working group web site it is a mother web site of html5 version you need any html5 related information or updates please visit what WG dot o-r-g now come back to our original source code area so these are the image links if you mouse over to image there is an icon displaying this is a pointer we are calling this cursor name now next one I said to local links within the computer for example resources available that path you are providing C Drive something already shown to you and finally you want to provide electronic mail related links but before that you need to configure pop3 server in your system post office protocol version 3 it is coming with Microsoft Outlook Express as well as Mozilla Thunderbird once you can view in Internet environment also if you configure that mail system then it is perfectly working email links in other video session definitely we can see how to configure that pop3 mail server for more videos visit youtube.com slash narration you
