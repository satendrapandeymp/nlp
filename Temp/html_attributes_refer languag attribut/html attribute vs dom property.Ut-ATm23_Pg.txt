this is part 10 of Anglet 2 tutorial in this video we'll discuss the difference between HTML attribute and Dom property first let's understand what is Dom when a web browser loads this HTML it creates a Dom that looks like this Dom stands for document object model notice at the top of the Dom tree we have the window object underneath that we have the document object and underneath that we have the HTML object this HTML object represents this HTML element right here and underneath the HTML object we have had in body objects just like how we have hidden body elements under the HTML element and then underneath a head we have title similarly underneath body we have script and div and under there we have h1 object so basically you can think of this Dom as an API that is application programming interface for this HTML so we can use programming languages like JavaScript or JavaScript frameworks like angular to access and modify these HTML elements using their corresponding Dom objects so in other words Dom contains the HTML elements as objects their properties methods and events and it is a standard for accessing modifying adding or deleting HTML elements in our previous two videos we discussed interpolation and property binding here is an example for property binding and this is an example for interpolation if you notice both these examples it looks like we are binding two disabled attribute of the button element but that's not true they're actually binding to disable the property of the button object in the Dom keep in mind angular data binding is all about binding to Dom object properties and not HTML element attributes so the obvious question that comes to our mind at this point is what's the difference between an HTML attribute and a Dom property attributes are defined by the HTML whereas properties are defined by the dorm attributes initialized on properties once the initialization is complete the attributes job is done and they effectively disappear after that property values can change whereas attribute value card let's actually prove this last point with an example within the butane plate of our AB component let's include an input element notice I have set the ID to input ID type this text and look at the value attribute here I have set it to comm so the job of this value attribute of this input element is to initialize value property of the input object in the Dom so at this point let's run our application by pressing ctrl f5 so notice within the textbox we see the value Tom at this point let's launch browser developer tools by pressing f12 and let's click on the console tab now what we want to do is retrieve the value of this input element value attribute to do that we are going to make use of this ID of the input element which is input ID so within the console we are going to use the get attribute method to get the value of the attribute value you remember we have initialized the value attribute to Tom and that's what we see right here so this is the value of the attribute value now we know there will be a corresponding value property for the input object in the Dom now let's try to get the value we have in that value property now to do that again we are going to use the ID of the input element and this time we are going to use the value property of the input object in the Dom and again even in that value property we have a value of Tom now let's change the value that we have in the textbox to Mary now let's try to retreat the attribute value using get attribute method notice the value attribute still has Tom and let's see what we have in the value property of the input object in the Dom notice the value property in the Dom has got the updated value so keep in mind property values can change whereas attribute value can't so here we've got two important points to keep in mind HTML attributes and the Dom properties are different things angler binding works with properties and events and not add views in both these examples disabled is storm property and not at Butte thank you for listening and have a great day
