you our prints and my name is AJ I am back with a new tutorial for the web series of learn HTML part 3 today we are going to learn ordered lists and unordered lists and the type of attributes for the ordered lists and unordered lists the two attributes for ordered lists the type and this chart and there are there is one attribute for ordered lists that is only unordered list is only type so ordered list is basically a type of list you Erin you want to show some kind of numbering like 1 2 3 4 ABCD something and unordered lists are those lists where you just put some circles or squares and you don't want to show the number that will be depending upon the requirement you are facing with the client or as per your wish or as per the designing you want to display so we do straight away go with the coding part so first I will make the copy of this page so that we don't have to do everything over and over again and I will continue the coding in the same page only so whenever you guys want you can go straight away on the website eggs ID or comp and download these pages so that you will get the coding directly if you want to have a look have a sneak peak in the coding so this was the previous code we did and if you want to see it in the browser so just click on open yes so this was the coding we tried to do last time I will not be removing any part of this code so that you guys remember what we did did in the last same now if we have to go all create a difference between each and every tutorial so this was this was part one and I'll is part two sorry for to learn html5 to write T ml for two so you use your we are good tool and now we will do this that's one again such one guys I am doing very hard and sitting in some kind of too hot room to give you some good tutorial so kindly do take these lessons seriously and if you have any questions you can write it down below in the comments I will get back to you with the answer either in the comments or with a video whatever is required from your side so if we go here solar national power 3 we this chart coding here for three first year we decided to start with ordered list right or the list or the list so here we start here we started ordered list and here we close or the list now you can create list items this is order L is the short form for ordered list and alai is the short form for list item remember the closing tag for Li is optional in HTML but if you want to go with the XHTML and current days search engine optimisation and HTML validation you should use close tag with each and every item otherwise search engines will drop your rankings because of unstructured or improper HTML tags okay item 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 times 5 times - ok let's make it ten I'll give you one more example and this only two six seven eight nine and ten so now I'm going to show you how it is let us see what we haven't saved if we shall save it ah system has been pleased just give me a moment guys okay now it's saved so just becomes refresh so these are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten now we were talking about one more attribute the type attribute in ordered lists and you have total five four verses of one two three four here you have four four or five type attribute values for the type attribute and what I will do I will copy this so that you can you guys can see the difference and what's the use of particular attribute value that is checked to you so so we are having type type if I say L in the type attributed by price par value as hi this is supposed to be drawn Roman numbers so so see and if I give you the example of next attribute value and if you mark it as I means capital I so it will go as capital Roman numbers now if we first really see this small first capital afterwards so if you pass value of the type attribute as a this will charge nothing like this and if you will do this then you will have this see the difference so if you don't mention any the attribute type so it will do take the default numbering one two three four five six seven nine ten the numeric one if you mention a small I will take the roman numbers like the in roman numbers and small if you pass the value of type attribute as capital I it will take the Roman capital Roman numbers if you pass the value of type as Mali it will take this list it will a few pounds the value as capital a in the type attribute you will get this list now we are coming to start that start attribute of your this order list so if I say if you want to start say suppose this list from eleven not from ten so you have to mention it as 11 okay oops sorry this thing works with numeric I suppose now based on problem guys oh sorry there is not some problem I have misspelled so I try and remember see if you have mrs. spelled any attribute or any tag it will not be recognized by browser and it can create problem for you and you can you will be scratching your head over and over again but you will not find any error because there is no error it is the Miss spelling mrs. spend that tag or it will be so same thing if you drive with this say a then you will get C so you don't have to do anything if I type 1 when I type this I get the numbering from this one this may be like if you have to this is useful when you have to use some text here then a list of certain items say suppose 10 item then a paragraph then you have to continue the list of items so you don't have to type in the numbers again and again and the use of ordered list is used is the added best when you have to increase or decrease the item from the middle of the list so say suppose if the list of 100 items and you have to insert any item at 50 as position you will not have to renumber each and every item you can simply insert it with the li type and it will reorder automatically now we will see the same things with unordered list I will copy this so that it I'll make it fast to the other end so we will remove these tags first because these checks are not used super for unordered list or they were useful for the order lists only now here see this is unordered list variant you don't have any numbers you have only dots mentioning that means you don't want to display the numbers there is no relevance if there is no relevance of the numbers if you might want to mention certain points like a bulleted point field so you can use unordered lists we have do we do have a type attribute for unordered list as well and you see the user face it right now if I type SQ a are e square so we get these square bullets so this type ID there is a there are three values for the type attribute for in unordered list so the second one is circle go and refresh you like these bulleted lists and the third one is the default one basically if you don't mention it you will get this third one only and this one is disk so see this is the default one the disk is the default one for any browser if you don't mention the type attribute you will get this unordered list as the disk okay so why is this was it for the for this video I am giving you a very short lesson so that you can grasp this these lessons very easily and you don't forget anything and I will start increasing the frequency of the video so that you guys get daily videos and you can learn it fast enough so if you want to see the whole tutorial you can change it as a comp or if you want to receive the updates from YouTube regarding this chain you can subscribe on subscribe button and if you want to share the information and
