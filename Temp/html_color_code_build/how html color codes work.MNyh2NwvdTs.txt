hi my name is Janice and this is a video presentation on HTML color codes and the math and science behind their function or for a more straightforward less wordy tile that is less of a run-on sentence how HTML color codes work so before I even go into any of that coding stuff what is color color comes from light or more specifically a range of visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum and white lights are just sunlight while is seen as color this actually contains all colors as observed when it is refracted through a prism like so are I see different colors on this color less light is shine unto an object which absorbs all the color in the light except for in this case red which bounces off into our eyes which creates and sense information to our brains which then processes this information and perceives the object as a color red colors can also be described where the property is hue the different shades of a color saturation or chroma which is the intensity of a color and brightness also known as value like news 10 stone etc which describes the Emma back or white in the color the collective range of colors is called a spectrum which has been represented with a number of different modes such as EHS em all the HSV model the Munsell model and the color wood model today we have a car wheel that looks something like this in this video though we're gonna focus a bit more on these two models specifically the one on the left the RGB model I'll also talk a bit about the CMYK model on the right so CMYK model CMYK stands for San magenta yellow and key the origin of the Kay is kind of debated one theory I found said that Kate was used insert B to represent black because it will often be confused with blue which could also be represented with B anyways CMYK is a subtractive color model which basically means that when all the colors are added together they create black CMYK is most commonly used in printing there are a lot of other things I could talk about regarding CMYK imprinting such as half-tones and color gamut but as I mentioned earlier I will be focusing more on the RGB model in this video and the RGB mall RGB stands for red green and blue the RGB color mode is an eye color system which means that when you add up all the colors red green and blue it turns into white this system is using electronic displays such as the screen of your TV the screen of your phone and the screen of your computer the RGB color system also plays an essential role and HTML color coding an HTML color code is basically a six digit code that determines the color of something in the coding of a website two simple codes that you may already know are ffffff for white and zero zero zero zero zero zero for back although these digits may seem completely random and parentless for a lot of colors how it works is actually pretty simple the first two digits represent the amount of red and a colored the next two digits represent the in off green in a color and the last two digits represent the amount of blue in a color the amounts of each colour are determined by two digit value that goes from 0 to 255 by using a hexadecimal numerical system which basically means that instead of just using numbers 0 to 9 numbers go from zero to nine and an eight to that so the number after nine for example will be a instead of 10 and 11 will be B as of 1112 a B C 13 what B D 14 will be e 15 would be F and so on so forth the lowest possible value is 0 0 and the highest is FF by combining different values of red green and blue different colors are created yellow for example is created when red and green are combined together and Gray's are created when all 3 primary colors are the same value in total there are a whopping 16,777,216 possible combinations for HTML color codes a Shamal color codes are used in graphic software such as Photoshop and play an important role in the coding of a website power is a very complex subject and coding is as well so this is just a very brief explanation on the basics of HTML color coding I hope you could get something of this video thank you for listening have a nice day
