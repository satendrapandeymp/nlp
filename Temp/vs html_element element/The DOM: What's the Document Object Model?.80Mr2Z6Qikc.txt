in these videos we are going to be talking about the document object model also known as the Dom the do and you'll see that referred to a lot particularly as you work with jQuery which we'll get into a little bit later the document object model is the browser's internal programmatic representation of the web page what that means is you can manipulate the document object model and change the page without actually going in and changing any of the HTML now you have to use a write language like JavaScript or a library of JavaScript like jQuery to access and talk to the Dom but it can be a really powerful tool both as a programmer and as a user of websites technically the dong is also an API if you're not familiar with api's that's fine but remember this is a type of API api's are really powerful and can do a lot of things if you've already been using javascript and particularly jQuery you already been working with the Dom it's pretty intuitive once you get used to a language like jQuery let's talk about some examples of a document object model manipulation these examples are pure JavaScript just pure vanilla JavaScript document that get element by ID and then the ID is something that maybe you've seen before in some of the earlier challenges element get elements by tag name is another example and if you want to create something totally new document dot create element and then the name of that element you don't have to remember this this is not a lesson on how to manipulate the document object model just that sort of how it's possible you understand the concept and if you already are using some of these examples maybe you can connect those dots a little bit better let's talk about some jQuery examples for this example in jQuery there's the same jQuery notation with the dollar sign and in here it's got the hash tag from the class so here is selecting the box to class and it's appending adding the string this is now in box two so if you already done the jQuery challenges you might be like oh yeah I recognize that kind of stuff what you've been doing is manipulating the document object model to actually change what's being displayed on a webpage without changing the HTML what I want you to take away from this video is in the document object model is technically an API that is inside of your browser it is easy to use so even if you can't wrap your head around the concept of document object model necessarily don't be intimidated by it don't be afraid to start using languages like JavaScript and the library like jQuery to start changing the context of a page without changing the actual HTML when you do that using these languages or other languages you are manipulating the document object model
