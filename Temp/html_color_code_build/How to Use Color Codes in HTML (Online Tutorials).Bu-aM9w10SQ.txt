since HTML is all based in text there's a special way to handle putting colors on the page we'll have a look at that in this video now let's go ahead and talk about how we can add color and when we're using HTML and because hTML is just text that were typing onto a page of course we're gonna have to represent color with some numbers and letters and that's how it's gonna work it's something called a hexadecimal number and we can see here on my little webpage example I'm just trying to specify a font color here with this font tag and here I can see my hexadecimal number drawn out here and it's always preceded by this pound sign followed by six digits and this right off the bat is just set to six zeroes which was actually set to black and if I come and take a preview of my page here here I can see hello welcome my website is indeed black text and this is how the hexadecimal number is working it's representing the colored lights inside of a pixel as the pixels made up of three lights a red light a green light and a blue light and we can see these first two digits here are representing the red pixel the red light pardon me these two are representing the green these last two here we representing the blue and we can tweak these let's just say I'm going to turn these red ones fully on and I'm actually going to put two F's in here like this and if I go preview my page I can see because I turn those red ones on my text actually does happen to be red that's great however you don't want to have to sit here and play a guessing game and fiddle around with these to find the color you want we want to be able to find exactly the color we need and put it in here as a hexadecimal and we can do that pretty simply inside of web builder here I'll show you an alternative way as well if you're not using web builder that worked fine I'm just gonna erase the accessible number I have in here and right from web builder there's this little button here called the insert color I'm gonna press that and it just brings up a color picker and here I can go through and there's a bunch of different palettes I can use up here at the top I can switch through and I could find say I want to use this nice green here pick the green and you can see here it at the top it's giving me this hexadecimal number notice the green pixels here are are on the most for this green color makes sense and we're gonna go ahead and press ok and it's going to put that hexadecimal number right in there for us if I go and preview the page I can see great my text is turned green so if you're not using web builder if you're say just using nope and you don't have that ability to generate the hexadecimal numbers that way there's a nice little site that adobe has actually called adobe cooler which lets us go in and pick some colors from their color wheel that's a really neat program you can pick color harmonies and stuff like that and I'll show you what it looks like here fire it up there it is the web address is right here at the top coolerado adobe.com great and I could spend a whole lot of time talking about how this works it's a pretty neat program I'd recommend playing around with it getting used to it but here on this color wheel I can come in and pick the color that I want there's my base color I can come in here it's going to generate a hexadecimal number for me here right at the bottom and I can just take that copy into web builder and it's gonna give me that color in my HTML so that's how you use colors on your page don't forget to put that pound sign in front of your hexadecimal numbers
