in this video we're going to talk about how to highlight a particular box that was filled out in error and in this case we're going to provide focus to the first text box and that is the name text box so what we want to do is if the user fills it out incorrectly we want that box to be highlighted in red with a red border and I'll show you that in a minute now the method that we need to use is the focus method and so that's what we're going to do now where to put that well the good place to do that is after the alert so after the user clicks okay to the alert box then we will provide focus to the element that was in error in this case of course it is the input element with name our name text box so first thing we need to do is go right here and we're just going to call our box object and we're just going to call the focus method and so what this does is it just provides focus back to our box element right here it'll just highlight it but that in itself won't do a lot now that we've called this we want to provide a little styling with that red border so I'll just copy and paste the line of code I have and here it is we're calling our box object we're using the style object and then we're using the border property and then we just specify solid 3px red most of you will have recognized that by now and so if this works correctly if they fill out this text box wrong this of course will be true and this code will be executed only this time focus will be provided back to the element and we will highlight it with a red border now I do want to point out before we run this we're only going to cover this outcome right here this outcome where it's true they filled out the first text box wrong and they filled out the second one correctly we will talk about how to provide focus to multiple elements in another video so let's go ahead and save everything up and let's go ahead and submit our page in chrome and so what we're going to do is we're going to fill out the first text box wrong again so we'll only enter three characters like we did in the last video the second text box that'll be false they entered everything correctly let's hit submit we got our alert now if we okay that first textbox should be highlighted red and it is take a look at that and so the user knows right away they have to refill this out correctly and if we hit submit the form is submitted okay that's going to do it for this video
