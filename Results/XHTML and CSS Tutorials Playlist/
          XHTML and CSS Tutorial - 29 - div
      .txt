what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 29th CSS tutorial and this tutorial is going to be amazing because we're going to be talking about my favorite part of CSS and that is called the div element now before you might have noticed if you try to make a cool-looking webpage that what we know so far we can't really get a cool layout with our web page maybe you tried using tables but that didn't really work out it looked like an old web page I mean if we just put like a heading and an image and then a paragraph everything kind of looks like it's stacked on top of each other and it reminds you of like the old 1990s websites where everything was just like plain and stupid and it wasn't a good layout look more of like a outline for English class than the layout so here is what I'm going to introduce to you guys in this tutorial an element called div short for division long for the now it's not long for dubba anyways what it means is a div element pretty much gives you the ability to define sections on your web page to place elements exactly where you want them so for example if you want an image in the top right and then um maybe a heading in the bottom left and maybe some paragraphs somewhere in the middle you can position them exactly how you want them using the div element so now everything just doesn't have to go paragraph under a heading under an image under another heading nothing has to be stacked on top of each other anymore it could be laid out to the left right side by side if you want so anyways enough of me talking let's get and let me show you guys this div in action so let's go ahead and put some text on the screen just put some my name is Bucky that's good enough nothing too big I don't want to waste my time type in a worthless text so anyways go ahead and surround it with these tags div and yes you have to use those exact letters and div so now the text my name is Bucky it's surrounded in tags right here so what exactly can we do with div tags well if we go up here in our CSS interactive and in our properties or curly braces whatever you want to come go ahead and start adding properties to it first of all let's go ahead and make it easy to see so let's give it a like a solid red border so border two pixels solid red if you guys can't see that then you are blind so now I'm going to teach guys about something called positioning but actually just go ahead and do this position app salute now positioning is like a whole another tutorial so I'm just going to skip over this for now but it's crucial that if you want to follow along then your right position equals absolute but again arm don't worry about position right now because I'm going to be covering that in like two or three tutorials but for now let's just stick with div and focus on this so anyways like I said a div is pretty much a section of your website so what we can do to give this box yeah that's a better term for a box when what we can do is first give this box a width so go ahead and set the width equal to 300 pixels and now what we can do is check it out let's go ahead and save it so we see what we're working with first go ahead and refresh the screen and we now have a box on our screen now the text is inside the box aka the div and also the box has a border of two pixels it's solid and it's red person all right Bucky you told me that I can position this anywhere I want on the screen it doesn't have to be stuck in the top-left corner well let's go ahead and change that right now in order to change the position of this box the only thing you need our coordinates now here is the top of your browser right here and here's the left-hand side so say you want to move it down 40 pixels so be somewhere right here and left 35 pixels so it'll be like the top left will be somewhere right here so let's go ahead and do that by adding the properties top and go ahead and make this forty pixels and also set left equal to 35 pixels and a lot of people get this confused easy whenever you save it and refresh it you see that it moved down 40 pixels and it moved to the right 40 pixels whenever you say top 40 pixels you're saying the top left corner you want to be 40 pixels down right here not like the middle some people might think all right a middle point would be a good point to move around but it's actually the top-left corner you're you're focusing on so whenever you say top 40 it says move the top down 40 or in other words 40 pixels from the top and whenever you say left the 35 pixels it says move this corner 35 pixels from the left so now we have our box move down from the top 40 pixels and move down org ship excuse me moved over from the left 35 pixels so pretty easy to understand and now you can see by using those coordinates we can move this box around the screen any where we want so this is a lot better way of positioning our elements around on the screen then just before or maybe if you tried using a table don't ever do that because it just doesn't work this is the new and improved way of how to use CSS to position elements so later on when we're making an entire website and say maybe we want our logo in the top left and maybe an ad on the top right and a navigation bar across the top and maybe some more navigation on the Left we use a bunch of different divs in order to make a bunch of different boxes that we can put stuff in so anyways I'm going to be teaching you guys about positioning and how to make different types of divs in upcoming tutorials so don't forget to check those out so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and yeah I guess I'll see you next video
