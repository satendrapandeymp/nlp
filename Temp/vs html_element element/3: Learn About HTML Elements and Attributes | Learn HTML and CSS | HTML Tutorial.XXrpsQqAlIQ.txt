in the last episode we learned how to set up new project one one to create a website and we also learn how to create a new page inside the website so in this episode I'd like to talk a bit more about the tags to create it in the previous episode and the different types of text we have inside HTML so when it comes to tags inside HTML we also call these HTML elements and when it comes to elements we have two different types we have regular HTML elements and then we also have empty elements now in the previous episode we talked about opening and closing tags and these are in fact the regular HTML elements we have inside HTML in some cases we also have empty elements which attacks it does not have a closing tag like the meta tag we created in the previous episode which has information regarding the characters who want to use inside the website so as you guys can see when it comes to HTML we have text that has opening and closing tags and text that doesn't have closing tags now if you guys were to ask them well how can we tell which ones need and doesn't need a closing tag well it's just one of those things you learn along the way as you start programming HTML and there's not really a way for me to teach you guys which one does need a closing tag before we actually start using them inside our lessons here so in the previous episode we also talked a bit about the different tags to be used inside the front page of a website here which is called index of HTML so as you guys continue the previous episode we created a pair of HTML tags it basically says that all the content goes in between these tags will be part of the HTML document we can actually move this out which is a tip that I recommend for you guys so we can actually see the hierarchy inside the website so whenever we have stuff going inside a pair of text like the HTML tags then we want to move out the content once by clicking tap so we can actually see that this goes in between these two tags here and as you guys can see that actually do the same in the previous episode inside the head tags where we moved out the title tag and the meta tag because they go inside the head tag and just to refresh it for you guys in case you forgot the head tag has information in it that we don't actually visibly see inside the page when we do exit open up the web site inside the browser such as the title of the website which pops up inside the tab at the top we also have meta information which is information regarding the website that we don't actually see inside the website such as which character type we want to use we also have links that go to other documents in case you want to the stylesheet which is actually where we can design all the elements we have inside the body tag down here and the body tag is actually what defines what actually needs to be seen inside the website so all the content we put in between the body tags will in fact pop up inside the website and be visible so as you guys can see words actually go back to the website we do actually have hello world because I wrote it inside the body tag now when it comes to these HTML elements we have quite a few of them inside HTML we're not going to cover all of them in this episode we're just going to cover the ones we have here and then maybe just a cover more distance or got some examples but when it comes to HTML elements we also have something called attributes and we actually used an attribute in the previous episode up here inside the meta elements as you guys can see we included a char set which is equal to some kind of value which means that we have an attribute called char set which is basically just a way to add extra information inside these tags which will then use for different things such as that they want to add extra functionality to this tag here then I can actually go ahead and add extra attributes to it so let's actually go and go down inside the body tag and create another tag called a paragraph tag now a paragraph tag is the proper way for us to actually insert text inside the website so the paragraph tag will create by just writing P and then tap and then as you guys can see we get destroyed cut for the paragraph text inside HTML so inside these tags we can actually go and say something like hello world or this is text or something else and then you could go back inside the browser and refresh the browser you guys can see that the styling or these two design slightly changed when I clicked the refresh button and that's because right now because browser set default styling when it comes to some tanks like the paragraph tags if my teens to design when you insert tags around the content so what we can do is you can actually go back inside the file and I can go inside the paragraph tag at least inside the opening tag and then include a couple attributes if I want to so I can exit go and give it something called the title which is equal to double quotes and then I could say something like this is some websites content then afterwards actually saved this go inside the browser refresh and then hover my mouse cursor on top of the text you guys can see get some text inside a little pop-up that says this is some website content so the attribute tags just simply adds extra information or extra functionality inside the website now to give you guys an example of this let's say I want to style this text I can X go and use something called a style attribute inside the paragraph text I'm going to say style it's equal to Delta quotes then I can actually start creating CSS code inside the style tag here so we want to change the color of the text I can say color call 1 red semicolon save it then go inside my browser so you guys can see that now the text turns red so just to show you guys a couple examples of attributes inside HTML these are some of them that we could actually use and there's quite a few attributes inside HTML but we're just going to go and focus on these two in this episode now so we do actually move on this lesson C will actually talk more about attributes and HTML elements that you will need to use inside a website such as a menu or a title inside your website but we're going to go and talk more about these text if you have a social now so this is basically one to show you guys in this episode in the next episode we're going to talk more about how to insert text inside a website hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time
