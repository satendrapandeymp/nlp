you hi guys welcome to inertia technologies this is a barrage in this video session we'll observe mark you tank ma r qu double e mark Q it is generally a crazy tag because it is moving the text moving images mark Q means a little more interest who are learning mainly HTML environment for you people mark you is very interesting thing so what exactly mark you doing I made already very clearly definition using this tag we can create scrolling text or scrolling image we can do in any direction left to right right to left bottom to top top to bottom as usual it is a paid tag by default nature is right-to-left in any web browser may be speed or other attributes or other characteristics there is a differ from browser to browser but a maximum it is starting right side ending left side now we'll observe some properties means attributes related to HTML HTML mark you tag and mark you tag attributes first one behavior generally behavior means we are typing beh AV a row you are American spelling you need to take commonly 90% students are doing the small mistake is you they are keeping so then it is not responding so try to observe that correctly behavior there is no you American spelling it supports three values one is slide second one scroll third one is the alternate slide start and stop as soon as text touches the margin means the right side starting left side ending means one time all it is doing the action scroll it is a default nature start completely and of one side means right side starting left side it is going to be off see rounding scroll alternate it is a bouncing between right and left left to right so this is behavior related values and BG color BG color background color available color name we can use color code also we can use specifies as background color Direction left side right side up down left left to right right right to left up bottom to top down top to bottom then width height both are available pixels we are going to be specifies width in mark you specify height in mark you and loop how many times my mark you should rotate that is called loop by default one time routed you want number means number you can give loop continuous in limited times loop is equal to loop also we can provide four more times means infinity times scroll amount is a number yes specify speed means speed of the scrolling so these attributes practical implementation one by one in our examples we can see right I am writing simply mark Q tag with attributes welcome to nourish I technologies available and that mark you I am going to add ma RQ you double mark you and mark you available mark you close first initially I am not providing any attribute just refresh on the screen it is starting right side smoothly coming to ending left side is welcome to nourish I technologies after ending the last character their first character will be started now for example going to other web browser I am showing the same thing on Firefox same behavior may be movement a little bit different available and whenever you are coming to browser to browser little variation I want to increase this for your better understanding smoothly traveling and it is a little bit bumping providing no institute is a default nature of the browser right I am applying here by default nature is scroll now applying behavior now behavior is equal to I am giving scroll just I am showing here only scroll because related message means better understanding available to you scroll now the same mark you line I am taking control C control V control V copy paste simply slide behavior and this one also I am changing a slight so better understanding available right alter in it I am providing this text also I am changing as alternate capitulate as I am doing visibility purpose alternate so mark you tagged behavior a tribute three parameters scroll slide alternate now these three parameters how behaving save it run on your web browser correctly you need to observe it definitely will get one idea yes scroll rounding slide one time alternate bouncing between left and right frames once again observe with a keen and you required the behavior of the scroll slide alternate will change the browser same behavior doing or not yes on your Mozilla Firefox yes so you can also try it and observe how it is behaving mark you tagged with three parameters behavior attribute now I am playing bgcolor is equal to color code I am providing hash ff99 zero zero orange same BG color I am taking alternate and I am providing right zero zero in nine nine zero zero that is green color let me refresh yes perfectly scroll slide alternate so perfect color available and slide also you can see now BG color after we need to view another attribute is width height after that I will implement on that one direction direction right to left left to right top to bottom bottom to top now alternate level width and height implementing width is equal to one five zero pixels I'll explain in one video very clearly pixel and percentage I will take one separate session on that height is equal to single or double quotations any one you can use 300 pixels now let me refresh I am providing little bit light green and I am providing five five yes completely available here right so perfect the color code I applied here so now we can see direction I want this one top to bottom or bottom to top left to right any direction so top to bottom means go to attribute level observe and Direction is equal to upper no down down means top to bottom let me apply direction is equal to Direction is equal to so whenever you are applying down that refresh it is coming down so this is different directions so behavior width height direction BG color now next attribute we can observe that is loop available scroll amount available for example slide by default rotating one time only now I want more times now direction I am removing height and width also for better understanding you guys just refresh now slide one time I am applying on slide loop is equal to five times save it come back and observe slide one time and it is rotating second time now third completing fourth is started already then finally fifth now it will stop so this is a simple slide we are going to rotate limited number of times I want to infinity times loop is equal to loops and browser supports if not will implement the scripting there scroll amount is there finally the speed and I am coming to first scroll level scroll amount is equal to 1 is a dead slow now will see practically observe scroll slowly coming from right to left because column mode I provided one by default to scroll amount 10 to 15 there is a variation browser to browser now scroll amount to attribute I want to apply slide level already loop I provided 5 scroll amount I am saying just to 1 5 will see the speed observe 1 second time third time fourth to fifth so this is scroll amount again the same scroll amount will observe on alternate level with a little bit more now applying this is 35 I provided now refresh that scroll amount to one and next one is 15 next one is 35 perfectly rotating and that is a loop you provided stop because loop use at five one sometimes whenever we are going to live applications like APSRTC dot in our Indian a lens comm IRS it is like this whenever you are going to websites when you mouse-over the time timings are time details immediate it will stop one moves over it stops once a mouse out automatically scrolling will be start may be top to bottom or bottom to top or left to right or right to left same like that you need to stop here we need to work on that just simply JavaScript implementation required on mouse-over is equal to this dot stop what is this related information although you are having added good otherwise in Java C Class L explained this always representing current object current control now on Mouse out on Mouse out is equal to this dot start once mouse cursor out differently mouse over you can stop Mouse out start like that JavaScript events I applied here just to show you how effectively my mark you tagged is working to show you write refresh that just try to mouse over Mouse out mouse over mouse out not only that you can press button down on Mouse down or mouse up also this is a number of events available on Mouse down equal to this dot stop on Mouse up equal to this dot start and now I am refreshing just slide starting button you can press leave the mouse button press leave like this different kind of actions we can do using mark you tag attributes using JavaScript events perfectly we can do that recently implemented a number of examples on mark you type but mark you tagged using cascading stylesheets more effectively it is working and this much unable to write just I am showing to you because copy/paste only completely one line we can write in remind lines copy-paste just if i am going to change the color more effectively first a low color level I'll show you see that I created some kind of screen service type means using mark you tack CSS JavaScript we can develop even screen servers also but the color is little bit effectively you want to see means simple I'm changing that effectively we can change it for example we required I am saving and refreshing like this effectively we can so this is completely regarding mark you tack try it mark you with images also we can able to work out whenever we are working with age attack definitely mark you with images also I'll show you after this mark you tagged there is a note point also we need to remember it is related to HTML 4 and 4.01 but it is not that much recommended in HTML 5 environment w3c not recommending mark you because in css3 animations already added transitions available transforms available using those features same actions we can do so right now in the market that is more demand compared to mark you tag right next to tag we can see and just HTML header section title I am showing to you pre tag pre means a pre-formatted text title close had a close common body also close HT I am typing body inside what is a pre tag first of all performing another page whatever you typed on the notepad same thing you want to display on the web page that we can do with the help of pre-formatted text spaces return Keys taps any kind of empty characters everything we can show with the help of PR e pre pre popularly known as XMP old name is XMP renamed as or replaced with PR e pre tag now I am writing here welcome to after two enters I am writing nourish I to tabs I am providing technologies and enter IES see like this I provided how I provided also you can observe welcome to again to return key centers and again I press here nourish I - taps technologies of spelling or spelling here now if you save and run on your web browser neatly visible except one space here now but what you entered on the notepad same thing is not visible on the webpage any page you can observe in that situation whatever you entered same thing you require means we are using XMP & XMP also paid attack refresh perfect visibility in the notepad how you type at the same manner on the web page visibility available so this XMP recently renamed as p r e pre pre formatted text same output refresh nothing changes just there is a little margin padding just applied yes definitely because latest all front-end technologies or responsive related features by default adding some kind of features like that added so PR you pre here also will execute so this is whatever the notepad text available same thing on ever page that is a pre formatted text thank you for watching my videos catch me for more videos on youtube.com slash nourish IT
