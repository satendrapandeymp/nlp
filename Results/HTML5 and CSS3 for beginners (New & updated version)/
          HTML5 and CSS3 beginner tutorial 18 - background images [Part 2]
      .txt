hey YouTube welcome back to tutorial number 18 and in this video we are gonna continue looking at background images because last tutorial went on for quite some time but yeah I this is exactly where we left off I had a background image in the body of my website and I also had a background color on my paragraph so I want to show you guys now by the way this is the e CSS for the tutorial I want to show you guys now how to use the background shorthand property because we've taken a look at using background size background image background color background repeat' all individually right and we can use them all individually it's just a little bit annoying and so sometimes you might want to use the shorthand version of this which if I pull up my notes and I copy/paste this across here the shorthand property is simply just using background and then placing all the values in in the correct places but if you're gonna use the shorthand property you have to learn this right now this look looks confusing at first right but this is background so that's the property then we need to remember color goes first image goes second position and size goes third and fourth whether you want it to repeat or not that's v BG origin and BG clip we don't actually use all that much so you know you can get by without those and I'd also say initial or inherit again something that we don't really need to worry about all that much we don't need to use a little too much BG attachment though this is something I haven't talked to you guys about and I should probably mention or spend a few moments talking about this as well but basically background attachment just lets you determine whether your background should be fixed when you scroll or whether it should scroll with the background so yeah pretty much self-explanatory those are the two values fixed and scroll but I'll spend a few minutes talking about that towards the end of the video so let's take a look at using this background shortcut now if I jump back over to the browser here well I haven't actually saved this text in the text of it so let's save this come back over to the text editor and hit refresh okay so right now we've got a blank body nothing's in or on it and let's style this body with the background property so I'm first gonna give it a color of black and if I save this and come back over to the browser and hit refresh you can see that the body now changes to have a black background okay I can also add in my background image let's go URL and put in my image name so selfie dot jpg please make sure you use the correct file extension this is something that already in my images tutorial a few tutorials ago there are people messaging me and telling me that they've had some mistake somewhere along the line and it's always got to do with using the incorrect file extension so just make sure you use the correct file extension okay save this now come back over to the browser and hit refresh and now you can see I'm using my selfie picture in the background but my picture is overlapping the color so we've got a color behind the picture and that's why we can't actually see a black back anymore but if I had transparency on my picture or let's say I set my picture to no repeat then I should definitely be able to see the background right so wherever the picture isn't now I can see that the background is black let's go back yeah so we're gonna repeat just remember if I want to set a size or a position I need to put that over here before no-repeat so let's say position I haven't actually talked to you guys about this either but position has a bunch of different values so we can have Center which will put our background image in the center of our content and you'll notice that right now you'd expect it to be here somewhere in the center of the browser but it's only going to the center of where our content is so because I've only got one paragraph and that paragraph ends here that's where my picture is it sends it in the middle of the browser here and in the middle of our content here so if I add I forget back my my text editor and I just add a bunch of these so that it goes you know all the way down the page you can see now my picture is in the middle of the content further down which doesn't really make sense when it's a small image like this but let's say I change this to the large background so background - Lodge and I come back over to the browser that is my email client okay so let's go back over to the browser and hit refresh okay so now we've got the image back there and it is in the center so that makes more sense right but now I also need to set a background size because we've got it set to center and by the way this could also be left it could be right it could be right Center is it right center or right-center something like that there are a bunch of different values you can play around with those and see where the image pops up on the screen but I'm gonna set this equal to Center and then I also want to set a size of cover so let's save this and come back to the browser hit refresh okay and cover if you guys remember from the previous tutorial it just makes my image fit the actual width of the screen right so there we go it fits the screen and if I scroll it scrolls with my image you'll notice how okay I have to do it on a smaller browser or a smaller size browser but as I scroll the picture goes up with the screen so that is where the next property comes in or the last property which is background attachment so you can set this equal to fixed which means if I jump back over to the browser now and I hit refresh if I scroll the image and the background is not moving you can see that it's very clearly not moving but if I set this to scroll which is the default value then if I jump back over the browser refresh and now I scroll the image is going with the content so you can watch with this orange as it goes up and down with the content so that is the difference between having a fixed background and a scrolling background and that is also how to use the background shorthand property I hope that this tutorial was informative and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS the and UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now why you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me out on patreon you can also check me out on social media I will leave the links next to me so go ahead and click on something and I'll see you guys next time
