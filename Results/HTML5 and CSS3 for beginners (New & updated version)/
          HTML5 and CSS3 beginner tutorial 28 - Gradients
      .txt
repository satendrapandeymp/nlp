hey YouTube how's it going is Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 28 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to create gradients in HTML so go over to your text editor and right now I'm starting my index file off which is this basic template that we've always been using there is nothing in the body then in main CSS this is my CSS file there's nothing here and so of course if we look at this in the browser it is blank so what I want to do is create a div so let's start off by creating this div I'm going to give this div a class of grad which stands for gradient I'm just going to save it like this so now we have a div on our page and I'm going to leave it completely empty now in order to make that div visible in the browser I'm just going to give it a few o'clock a few styling rules some a select a class of grad and I'm going to give the div a height of 300 pixels a width of 100% and I'm going to give it a background color of red so now we have a big red div on the page and what I'd like to do so the only reason why the only reason why I put these styling rules yet is basically so that we can see it because if I didn't put these filing rules here we wouldn't be able to see the div all right so now that we can actually see it let's go ahead and add another attribute which is also background and this attribute will overwrite this attribute okay so the second background attribute will background styling rule is going to add our gradient so let's type in linear gradient and I'm going to open up some parentheses and I'm going to end that off with a semicolon and inside of these parentheses we can add in a bunch of attributes the first one would be the [Music] and then the next one's our colors and we can have a number of colors so you don't have to only have one color you could I mean ID you want at least two but you could just have you know up to as many as you like I mean I don't I'm not sure if there is a limit or not but somebody would have to google that and find out and leave it in the comment right I don't think you're going to be using more than like five or six anyway but yeah basically just add in a direction where you want the gradient to go if you don't add a direction it's usually going to go from top to bottom but a direction would be to write or to left and that will change the direction of the gradient right then let's just work with two colors for now so you can make one side of your gift red and then it can fade into another color which I'm going to just use yellow right so it saves this now come back to the browser and hit refresh and you can see we've got red fading into yellow and this is going from from left to right and that was our direction to the right we can also change this to left and then what it'll do is it'll start red on the right and fade in to the left and we can change the direction up as well so it can be too tough which will start at the bottom and go up or it can be to bottom and of course then it starts at the let's say to bottom yeah okay to bottom so it starts at the top and it fades its way down into yellow at the bottom right so yeah that is how you change the directions of gradients and how you can pick colors so you can pick red or yellow as like preset colors but you can also use RGB values like I don't know 30 you thirty thirty and that's going to be like a light gray and then you can you know mix it so you don't have to use RGB over here I mean we could use whatever you texted decimal colors and go ef ef ef so it doesn't really matter how you pick your color like it can be a wording color like a preset color or it can be an RGB value or it can be a hexadecimal value as long as it's a color and your gradient will work so now we're going from like a dark grey into like a very light gray right so that is how you pick your colors and like I said you can have a lot of multiple colors right so let's make this fade in to the right and let's use a number of colors here so I'm going to start off with red then we can fade it into orange and then we can fade it into yellow then we can fade it into blue then we can fade it into indigo then we can fade it into violet so these are all preset colors that come in CSS and if we save this and come back over to the browser and hit refresh hey we have a rainbow although I think I kind of missed green so that should be somewhere over there hi and if we add green in it looks more like a rainbow awesome yeah that's how you make a rainbow with gradients and gradients can be linear but they can also be radial so if we change this to radial and then our direction has to change because it can't be to the right or to the left anymore but let's just use radial gradients with all these colors and see what happens nothing and I believe that that might be because we can't use so many colors or something or it might because I felt radial wrong okay it's a radio yeah okay not radial okay refresh there we go so now we've got violet blue green yellow orange and red in a radial gradient so it's a circular gradient right let's get rid of all these colors because it does look a bit confusing when there's a lot and instead let's just work with two come on yellow red and yellow as our colors great so now we've got red and yellow okay so that's how you play around with gradients there's a lot more stuff you can do with them like in fact if we change this back to a linear gradient and we made this fade from RGB a of zero zero zero zero this should give us a transparent color so we can make transparent or see-through color fade into an actual color so in this case we can make it say from transparent interior let's try and read it just because that's probably gonna be the easiest to see and now we've got it transparent at the top and it sort of slowly fades into red as it goes so if you make a go to the right as well maybe we can see that a little bit more clearly but it's like almost completely clear here and then it fades into red as we get to the end and there are a number of different things you can do with this so like I said you can use a lot of different colors you can use radial gradients or linear gradients you can even adjust where the gradient starts and ends if it repeats and all of that kind of stuff is going to be a little bit extra because you add percentages values into here and if you're interested in learning how to do that basically you know just go ahead and check how Google and I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within two of weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that while you're still here there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
