hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 24 and in this tutorial I am going to talk to you guys about pseudo classes in CSS and if you guys are wondering if the text or something looks different it is actually I've changed a little bit basically I started recording my screen at a higher resolution so I could try and have the videos available in 720p and then the text was actually really small it was like that so I decided just to zoom in a little bit and as you can see it kind of makes things look a little bit more bold than they would actually normally be okay so that's just why the writing would look different okay so let's talk about pseudo glasses and a pseudo class in CSS is basically just there to give you guys a little bit more control over your styling okay this it like they are all built into CSS so you can't go ahead and make your own pseudo class but you can choose from a bunch of pre-made pseudo classes that I am going to show you guys and I probably won't show you all of them so you can go ahead and actually Google some of it and see if you can find out if there's anything that you need that is going to be useful over there okay and one of the first pseudo classes that I want to show you guys is called first letter so let's go ahead and actually make a few paragraphs here I'm going to go ahead and actually just type that out once then I'm going to put my cursor in front of the paragraph tags push ctrl D and that duplicates it so I'm going to make four paragraphs and I'm actually stealing this idea from my original tutorial on pseudo classes so I'm going to type the word u and then only and then I'm going to get the next paragraph to say live and the last paragraph is going to save once so Yolo and now we can go ahead and actually style the first letter of every single one of these paragraphs using a pseudo class and then we'll be able to make the actual word Yolo stand out so let's go ahead and do that and the way you use a pseudo class is basically by selecting whichever element you want to change so in this case it's going to be the P element and then you have to append on or add on a little bit of extra information which is the pseudo class that you are choosing to use so like I said there is one called first letter so you're going to append on this colon and then you're going to type first letter and in fact it should be hyphenated just like that so the first letter of every single one of our paragraphs that's basically what that pseudo class is selecting and now we can go ahead and just maybe change the color of that to let's go ahead and change it to blue and we'll make the font weight bolded so font-weight:bold and we'll change the font size to something quite big so let's just change the font size to maybe 20 pixels okay so now when I go ahead and save this and whoops EE you can see I've been on YouTube I'll go ahead and save that and just run this in Firefox you can see I now have you only live once print it out and ready just go in and zoom in to make that look a little bit the same size as the rest of the text okay so that is the first letter pseudo-class we also have something called the first line pseudo class so if I go back over to a notepad plus plus and let's just take all of that out over here and add in a new paragraph and we're going to have to make it quite long so we'll just say the quick red fox jumped over the lazy Brown dogs back back not bagged and I think I'm going to have to just duplicate this a few times just to make sure that it takes up quite a bit of space okay cool and that should be fine so let's go over to your notepad plus plus again I don't know how I change to the browser but anyways notepad plus plus and instead of working with the first letter class let's work with the first line and I think this is fine I think we'll just keep the color blue font-weight:bold and the size of 20 pixels and what this is going to do is change the entire font size font weight and color of our first line in the paragraph so basically you can see here we've got quite a few lines that are actually displaying but only the first line of the paragraph or the top line of the paragraph has changed okay and I guess if I made my browser narrower anything that falls down to the next line changes back to black which is that's cool so that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
