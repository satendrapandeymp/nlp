hey this is Sasha and in this video what I want to share with you is the tools and resources that you're going to need in order to build a basic website or go through these tutorial lessons when it comes to HTML and you're not going to need a ton of tools but you will need just a handful of tools and all of them are actually absolutely free so besides having your web browser you will also need something like notepad or a text file editor or even sublime text now this is what I'm going to be using as it's sublime text you'll need FileZilla which is an FTP program File Transfer Protocol program that's only if you're uploading things to the web you're not gonna really need that per se as we go through some of these initial training videos you could just do it right in your browser on your local computer and then of course you will need your browser but as you get more into this you'll probably want some more advanced tools like sublime text and FileZilla and some browser extensions so if we take a look here at a notepad you know you can write basic HTML code right here and as you get into writing this code the only downside with notepad is it doesn't color correct things there's a lot less features it's a stripped-down versions but you could you know save it now when you do go and save this notepad file you could save it as a dot HTML or a dot HTM or dot PHP file so you could save it as one of those extensions but you know for our purposes if we use sublime text it just makes things a lot easier not to mention the white strength of the notepad is just after looking at it for hours it just hurts your eyes so it's usually that's why one of the reasons why stockbrokers or even coders they use something with a dark background it just not as astray Gnaeus on the eyes so I personally like using sublime text and if you go to sublime text it is absolutely free and what you can do is click it and it'll look something like this there are others of course but there's a lot of advantages to sublime text and you'll see as we go through this tutorial of course you could just manual type things in but it does give you a lot of beneficials to speed processing some things in either case by all means you can use this or notepad as we go through the lessons i'll be using sublime text but you can see as you write things you can definitely make things a lot quicker so you can just go here and download this the other tool is FileZilla and it's not FileZilla comm but if you search for FileZilla you'll see it's FileZilla - project org so when you go there it's a free FTP solution this is when we start transferring files to the web server you might want to take a look at that and then of course for the browser I'm just going to be using Google Chrome right here there's some browser extensions that you may want to get like a browser with chrome extension which will allow you to set a width of a browser simply because when you're testing CSS code in the future that might be handy for our purposes in these training lessons we won't need it and then also an auto refresh so if you have a second monitor or a third monitor this is really handy because what you could do is code let's say on this screen save the file and then loop this auto refresh every 15 seconds so that way on your other screen or other monitor it's constantly refreshing periodically every so many seconds and that way you can see the new results so ultimately those things are handy for workflow purposes but again not as necessary so that's all you really need we're gonna get into sublime text right here and this is what we'll be using when I start up at this sublime text it may look slightly different and that is simply because just the way that I have it configured you know if I go to the configuration files and you go into my settings I'll just show you those settings so you can just take a quick peek at my settings it's not anything advanced or extreme but here are my basic settings if you want to take a look and make some of those changes I also have let's see here on key bindings I have a few key bindings which means if I do control B it changes the Tagg into strong if I do control one it'll do h1 h2 and these are just some tags that we get into but of course there's other key bindings that you could do so anyways um you can customize those things but of course you could manually just type anything that we do in here one last point I want to make is towards the lower right over here if you take a look at sublime text you'll notice there's an HTML little area right there and if I go ahead and click on that you could change it to PHP color code you could change it to HTML we're gonna be mostly working in HTML and that way just color codes things as we type out the code so as we type in let's just say HTML right here you can see there's some code that's being color coded and as I get into some more color coding and you can see how quickly this starts to work out with sublime text in either case and I type in let's say google.com you can see how it's color coding things and that's one of the advantages to sublime text so in either case we're going to use the HTML color coding as far as some spacing goes but again totally up to you what you use if you change it to I think Emmet it'll change it a little bit differently if you change it to PHP it might change it a little differently but overall you know having some nice color code helps you just read the code a lot easier so other than that that's all you really need as far as writing a website writing some code you just need a basic text editor you need a browser to preview it and that's it if you're looking to upload files to the web in that case you need an FTP program like FileZilla or in fact there's packages and preferences within sublime text but that is beyond the scope of this presentation simply because that's more detailed for setup and configuration for sublime text which I may do another training video on at some time in the future but for our purposes this is all you need to get started so check out some of the resources I'm gonna mention under this video or on the website so go ahead pick up these tools install them or you could just use something like notepad and open up your browser and that's all you need thanks for joining me in this training video go ahead hit play on the next video and let's continue learning together now don't forget to sign up to my newsletter list so that way you're notified as I launch new live classes or business training videos so go ahead click here and sign up to the newsletter by entering your name and email address when you get on that page and you can also get some free goodies as things get released thanks again and I hope to see you in the next lesson
