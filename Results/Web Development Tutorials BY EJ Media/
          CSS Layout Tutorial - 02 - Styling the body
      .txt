welcome to the second tutorial on CSS layouts so we're going to get started in this video now the first thing I want you to do as I did in the previous CSS and HTML series I would like you to create a website folder and then I want you to create a index.html and also a style sheet and remember when you're in notepad remember to save as all files and you will save it as a style sheet and this re exists so I'm going to save it fine and the same thing with this you're going to save this as an HTM or HTML so you go to save as you don't want to select the dot txt you want all files and then that will give you a index.html and a style sheet CSS so as you can see I already have the standard HTML document here and of course we are going to point to our style sheet within our folder now the first section that we are going to style is the body section and what we're going to do in terms of this layout is we're going to start in a top down order so the body gets rendered first so that's what we're going to style first and you will remember that the body encompasses the entire web page so every other element that we put in here is a child element all the content sections that we're going to do the sidebar sections they will all be child elements under the body section so what do we want first well I always like to start out with a nice background color so let's go ahead and put that into our body and you'll remember that the property is background - color and I've got a hex code all ready to go and that is 9 c9 fox8 for all right and so let's go ahead and save this and let's open up our page and there you can see we've got a nice background color now that encompasses the entire webpage because this is of course the body section that we are dealing with now I want to point out that you can pick the colors that you want so if you want a different color here by no means you have to use the colors that I am using I just sort of selected these but you can use any color scheme that you want if you intend to use this layout for a website and one good way to do color matching is go out to Google and you can type in website color matching and there are any number of websites out there that will help you match colors so again this is our background color and what we're going to do is we're going to place all of our child elements over this and we will actually use this color actually for some other purposes and I will show you that in a few videos so let's close this out so we've got our background color and remember everything that's put within the body rule set is inherited by all the child elements that we put in the body so for instance if I create a main content section and I don't put in a color in there it's going to inherit it from the body now we're going to override that we're going to put different colors in the main content sections but if we didn't it would get this army green that I have here so just keep that in mind this is really just a background color that we want for the entire webpage now we also want to set the margin to zero now you will remember the browser by default puts in that extra margin space and we don't want that in this web layout we're doing so we're going to just override that and set that to zero pixels so that will eliminate all the extra margin space that the browser tries to create on the edges so let's go ahead and save that there's nothing really to see there if we load this you won't really see anything because we don't have any other elements in here yet but we would notice it if we had a bunch of elements in here so let's just go ahead and close that out next we're going to set a font that we want to use throughout our web page and I already typed this out so I'm just going to copy and paste it um the first one that will get loaded is for Donna and if the web browser can't locate that font it will load Georgia and if it can't load that font it will load serif' now verdana and Georgia are two of my favorite fonts actually I'd like Georgia a lot too um but again you can pick the fonts that you like you may want aerial or Helvetica you know you may have some other font again it's what you want I'm just I'm just giving you the layout but again you can pick the fonts that you want to load so this is a good way to set up some nice inheritance because every child element that we put out there now all the content panes that we do will automatically put the Verdana font out there in those child elements we don't have to do it now because we set it up here in the body section so that it could be an heritage later so again this is always good practice to set your fonts first in the body rule set okay so let's move on now we want to set the font default size that we want throughout the webpage and in this case I'm going to set this to 14 pixels now again you can set this to what you want you may just want to use the key word remember we talked about that in the CSS series you can put small medium or large now most websites will use small or medium and this 14 pixels equals of the smaller pixel size but remember we can expand this out through percentages in the child elements that we put in the body and I'll show you that in a few videos and we did that in the last series as well and we're going to do that again here so again we're just setting the default font size that we want throughout the website at 14 pixels and so let's save this and again if we open this up we're not going to see much at this point but yeah there's not much there all we have is the color but but these properties will become more relevant in the next several videos okay so that's going to do it for the first video then the next video we will create the header and the navigation bars see you guys then
