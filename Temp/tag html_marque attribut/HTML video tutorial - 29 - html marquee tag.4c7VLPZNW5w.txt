mark you tag here in the body I am going to write ma r qu ee mark you text i have written some text here file save go to browser refresh you can see that mark you text God displayed in the browser I am going to add mark cute tag to it now mark you tag is a paid attack so definitely we will be having one opening tag one closing tag then mark you tag is a block level tag it takes the entire width of the parent tag so let's begin I'm going to add mark um a are qu double e opening tag just before the M after this T I am go red closing ma our cube you double e mark you Dan file save go to browser refresh check this out our text is moving from right to left it is scrolling guys it goes slowly to the left and it comes from other side you can see that right let's discuss more about mark of tag I am going to copy this from here I paste it down we are going to use an attribute called as BG color we can apply the background color for the mark you also you can see the background color is white by default I am going to just say file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have two module text scrolling here I am going to add BG see vuelvo are color and I give the color as maybe cya and sighin file save go to browser refresh check this out for the below mark you text we are having a background color applied this is how you can apply a background color if you want then I copy this paste it down after that I am going to discuss one more attribute that attribute is called as width you can mention the width and height also you can see that the marker is taking complete width of the parent so what I do I say here width is equal to 50% file/save go to browser refresh you can see that this mark you resized to 50% of the browser window and you can see that the marker is scrolling in that area only if you want you can align that to the center if you want to you can align that to the right by using the align attribute but we don't have a align attribute for this if I say here a lig and align equal to c e and ter center then say file save go to browser refresh you can see that it's not aligning if you want to align it to the center or to the left or right you have to enclose this mark you tagged in some other tag which has the align attribute like I can use a paragraph tag I use a paragraph tag opening paragraph tag then I write here a closing paragraph tag file save go to browser refresh we have a mark you tag within the paragraph tag you can see that paragraph tag has added some space above and below the mark you then I am going to say here a li ji and align equal to center file save go to browser refresh you can see that mark you is now aligned to the center if you want you can align it to the right file save go to browser refresh hope you guys have understood how you can align a mark you text to the left right or Center by using the P tag below that I am going to copy this content and paste it down and discuss something more about mark you tag we are going to add few more attributes let's add some more attribute if you want you can mention the width as I mentioned you can also mention the height so I copy this from here I paste it here I mentioned the height yecchh e IG HT height height is 50% for this molecule file/save go to browser refresh you can see that it has took 50% of the browser window and mark you is moving from left to right to left you can observe that you can mention if you want the width as well as height according to your requirement what you want at present I do not want the height so I am going to remove that file save go to browser refresh this is how it looks now we are going to add an attribute called as behavior there is an attribute called as behavior b e:h a VI whoa our behavior equal to by default the behavior is scroll SC AR o Double L scroll and if you see file save go to browser refresh you don't find any change you can see that the mark your text is moving from right to the left slowly right it's moving no problem let's see what happens if I change from scroll to slide SL IDE slide file save go to browser refresh now what slide does means it moves the content from right towards left and it stops there you can see on the left it stops this is sliding slowly it is coming and stopping on the left hand side that is sliding behavior scrolling means it will come back again instead of that we have one more attribute one more value for the behavior attribute that is alternate alt er na te alternate file save go to browser refresh what alternate does it moves the content from right to left left to right you can see that so it bounces back again it hits to the right side goes to the left this is how the alternate behavior works guys I can copy and put everything step-by-step lets me put it here i can say here as slide then i say here scroll SC arwe double l scroll file save go to browser refresh I can change the background colors if I want for all ye ye ll bow w yellow for this I am going to mention the background color as maybe light blue file save go to browser refresh you can see that the content is clearly visible now how the behavior is working again I add a mark you tag down here paste I add some breaks so I write here break tag I write here also the break tag so that we can get a little bit gap between the mark you tags file save go to browser refresh okay now what I am going to do I am going to discuss about another attribute called as direction so Direction is another attribute here I am going to mention dir ec TI one direction equal to by default Direction is left le ft left file save go to browser refresh left means from right towards left so direction we have given to the market move towards left so the market is moving to the left let's change it to let me copy this again and paste it and here I am going to same instead of left I say in this place right righ T right file save go to browser refresh you can see that this text is moving towards right right we have changed the default behavior let me paste once again and I am going to give the different information here this time I am going to give up file save go to browser refresh what is happening here the mark you text is moving up and down up and down because we have given the alternate behavior if I give it scroll file save go to browser refresh it goes up and comes from the down that is how it works let me give the background color something else instead of a light blue maybe I can give light lig HD light pink we have light pink name file/save go to browser refresh yes you can see that the content is moving up so this is how you can change the direction if you want you can say down Devo W and down file save go to browser refresh you can see that now mark you've tagged is text is moving down right it is scrolling also if you want you can give slide SL ID is slide file save go to browser refresh now what happens it will slide down and it will stop in this place you can use the market tag to move the content according to your requirement on the browser maybe you want continuous movement maybe you want one short movement let me copy this and paste it down and I change the color to red I change this to scroll SC arwe double l scroll and I am going to remove the direction file save go to browser refresh now the market text is moving towards left of course I want to change the text color if I want to change the text color I'm going to use the font tag font then I mention here color equal to WH ite white opening brace before closing the marquee Oh tag I'm going to close the font tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that now the text is in white color you can even move the images if you want to move images also you can move you can use the marquee tag to move my image from right to left and scroll it if you want to move an image up and down you can move the image also instead of the text all you need is you need to use the image tag and mention the image name that's it this is how you can use the marquee tag if you want you can control the speed of movement of the mark you text also I am going to copy this content from here
