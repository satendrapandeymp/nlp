okay so in the last several videos we've talked about selecting elements and how do we get those elements we get them by using these three methods which we've talked about extensively so we can kind of take a break from these methods now we can kind of move on but now we're actually going to start changing content we've changed the CSS styles but now we're actually going to replace content and so how do we do that well we can use that with the inner HTML property which we're going to talk about in this video that's one of the ways that we can actually replace the content itself so we're actually going to use the same exact code we use in the last video but we're going to alter it a little bit what I did here is I just changed this a little bit I just said hit submit for some new text I put in some text here in our first paragraph and I put in some text in our second paragraph and what we want to do is actually completely replace this text so what we want to do is when we hit this button we want this actually to say new text one and we want this to say new text - so let's bounce over to our JavaScript code that we used in the last video and you can see here we're doing exactly what we did in the last video we're using the get elements by class name to get our elements and again we're going by class name we have two elements and then we have to specify the node for each so that's all going to stay the same but we're not going to change the CSS styles now so we're going to get rid of these what we want to do is specify inner HTML here and that allows us to write new content to our paragraph element and this is a property it's not a method it's actually just a property of our object our paragraph object so what we're going to type in here is inner HTML and then we need to assign a value which is going to be our new string that we want to write out and we're going to say new text one and then let's just copy and paste this in here and now we're going to say new text - for our second paragraph and let's go ahead and run this and if we hit the submit button we get our new content which in this case is text so that's what we're doing here we are writing out completely new content using the inner HTML property now in this video we just wrote out the text but there actually is a way just to read the content and we'll do that in the next video see you guys
