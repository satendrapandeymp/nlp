in today's lesson we're going to be taking a look at IDs and classes and these are simply ways that we can assign labels to specific elements so that we can then target them within our style sheets let's look at an example as you can see here I have a blank page with an unordered list with just a bit of gibberish here our goal is we want to make this list item have a color of red so if you want you can pause and see if you can figure out how you would do it now in a previous lesson I showed you how to link to an external stylesheet and this is very important it's the best practice do this in your projects however there's also another way that we can do it and this is referred to as inline CSS and this can be helpful if you have a very small project or let's say you're working on a very tiny demo and you want to send it off sometimes it doesn't make sense to have extra files when it's so small in this case within the head we're going to learn a new element and this is called style now we can add CSS properties within here the same way we would as if it was a style sheet just note within the head of your document wrap everything within a style tag now to give you an example if we set the body and we set the background color of the body element meaning the wrapping body element is going to have a background of red let's try that out and as you would expect the CSS is being applied correctly good so now let's get back to our assignment we need to make this third list item right here red how would you do that well let's try a couple examples first we can search for all list items and we're going to make the color red if i refresh as we would expect every single list item is being applied but in our case we need a way to target this one exclusively now I'm going to show you three different ways that we can do this easy to hardest so the first option is to use an identifier so I will come down to the element that I wish to target and I'm going to add in attribute called ID ID for identification or identifier and now I'm going to give it a name of something that describes what this element is remember with semantics we don't want to be specific and we don't want to say third Li that is a terrible ID because watch what happens as soon as we move it maybe down here now this ID makes no sense because it's the fourth one right so always describe it rather than be specific in this case maybe here we would like to apply emphasis here so this describes it it's an emphasized section well now I can reference any ID within my CSS by doing pound symbol and then the name of the ID so in this case I will copy this and paste it in and then within curly braces I had my styling per usual now we're saying look on the page for an element that has an ID of emphasis let's try it out now and as you would expect only the third element is read because that's all we targeted let's see what would happen if we add another ID here of emphasis as well if i refresh it is going to work but I don't want you to do this this is a bad practice we use IDs to target specific elements they are not intended to group elements together and while a browser will allow you to get away with it it's a very bad practice in the web design community and you shouldn't do it instead we use what's known as classes they are quite similar to IDs but the main difference being we use an ID to target one element we use classes to style a group of elements so for example what about all buttons that's on your website there will be numerous ones if you want them all to receive your button styling it would make sense to apply a class of button to any applicable elements that way we use a class to style groups of elements here I'm going to select ID and I'm going to change it to class now to target a class we don't use the pound sign that's for IDs instead we use a period to reference a class and this time we'll make the color green I refreshed now you can see we're doing it the proper way when you want the group styling you use a class and you create that by using a period at the beginning and that translates in humans speak to find the elements that have a class attribute that is equal to emphasis and style them like so if we come back I told you I would show you three ways but we've only gone over two an important distinction to make is that you don't want to litter your HTML with IDs everywhere so you don't want to apply an ID here and then an ID to every single list item in every element even though it might seem like that would help because then you can target anything you want to it's a bad practice especially when there are multiple ways to target elements without using identifiers some of these are part of css3 which is the next standard for cascading style sheets and the downside is that some of these aren't available in all browsers and this is something you're going to find just because it works in the latest version of Chrome doesn't mean it'll work and maybe Internet Explorer 7 and this is something that's going to make you tear your hair off once you get a little bit further into web design but let's try it this time no ID we're still going to target my and this is the way that I would personally do it I'm going to type li colon and child now within parentheses here we can specify which list item we need to target in this case we want to target the third one so I will type 3 and this time I will make the color orange refresh the page and now without using a specific identifier we were still able to target the third list item let's see what happens when we duplicate this unordered list a few times one more time and now I want you to note it's targeting the third list item for each occurrence so note that we're not saying find the very third list item and that's it we're looking for a list item and then we're finding the enth child of its parent so Lepore list item get its parent and then look for the third child one two three they got that one the next one exact same thing so don't think that you're targeting only one you could be targeting a group now you might be thinking how would we target just this one if we wanted to use this format and we don't want to style any of these other unordered lists well again you have a couple options one you could apply the identifier and we'll just give it an idea of sex for the time being and we could do it like so refresh and now we're targeting it or you could use some more advanced CSS selectors but that's the fun thing about CSS is there's multiple ways to solve any problem in this case there's another way we could do ul first of type and if i refresh you can see we are successfully targeting that first one again without using a selector now if this is getting confusing don't worry there are probably plenty of designers who have never used first of time but if we were to go through this we're saying get all unordered lists then filter them down we only want the first of type meaning the first of the type unordered list so we find the very first one then we add a space and this is where we can further select down and now we're saying within this unordered list look for an Li but the third child so one two three and we target and then we style it orange okay so in this lesson you've learned a little bit about pseudo classes and more importantly you've learned how to use IDs and classes to target elements on the page
