so moving on now with a little bit more of an interesting example we have a little bit more of a complex web page here that I'm creating and the thing that I'm trying to get across here are the concepts of elements and attributes in HTML so when an element is is whenever you have a begin tag and an end tag and you've completed from the begin to the end and you have other stuff inside the tag you've completed an HTML element so this is the head element this is the body element this whole thing actually everything that we see here is the HTML element so sometimes when we're talking about metadata like this we can say no to HTML node or the HTML element so in this case you know we have kind of like a parent-child relationship and as well as a sibling relationship so the HTML is the parent of the whole document and it has two children as the head and it has the body so those two elements are the children of the HTML element and similarly those elements have children of their own so the header has a title child and the body has an h1 a P and an A and we're gonna talk about what all of those things mean in a couple of seconds here so just getting the idea for kind of nesting what we call nesting these elements putting elements inside of other elements and this kind of describes the the geography or you know the topography of the the whole HTML document so you know you're gonna see these two head and body those are pretty much the two primary elements in every HTML document on the head is like all the header information not necessarily stuff that's you know on the screen or showing up on the screen but kind of stuff about the document as you can see kind of the most simple one is oh what's the title of the website and you can see over here on the left you know it says Donny's website up here in the tab so it's not really in the document body but you know the browser says oh well the title is Donny's website so I guess that's what I'm going to name you know this particular tab and the body you know that's kind of the stuff that's the main portion of the document so you know obviously the document body is the main stuff in the document so with these three things inside of the body mean our h1 is a header and in HTML there's kind of these six header tags that are reserved h1 through h6 h1 being the biggest or the most important and h6 being the smallest or the least important so that's why the browser you know I didn't really provide any information other than saying oh this is an h1 element but the browser went ahead and made it real big because you know it said oh this is important therefore I'm going to make it big so the paragraph is like kind of the simplest element in HTML it's just just in text and you know I can separate just to show you kind of why even bother with a paragraph I could say this is another paragraph in a second paragraph in there they notice it'll kind of separate them with a line break it puts them into separate little areas on the screen so it is important information just got you know treated in a certain way by the browser but you know kind of all these are really the same type of elements they they just say begin they have a begin tag and an end tag and nothing really else interesting so with this example I went ahead and included an A which is actually a link but they stands for anchor it's kind of the same thing the reason I wanted to include this one here is because it has an attribute so notice this is the end of I'm sorry that is the closing portion of the begin a tag here we have end a here we have begin a but I didn't close off the beginning tag until right there the reason is because I stuck this attribute in there an attribute is just a name value pair the name of this attribute is href and the value of this attribute is you know the location of google.com so hrf is just you know like a reference an HTTP reference to figure out how to link up with another document somewhere out there on the internet and so basically you you've said yeah I'm creating an anchor I'm creating a link here but I need more information than that I need you know the value of this attribute if you don't give it the value of the href it's not gonna know where to go when you click on it so obviously if I click on my link hopefully it take me to where my href said and it did so if I close my notepad here you can see I'm gonna stretch this out I'm going to right click here and view the page source and it's exactly you know the browser is showing me this is the HTML that I use in order to create this page and it's exactly what we saw in the notepad the color is that it's showing here are make it a little bit more readable in Google Chrome notice the the value of the href attribute is kind of blue and it even has a little mouse over effect so this kind of makes it nice and easier to read um that's kind of you know the idea of elements and attributes and you know as we get a little more complicated it's just important to be able to to easily read this stuff so you know as you're crafting your own HTML make sure you lay it out kind of nice you put you know spaces carriage returns between important elements so that you can see you know easily where one stops the other one starts this is the end of had just be in a body and the children usually you know indent them a little bit just so you can easily see that they're part of the parent element and going forward really we're just gonna start listing a whole bunch of these different elements that exist in HTML and how to use them so now that we understand kind of what element is and what an attribute is we're just gonna start kind of shotgunning through all the different prepackaged elements that HTML provides you and what attributes you have to give them in order to make them more
