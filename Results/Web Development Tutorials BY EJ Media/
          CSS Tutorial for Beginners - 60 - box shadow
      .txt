in the last video we added a text shadow to our text now what if we want to add a shadow to a block element such as a div for that we need to use the Box shadow and the parameters are actually very similar to the text shadow property we talked about in the last video and I'll show you that in a minute so you can see I have a very simple div here and of course this is a block element so that's why we have to use the Box shadow property I've given it a width of 600 pixels a height of 200 pixels and edit a color of blue and we can see it over here so we want to do is add a little shadow to the bottom and to the sides now we don't need to see the HTML anymore so let's go ahead and just resize everything up here and let's give this a lot of room there we go okay good so let's go ahead and put in the box shadow property and you guessed it it's just box shadow and then like I said this is very similar to the text shadow property some of the values are very similar so the first value is for horizontal the second value is for vertical so let's just make this 15 pixels and 15 pixels and let's go ahead and make the shadow orange you'll remember this is where the color goes so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh there you can see we've got a nice little shadow here now similar to the text shadow property we can also blur this as well so let's blur this let's say five pixels so we'll go ahead and save this and there you can see now we've got a little bit of a blur effect going here now unlike the text shadow property the Box shadow property has a fifth value that we can specify and that is called the spread radius and we put that right after the blur value and again we can specify this in pixels so let's say we want to increase the spread by seven pixels let's go ahead and do that and let's take a look and see what happens here and there you can see it increased the size of the shadow so that's how that works now one thing that you can do with the box shadow property is that you can actually add inner shadows now this works usually best with lighter color so let's actually make our background color light gray you could actually make it if you want it stands out very well against that as well and we're going to get rid of all of this and the key word that you want to use to create an inner shadow is in set so that's what we do now rarely do you actually give vertical or horizontal dimensions here so we're just going to leave that at zero pixels we're not going to specify anything there and then we're going to blur this by 15 pixels and obviously since we want this shadow to stand out we want it darker than the background color so let's go ahead and make this black and black is usually a really good one to use when you're trying to cast an inner glow or inner shadow so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh and see how that looks really kind of snapping looks really nice doesn't it so that's how you create an inner shadow or sometimes they refer to it as an inner glow
