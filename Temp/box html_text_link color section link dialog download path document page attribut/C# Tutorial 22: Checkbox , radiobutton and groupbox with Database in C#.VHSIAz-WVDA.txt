hello guys welcome once again in this video I will show you how to use radio button and check boxes with your C sharp windows form application so right now if you are following these videos I have made this app with C sharp in which I can log in and I can save data delete and update data and in here I have employee ID first name last name and age and now I want to add a new field here which enables me to add the gender of the particular person or employee so this task I want to achieve with the help of radio button or text box or checkboxes so I will exit this application and what I am going to do is will take a radio button from my toolbox two radio buttons and I will change its text first so for mail first is for me and second is for female so I want to add two radio buttons and when I click one of the button it will take that field name and it will save into the database so how can I achieve this task I will show you but first of all let's look when you drag and drop your radio button in here how it looks when you run your program so when you select this radio button it selected this and when you select this this one is selected okay and to make it work really good you can enclose your all the related field in a group box so I take a group box and I will resize it first and I will take all my related field in which I am dealing with the database I will put in this group box okay and we resize it and hurry means this group oxy like this and I will rename the text of my group box as glowing info so it looks like this now when I grab a radio button or a checkbox this time I am going to take a checkbox from here and two checkboxes and when I run my program and when I select this male or female only one of them is selected from here and when I select this checkbox one or checkbox - you see both are selected here so if you can close your radio buttons in a group box they are separated from your rest of the forms so that's why I am using the crop box so it's better to use a group box whenever you are using radio buttons or checkboxes okay that's for the group box and now I will write a code to save the fields so I'm going to write a code so whenever when I press the Save button I will enter employee ID name surname and age and when I select the gender either male or female the gender is also selected or saved in my data when I press this Save button okay and they in my database I have created a column called gender so whenever I save a new data the gender of the employee will also come here right so let's go to our application and now just go to the code section of your form go above and you need to declare a global variable called strength have you call it gender because this will contain the gender of the employee so go above and declare this global variable string variable called gender and now select this radio button either male or female and double click it and in here right gender is equal to male so whenever employee click male radio button the male text will go into this string variable once again have you come to my phone and now I will double click this female and once again I will write gender is equal to double quote in okay so basically what this code is doing is whenever you click either male or female it takes the text when if you press female radio button it takes the text female and transfer and do this string variable which we have declared above called gender and if you select male then it will transfer the text male into the string gender and it's global so it can be used anywhere in the program now go to your form once again and select your Save button and the code of this Save button I have shown you in the sixth video with you number sixth I think so if you don't know this code just go to video number six and just see the code from there and you can just copy the code from here also so this is all the code from string to catch block for saving the employee data and in here I'm just going to change or add the gender field also okay so go to your string query where you have declared your query this I have shown you in the video number six and in here I have declared the query as string query is equal to double quote insert into database name dot employee name or table name and in here I have taken employee ID column name column surname column and age column from my database these four columns PID name Sun image now I will add the gender column also in the save query so I will add yeah gender and then values earlier I was passing employee ID text name text surname text and age text and write a comma after the age text and just write single quotes in-between double quotes in between + + + in here right gender okay so whatever you have selected in the radio button it will go there and we will pass this value of gender in the query so the whole query looks like this string query insert into your database name dot table name and then in the bracket write all the column names of your database which you want to insert in and values and this I have shown you in the video number six and I just added the new text variable called gender also here and now when I when you run the program and I have this now and let's see the database I have nine entries for the employees here right now and you see all the gender is null because I have just created this column now I want to add the tenth employee and I will see the gender of the employee comes here or not so let's see employee number ten Mac and his age and he is a male for example so I check male text box and when I saved the data my data is saved I can see the message box and let's check it in the database if it's really there or not so right now it's not there but when I press this refresh button you see my number 10 max Miller 33 and his gender also comes here I will add one more employee for example and any name any age and this time she is a female and I will save it that I saved and when I see it in the database i refresh the database and now the gender is also coming male or female so in this way you can use your radio buttons or combo box not combo box but the checkboxes with your C sharp application same as radio button this checkboxes also works so instead of these radio button you can also use the checkboxes so I hope you have learned something new this time please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
