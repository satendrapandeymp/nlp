hi guys in this video tutorial I will show you how you can download Google font into your computer so then you can use it in Photoshop I was doing a design today and I needed this font called bitter and I couldn't find it anywhere I looked everywhere on the web to find it but I couldn't find anywhere as a TTF format so I found a way how I can download it directly from google fonts now all the google fonts are all open source so you don't have any technical issues I mean like copyright issues with Google phone so you can go ahead download it use it on your Photoshop files or illustrator files and then use them on the website so what you need to do is once you want to find the phone that you are interested in you click here we're saying open font in google fonts and basically here you can customize it and it's going to give you this URL you grab the URL and you paste it into the browser and you can see that for the regular is this link for the voltage this one and for the italic is this one depending on what you interested in in this case I'll just show you the first one but you can do the same with all of them I copy the URL URL again and open a new tab and I place it here and if you see it's downloading the font now the issue is that this is a web font WOFF means web open font face so if I take that one show them find that arm I cannot really install this but what can you do is you can go to website called everything font calm and go racing font conversion and go with saying WOFF to TF to t TF you can exalt it here in your computer so just click the link and then you just have to browse and find the fun that you're interested which in my case was this one and click open and then click convert and just wait a few seconds and now you can see the phone now if you open this and you click you'll be able to install which is pretty cool and now you can open Photoshop and you can design using this font so this was a tutorial I hope was useful if you have any question just let me know in the comments below
