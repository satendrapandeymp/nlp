hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 23 and in this tutorial we are going to continue talking about selectors in CSS and I'm actually going to talk about the child selectors specifically now if you guys don't know what I mean by child selector then basically I mean elements inside of other elements okay so in other words let's say I had a div over here and let me just end this off and then I had a paragraph inside of the stuff so end of this paragraph and we'll just say I'm basically like I have a parent and then outside this div will just say put in another paragraph and this one can just say I don't have a parent div and this one should actually say I have a parent div okay and basically what this means is that this paragraph is a child of this div element because basically this paragraph is inside of that div likewise this paragraph does not have a parent div because it is not inside a div at all okay you basically get the picture like as long as you've got an element inside of another element then that is its parent so this paragraph has a parent which is this div and this div has a parent which is the body and this paragraph has a parent it's the body but it doesn't have a div as a parent okay so now whenever I jump over to CSS and I want to style these paragraphs and I only wanted to style paragraphs inside of the div then I could go ahead and do that using a child select and what I mean by child selector well I don't know why I said that twice but whenever you want to style with a child selector you are going to type in the parents name first so div and then P in this case because our parents is the div and then the child is the paragraph and that's what we actually want to style so if you want to go ahead and style with the child selectors you're going to type the parents name and then the actual element that you want to style so let's go ahead and turn all paragraphs inside of a div read so I'm going to go ahead and type in color red okay and and now that I've done that if I run this in Firefox I should get two paragraphs on the screen there we go so one is red because this has a parent div and this one does not have a parent div so that one did not turn red okay and the nice thing about this is CSS whenever you're styling will take the longer description whenever you're trying to style an element so because this div P is more accurate than if I just styled with a P or with a paragraph tag then it'll still turn all of these paragraphs that are inside of divs red even if I have another styling rule that is set to turn all paragraphs blue okay so let's go back here and when I click refresh you can see that it's turned all the normal paragraphs blue but the paragraphs that we'd still have a div as a parent will still turn red because CSS like I said will choose the more descriptive of name or yeah basically this is more accurate because it has the actual parents name and then the the child's name so you can go ahead and style that way and another thing that I'd like to mention though is if you are ever going to have both of these paragraphs inside of a div so let's say that you were creating another div around this paragraph then both of them now have a parent div okay so that means that if you wanted them to be different colors you're going to have to combine classes or IDs with the actual child elements so let me show you guys how to do that so I'll go ahead and give this one a class of red and I'll give the next one a class of blue so just so that you go to blue and basically now whenever I select class red actually I think I'm going to give this an ID of blue just to demonstrate that you can do it with both ID and class so whenever you want to select children with a class then you can go ahead and select your class of red then select the elements that you want to style so basically all paragraphs that have a parent with the class red will turn red and what do you know over here we have a paragraph and it's got a parent div that has the class red so this one should still stay red and now that I think about it if I go and refresh nothing's actually going to change so let's give this next class or next ID a class of Yi green rather just so that we actually get the to change okay and basically if you want to select with parents and children or IDs with children with IDs as parents there we go that's probably the better explanation then you could go ahead and just go hashtag and then put in the ID so the ID was green and then select your child element that you would like to style which in this case is our paragraph and now all paragraphs that have a parent with the ID of green should turn green so let's go ahead and just change that okay and well you know the second paragraph over here has a div with a parent out or has a parent --iv with the ID of green so now when I hit go ahead and click refresh I get my paragraph turning green okay so that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this tutorial don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and
