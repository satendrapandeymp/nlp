for today if you're training you're not going to be learning from me specifically you're going to put some of what you learned to the test in your first quiz so you should be able to refer to each previous lesson in this series to figure out how to do each section this is what you're going to be building a very very simple website but it will test your knowledge of some of the HTML elements that we've learned here so I'm not going to give you any hints here your job is to rebuild this from scratch in your own editor without seeing my source code first but I'll give you a couple tips here when creating your own website and deciding what elements to use it's helpful to describe what each section is so for example we have our body which is this whole window here and it looks like it has a different background color and then we have a top level heading here and then we have just a little bit that describes our website a paragraph and then we have a list of some things that I enjoy and then we have a subheading here of some quotes with just some gibberish quotes here and it looks like within our quote they're styled just a little bit differently it looks like the text is centered and there's a border around our quote so that's your job here if you need to prefer to a previous lesson do so but by tomorrow you'll want to make sure that you have created this on your own so get started
