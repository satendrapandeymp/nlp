today we're going to learn how to insert a footer inside a website and the way we're going to do this is we want to make sure the footer always stays at the bottom of the website so as you guys can see my example here I just have a piece of text inside my content and because of this essentially inside a typical website it would actually end up looking more like this so the photo actually starts right underneath the actual content inside the page so we can actually use CSS no to keep the footer at the bottom of the website like Aven here and as soon as the content becomes so big that it actually reaches the bottom of the page is I just going to start pushing down the footer so the photo is actually not fixed to the bottom of the page it will in fact move as soon as the content reaches the bottom of page so we're going to go to accomplish this fairly easily so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and go inside my text editor now this is what I was talking about this is a very basic let's say a front page that has section inside the body tag and then the footer starts right underneath the section so this would actually make the footer do this so in order to get this other effect here we're going to go and open up a new document so this was just a shirt as an example I'm going to go and close that down and then I'm going to go and open up a new document I'm going to save it inside some kind of folder as index dot HTML then I'm going to go ahead and create a new file save it as style the CSS then inside my index file I'm going to go ahead and include just a basic HTML tag so we need to have inside a website let's say there's actually a front page because we call the index.html and inside of here I'm going to go and link to my stylesheet again you guys do not do this by now so I'm not going to go too much into detail about how to actually link to a style sheet I'm going to say style dot CSS inside my body tags in order to get this effect where the photo stays at the bottom of the page we're going to go and create the div tag now this div tag is going to do is well first of all this would give it some kind of ID I'm going to call this one container you guys can call it something else if you have plans in the future to call other elements inside your website container you can call something else so you don't have to call this specific name now inside the container we're going to go and create another div and in a second I'll explain what exactly we're doing here and why we need to create these divs inside divs so we're going to give this one an ID as main so underneath these I'm going to go and create the footer we're going to have at the bottom of our website like so now I'm also going to go ahead and give this folder a ID which I'm going to set as footer like so so what we did here is basically the first div we have up here called container it's going to be a hundred percent of the height of our browser so right now this container takes out the entire height of the website we're inside of so basically what we're doing is we're saying okay so this one since it 100% height the footer is actually going to jump down below what we're viewing inside the website when we open up the website so we can't actually see the footer when we load the page then the second div we have inside this container is going to be the one that contains all the content of our website so once this div down here becomes so big that actually goes below the height of our browser it's going to start increasing the container div height so it's going to push down the footer even more when we reach to certain Heights and now you might be asking well if we can see the footer when we load the page and it's just going to keep moving down so we can actually see it when we do get more content then how do we actually see the footer let's go ahead and jump into the styling so I can show you guys how to do this so I'm going to go and save the document here I'm going to go inside my stylesheet and the first thing we're going to do is I'm going to go ahead and say we want to style basically everything inside the website because we have some default margins inside our browsers that we need to get rid of I'm going to say we have a margin set to zero then I'm going to do the same for the padding set it to zero like so and then we're going to go to style our HTML and body tags inside our page so we're going to say HTML comma body curly brackets and then we set the height to 100% and the reason we do this is because we can actually set the container ID to 100% Heights if the HTML and the body tech does not have a height as under percent so we can actually detect the height of the browser if we do not do this okay underneath the HTML and body styling we're going to go and style our ID called container which is going to be the one that covers the entire height of our browser so we're going to say we have a height well actually a minimum height like so set to 100% then under the container styling we're going to go down style the main ID so we're going to say ID main boom up the curly brackets then we're going to set a overflow to auto which is something we need not to actually get a scrollbar when we do get much more content inside our page so because we're actually doing this thing with the container up here we need to make sure we actually keep an overflow also inside the main ID then underneath the overflow we're going to go ahead and set up adding butter now this padding bottom is going to be the height of our actual footer so right now we need to decide what kind of height we need to add the footer ass so I'm going to go ahead and say we have the photo set to let's say hundred pixels which I know is quite a lot but just in our case here let's set it to hundred pixels then we're going to go ahead and style the footer at the bottom here so we're going to go and say we have an ID set to footer curly brackets then inside the footer we're going to go and give it some kind of background color so you can actually see what's going on inside the footer so I'm going to say we have a background color consider two black just so we can see it then I'm going to go and set a position:relative then I'm going to go into the height which is going to be a hundred pixels because that's what we decided inside the main styling so we're going to go to say hundred pixels then I'm going to go and set a margin top which is going to be set to a negative that a reason we're doing this is because right now the container is a hundred percent it mean that we do actually get the photo pushed below the view of our brows who want to actually open up the website so we want to get it back inside the view you know at the bottom of the page we need to make sure we move to footer upwards the same amount that the height is of the footer so right now we can set this one to a negative 100 pixels and then we're going to go and give it a clear both at the bottom like so now if we were to go ahead and go back inside my browser and just go ahead and take our index file load it so we can actually see it you guys can see that now we have a footer at the bottom of our website and right now forward to actually insert some content inside our index file that's inside the main div box we have here I'm just going to go and write some text I'm going to say blah blah blah save it refresh the browser and you guys can see that we do have some text in here and the content or at least the footer is still the bottom two website if I were to go ahead and say well let's actually give our main a background color just to illustrate what we're actually doing in here I can say we have a background color as red then you guys can actually see the bottom padding of our main div which right now is 100 pixels plus the text web inside the main container so the reason we decided to get this 100 pixel padding at the bottom is that once would you actually get enough content to make it go to the bottom of the page we need to make sure the content does not disappear underneath the footer which it will do if we do not have this padding here because we move the footer under pixel upwards on top of the content we have inside the browser so we need to make sure we also have a padding inside the you know the wrapper or the main that contains all the content inside our website just to demonstrate this to you guys when I do actually give this main a height set to much more than my browser height the content is going to stay right on top of the footer where the padding here is going to disappear underneath the footer so were to go back inside my styling and say we have a main here I'm going to give it a height just to demonstrate to you 2,000 pixels just to exaggerate a little bit were to refresh the browser so you guys can see want to scroll down right click my browser and inspect it so you guys can actually see the padding the sexy move out of device view if we were to hover inside my ID main you guys can see that the content inside of here does have a bluish tint and then the footer has a greenish tint meaning that the padding inside the main ID is inside the footer so if we were to have content that went all the way down to the bottom is not going to jump underneath the footer which is why we need to have this padding so hope this gave you guys some kind of about why we need to style it the way we do and you know just doing it this way will accomplish this effect that you guys want to have inside your website so I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time you
