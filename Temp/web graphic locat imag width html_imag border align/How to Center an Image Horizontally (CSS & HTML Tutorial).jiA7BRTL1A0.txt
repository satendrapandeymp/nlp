hello everyone welcome to another CSS tutorial in today's video we're going to be taking a look at how to center align an image horizontally this is a fairly basic topic however if it's something that you've never done before it can be a bit confusing and I've had several requests to cover this in a video so let's dive right in on the right side of your screen we see a sample web page with a photo of a cat and then a block of text and our goal is to Center align this image horizontally so it would sit right about here now we have two primary options at our disposal so let's dive into option one on the left side of your screen we see the code that makes up this web page on the right here is our image element cat JPEG okay so some of you may be familiar with this attribute line and then you can assign it a value of left and that will float the image to the left you can also use right and that will float the image to the right so some people think that okay naturally can I just say align Center and we see that that does not work so just try to erase that from your memory that is not possible that will not work okay so what will work and this is option one is to say text align Center on one of the containing elements of the image so if we refresh we see that okay that aligned it's Center but you're thinking I don't want everything on my page to be Center so this text I don't want the center line that's ugly okay so let's get rid of this so realistically your option is to wrap the image in another element in this case we'll use a div and then simply tell that div to be text-align:center okay so that's simple enough and that's option 1 text-align:center on a containing element that houses the image okay so that was option 1 let's move on to option 2 to get the image centered so let's remove this this recently added code okay so we're right back to where we start at the beginning this video option number two is to make the image a block level element so image display:block and now that it's a block level element we can do things with margin so you cannot probably already guess where this is going we're going to assign it a bit of left margin to try to Center it right so let's say margin left 20 pixels okay so we see that that did not push it out far enough and actually that's not what we're going to do I just wanted to show you the general line of thinking we're using there's actually a magical command that will push it out just far enough give it just enough of a margin to Center it perfectly okay and that is margin and you can assign it for values and it goes like the first values top goes in a clock clockwise fashion second value is right third values bottom and this value is left right so if we said zero on top auto on right zero margin on bottom an auto margin on the left we see that that works okay and you can actually make this a little bit simpler and just say zero Auto and the shorthand works in a way where zero is the top and bottom values and the second value works as the horizontal values so it's as simple as margin equals zero Auto and that will centre align the image as long as it is a block level element so that's option two so you now have two options at your disposal to Center align and image horizontally and that's going to bring this video to a close I hope you feel like you learn something thank you for watching and I'll see you guys soon thanks bye
