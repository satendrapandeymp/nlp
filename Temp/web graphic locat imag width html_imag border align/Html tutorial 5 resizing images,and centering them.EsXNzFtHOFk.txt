what's up everybody welcome to your fit tutorial and what I'm going to do is I'm going to teach you how to resize images got this little bear thing that I found them we'd get this done quickly so we got we'll start with the blank page and of course if you remember your file has to be like bear one has to be the same by your index like what you're just adding an image and I'm going to show you how to resize it so let's take it we'll have the image then we'll have its bear one jpg and then who's tips T we're defilade actually I get distracted easy cuz it'll keep going off so hold on so that thought find you and make your something real quick dumb people sorry anyway so you get your image and then you close it and when you save this you know you open it up you have your picture well sometimes pictures will be bigger or if it's bigger pictures that you have that you want to put on your website that could be just like all down this like all around it and it could make it where you had to scroll on everything I'm going to show you how to fix it it's another it's inside the image source you take height equals parentheses and then we'll just put 150 and what that 150 is is it's pixels it's 150 pixels it's it'll just make it words bigger or smaller which in this case we'll put a smaller so it's 150 pixels and we'll save that you can see the change here I go from here and it goes down to there this makes a smaller smaller so it's the 150 pixels that change it input 400 pixels or whatever and each time it just changes it higher smaller it's all about the size of the pickles our pickles geez pixels where if you have height and then you have your pixels right here so yeah pixels not the pickles and it goes in and let what a lot of people think if you have like a huge image like let's say 800 and you take it and you bring that up they think it's going to take longer to load your webpage no that's not the thing it's still going to load the regular size of the image will still load the regular size but what it's doing is the computer second all right they want 150 pixels so we'll load it and right before it comes up we'll resize that image so I'm still going to load the execs like it's not going to show the exact size but it's going to load the exact size that's just going to change the pixels it's very simple there's nothing to it at all it's very easy tag it's just writing size here resize the image if you have a terrible huge image that I get to scroll you can put small pixels or if it's really small pixels like you said like 25 pixels or type of 4 or 25 and you refresh it's gonna be pretty small you can't see it and then you're like well what's that so if you go to you've got 25 pixels you know it's small and then you put let's say a thousand and then you're going to be like well there's going to be a lot bigger well you're right it is it even Scrolls so you don't want that big and plus it's you want kind of where you can see inaudible horry and stuff so let's put back to 150 I mean resize the image any way you want and get later on I'll go and talk to you now centering and then it's because I'm really OCD about this stuff I liked everything centered all you have to do is right before the source code are the image source you just type in center you have your center tag here and then you have your center tag here and you do that if you put it Center tag if you like I'll save this for example so we got this and it goes to the center but if you have this is why you have to have a closing tag code so let's say you have let's just put a break and then you have just h1 or h2 don't matter this is going to be centered and so then you have jeez I can't talk today so then you have you close your Center here and so or even if you don't close it then if you don't even close it then watch look what happens it's all just going to be centered I mean it whoops Hilton never it's not going to work so you have to make sure you have your centers here you close that so when it goes then it's centered here but it's not here you've got to watch your tags watch your closing if there's any errors just go over it you guys get used to it the main part I was getting to today was how to resize the image but that is centering an image and that kind of teach you how to center a lot of things but this is tutorial 5 thanks for watching
