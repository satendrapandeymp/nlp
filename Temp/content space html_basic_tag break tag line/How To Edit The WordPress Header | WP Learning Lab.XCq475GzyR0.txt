[Music] you learn from the AP Learning Lab in this tutorial I'm going to show you where to find the wordpress header.php file where you can make the edits you need to make i'm not going to show you any edits to do in there because i have no idea what you're doing and really because you're in the PHP file the ability to do stuff is pretty much limitless so there's really not much I can show you because I have no idea what you want to accomplish if you tell me what you need you can comment in the comments below and I'll see if I can help you out but barring math here's how you find the header dot PHP file so you can make some edits first we log in the dashboard then we go to appearance and we click on editor and I'm going to press command F or ctrl F and type in header.php and we have the header file show up here click on that to load that file into the editor and this is now all the PHP in the header file for the array the theme and I can go in here I can enter whatever I want this looks very intimidating if you're not familiar with WordPress hooks theme hooks and PHP so if you're not familiar with those I don't recommend you mess around in here because one wrong move and the whole site goes down so it really isn't a place to mess around if you don't know what you're doing one drawback of using the editor like this is if you could change when you save it you can't undo what you did so you either have to remember what you did and then change it back if you break something or you have to go and download an original theme rate a theme copy of the header file and look in there to see what the original should look like a way to get around this is using an FTP client so I have the site pulled up an FTP right here if we go to the content folder themes folder provide a theme and then find the header file and right click on it and choose open with and then I'm using sublime text 2 as my default editor and here I can make a change for example if we go to the live site we see it loads just fine now if I go and I'm just going to delete all of this save this file and this is going to crash the site refresh this page and holy moley that's not the site should look like this can happen at any second when you're editing a Nadder file or any PHP file and then WordPress theme for that matter so now is when the adrenaline kicks in a little bit panicked if you're in the editor in the theme editor over here you have to know exactly what you took out otherwise you can't get it back very quickly you can always download the original file like I said and find the original but I might take too long so instead if you're using using FTP in a text editor I can just go into edit menu click on undo left delete it puts all the stuff back save the file files uploaded again refresh this page cross my fingers and everything is back to how it should be so that's the benefit of using FTP client even if you edit this file in the cPanel file manager there is no undo command in most of those file managers so you make that change you better know what you changed it in case something breaks I recommend you use FTP client to do it and I also recommend that you don't mess around too much in here unless you know what you're doing or you know the exact thing you want to do for example you might just be copying and pasting a Google search console verification code meta tag in here in which case you just go in here and paste the meta tag let's pretend this is that nice copied one from below save the file and then it's all good you're not going to break anything by just adding meta tag as long as as long as you don't interfere with any PHP commands some simple changes like that anybody can do more advanced changes do it only if you know what you're doing and make sure you have a way to revert back to a working copy if the site breaks and that's where we edit the header dot PHP file of the city helps you - you're on all pass in W Learning Labs please make sure you like this video shann social media subscribe to youtube channel and check out
