what is going on guys and welcome to HTML tutorial in this video we're going to talk about a very interesting element in HTML and it is called iframe element and what iframe element is is that it's basically like a little frame that actually links your website to let's a different website or the different page in your own website or image or most popular it's actually used to display a Google Maps on your website so let's go ahead and let's create a I frame element and the way we do that we would have to create a I frame element over here and the name and self explainatory would be iframe over here so I just click over here and we would have to use a source attribute and source attribute would basically tell the browser where to look for iframe element and in this case I'm gonna create an external source and it's gonna be ESPN so I would have to type over here the HTTP and over here I'll create espn.com and I'm gonna close it over here the iframe and you can see that I have either ESPN over here now the thing is my iframe is pretty much automatically set by default but I can use two more attributes to control the width and I hide the same as with the image so here I would say with let's say and I would say that I would want with to be 300 pixels and I would want my height to be let's say 300 pixels right so you can see all of a sudden how it's changing and if I just make this on a website a little bit bigger that I'm working with in index over here you can see that my iframe is getting bigger or smaller depending on how I would change the width and a height of my iframe now we could also link to the pages with in our own document so let's say you can see over here that info page that we created and I'm just gonna create a live preview over here to see that let's see over here this is our info page you can see the name over here and I'm actually going to zoom in so you can see that this is our info page and this is our index page right where we have the ESPN but if we go back to our index over here and let's say I'm gonna change the source I'm gonna change it from the ESPN I'm gonna change it actually to info and if I write over here the bracket gives me right away code hints over here so if I just say this and refresh over here now you can see that I am in my index page right you can see I'm gonna zoom in here however the iframe is actually pointing today different web page within my own page that that is actually they the info page now I could also use the iframe to actually connect it to the images that I have over here in my image folder so let's say I would write the source over here instead of info I'm gonna write a images that's the folder that my images are located and now I have two options those are the two images that I have downloaded right so let's say that I want Kevin Hart over here so I'm just gonna save this over here and I'm gonna refresh and you can see that now my iframe is displaying a image that's actually located in my images folder now another cool thing that we could do with my friends we could actually use links to point to our iframe and actually display whatever the location of our links are so let's say over here that I have iframe and we're here that I was actually pointing to the picture but I'm gonna get rid of this source over here so it's just gonna be empty and it's gonna be as you can see the width is gonna be 300 then the height is still gonna be 300 then you can see in our life preview the diaphragm is still here however there's no source so that's why it's blank right and what I'm gonna do over here I'm gonna create a name over here for this iframe and I'm just gonna name it frame over here right so I have my frame it's blank but it has a name and over here I'm gonna start creating links and the first link I'm gonna create is actually gonna go again to ESPN so I'm gonna say HTTP and it's gonna be not with three P's so I would have to fix it over here and I'm gonna write ESPN over here dot-com and in here I'm going to use another attribute and it's gonna be target attribute and the target attribute I'm gonna write the same name that I given the iframe so you can see that i given the attribute name I gave the value of frame so right now when I'm doing the target when I'm writing the target attribute I would need to use the same value that I gave it to name so I'm gonna write the frame over here and I'm gonna create a ESPN over here so now I can see the link and usually in in any case before that when we created a links they were actually going externally so let's go ahead and see what happens now that we have created a link that actually has the target attribute over here and it's linking to our iframe right no no I'm just gonna save this file over here and I'm just gonna click it a refresh over here and then you can see as I press over here on a link actually the ESPN is loading here in my iframe so I didn't have to point it with the source I could actually do it with the link and the cool thing about it is then I could let's say create a another link over here I'm just gonna create a lifeline break before that and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy this the whole thing over here and now I have two links and I'm gonna create a one more over here so I'm just gonna say I'm gonna I'm gonna select this and I'm just gonna copy that so now I can see that no just I deleted but I'm gonna copy it again and now you can see that I have three links all of them are pointing to ESPN so we're gonna fix that over here so what I'm gonna do is this location.href I'm gonna change it to it let's say info page that we did before so now I have HCF over here info HTML but you can see that I'm still using the target and the target is still the frame which is name my attribute over here so over here and I'm gonna create a different name I'm gonna say that this is gonna be the info page and the last thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna actually create a image over here and our link is gonna be to the image and I'm gonna say that the image is gonna be funny or let's say Kevin Hart and over here I'm gonna use the href to point to my image over here so I'm gonna say images over here and then I'm gonna find my picture with Kevin Hart okay so I'm gonna save this over here and now you can see what happens when i refresh it over here you can see that I have it blank but as I'm pressing now I have the ESPN then I have the info page and then I have Kevin Hart over here and you can also notice here that my page is not reloading as I'm doing this so when I'm pressing over here the ESPN that it's not opening the new page it's it's still working or yeah and the same thing happens when if I have info page or Kevin Hart over here so what's happening is that you don't need to reload your page in order to use the iframe you can it's actually doing while you're still on your page so it saves the time for whoever is visiting your web page that the page is not downloading twice right so the last thing that we're gonna do is we're actually gonna create a Google Maps in our iframe so I'm just gonna delete it over here everything altogether so now you can see that I have a blank page and I'm gonna show you that let's say that if you would be creating a page for let's say some kind some type of business and you would want to use the Google Maps to actually point to that web page right to actually to point to that location so I'll go here I would open up the web browser and I have Google over here by default so I'm just gonna write Maps and you can see or hear that the my Google Maps gonna open the little maps and what we would need to do is we would need to write the name of our business that we will want to pointed out or the address or anything anything of that sort so in this case I'm gonna type the business and you can see that this is gonna be a very good steak steak house in Chicago and this is gonna be tango sir so now I can see that the web page I'm sorry is that Google Maps is pointing to the business what we can do is over here you can see that share or just click share and we have share link or which we have embed map and once we click on embed map we can see that I frame is given already for us right so all we have to do is actually copy this one over here and then we go back to our text editor and all we have to do is actually paste this over here and now you can see that our iframe is already made for us but you can see that it has already default height and width and what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna make it to 300 and this one is also gonna be 300 so now I can see that if I just make this live preview bigger you can see how we have a map the Google map on our website using the iframe element and like what I can do is I can always zoom in or zoom out over here using the iframe and using the Google map so you can see how it is a very very neat feature this is gonna be it for this video guys thank you very much for watching and I'll see you next [Music]
