hi guys in this video we'll learn about the anchor tag and its attributes so let's get started well anchor tag is used to link one HTML page to another what this means is you see I have a page here when I click on this text it takes me to another page all this linking between pages is done through anchor tag let's write a simple code to understand this here is my basic HTML code structure that is HTML and the body tags let's start by writing anchor tags so I write opening and closing anchor tag and here I right click here to go to YouTube well this text between opening and closing anchor tag will be highlighted in our web page by clicking on this text you will be able to go to the next link page well anchor tag has a lot of attributes which we'll discuss in the later part of this video for now I'll use H ref attribute here well href attribute specifies the URL or path of the page we wish to link to now in our example we wish to link our page with YouTube so we'll write the URL of YouTube so let's do that HTTP www.youtube.com let's save and run this here is my page and this is the highlighted texture we mentioned in the opening and closing anchor tag let's click on this text you can see as I clicked on the texture it took me to another page so we have linked our page to another page with the help of anchor tag now here is a list of attributes supported by anchor tag let's discuss each of these attributes with simple examples first is href attribute well we know that anchor tag is used to link one page to another the href attribute specifies the URL or path of the page we wish to link href attribute can be used in following situations number 1 linking our page to some other site second linking pages on the same site third linking to an email address fourth linking to a specific section on the same page fifth linking to a specific section on some other page let's see each of these situations one by one linking our page to some other site when linking our page to some other website we mentioned the absolute URL of the other website here is an example here we wish to link our page to YouTube and you can see we have mentioned the absolute URL of YouTube in href attribute well a lot of you might not be knowing what absolute and relative URL means for those people I would say please watch my videos on these topics for this video I presume you know what absolute and relative URL means next is linking our page to another page on the same site well when linking two pages on the same site we can use relative as well as absolute URL in the href attribute here is an example of absolute URL we have two files here index dot HTML and contact dot HTML of the same site you can see we have lingual contact dot HTML with index dot HTML using absolute URL of contact dot HTML here is an example of relative URL you can see in this example we have linked index dot HTML with contact dot HTML using the relative address of contact dot HTML next is linking an email address well we can open the user's email program when the user clicks on the link specified by the anchor tag with the help of href attribute in the following way here in this example you can see we have written H ref equals male 2 colon and then the email ID which we wish to link now when the user will click on the link the user's email program will open where he can send email to this particular email id next is linking to a specific section of the page this is done using name or ID attribute let's understand name and ID attribute now well name attribute is used to create a link to a specific section of a page let's see how this looks like you can see on this page I have a lot of headings heading 1 heading 2 heading 3 and so on let's say you want to reach to a specific section on this page say headings so you would normally scroll down to do so but there's another way to reach heading six that is by using name attribute on this link you would be able to reach to any desired section which in our case is heading section this kind of linking where I can link to a specific section of a page is done with name attribute now how do I use name attribute well we will learn to use name attribute in two situations number one linking to a specific section on the same page number two linking to a specific section on a different page let's first see how to link to a specific section on the same page here you can see I have already written the basic code structure that is I have written all the headings heading 1 2 and so on till 18 now inside this code we will use the name attribute the first step in doing so is to assign name to the section we wish to link using name attribute in our cases we wish to link to heading 6 so we have assigned name say h6 to heading 6 section in the second step we create link to the section while doing so the value of H safer equals hash and then the value of the name attribute assigned in step 1 well this is it that's all you need to do to add name attribute let's write the code we just saw to practically see what is happening I am now in my text editor so let's start writing the code I start with HTML opening and closing tags then comes the body tags now inside the body tags ooh I will write all the headings so let me just quickly write the headings we are done with headings now we will add the name attribute heading sex is the section we wish to link so I'll assign name to this section we write the anchor tag and inside the anchor tag I use name attribute name equals to H section you can choose any other name as well now in the second step we create link to the section we just named so I write anchor tag and inside it I write H ref equals hash and the name which is xx so we are done coding let's save and run this let me click on this link you can see this link takes me to heading 6 section of the page now let's learn how to link to a specific section on a different page here you can see I have two files heading one dot HTML and name attribute dot HTML I want when the user clicks on the link in this file it should take him directly to heading 6 of this page instead of taking him to the default which is the top of the page well steps in doing so remains the same that is we first assign name using the name attribute and then use HF to link to the section the difference lies in the value of HF here H F equals URL of the link file followed by a hash and the value of the name attribute now let's understand the ID attribute ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to a particular tag it can be used as an alternative to name attribute please note that ID attribute can be used with almost any tag unlike name attribute which is used with anchor tag only now let's compare name and ID attribute on the Left we have link to a section using name attribute vile on the right we have used the ID attribute in the first code you see we need an extra anchor tag to assign name to the section we wish to link while in the other code there is no need to add an extra tag because ID attribute can be used with almost any tag so we have used eye d attribute with an already-existing h1 tag to uniquely identify the section
