this is very important this is where we will go ahead and find the location of our map I'll write the name of the map will be Ward was Ward map all right perfect now everything is working fine control s or you can come here and click Save let's go back here to our and click f5 or you can refresh the page here alright this is our image all right perfect now in a note here I will have to go ahead and give you a quick description and how the image map alright so here let's go ahead and create a paragraph here alright so we use here the rectangle coordinate all right so the red color coordinate is X 1 which is the first coordinate and it has y 1 this is the second coordinate and again X 1 X 2 now and Y 2 so we have x-value and y-value and this means means here is so this will be here the top all right so this will be here the left top and the right button all right perfect and it closed in this paragraph tag here alright and also let me just copy this and control C on down here control V paste in this case we'll use also the circle the cell per coordinate and the circle coordinate and need the X Y and you need the radius all right so on it is less to ladies all right control s from here f5 alright so everything is working good here now let's go ahead and now create the clicker ball effect all right so to create a clipboard I felt effect here you have to use the map attribute which is to do so open the map tag here and then name it first of all let's close it and then open another one make sure you close it all right so and inside here the name of how not here wowza the world on map all right perfect now let's go ahead now inside here double click here alright so inside here now we have to create the area which is a where we'll use to and to do the clickable effect alright so for the rectangle coordinate you have to import the area and then the shape type it's here is the rectangle shape type and the coordinate here you write codes and equals and then we write this one inside and the alternate name would be here this is for North America all right and then close the Aria tag just slash and then go ahead and close it alright so we will go ahead and copy this alright so before I even actually copy this nun and you need to specify here and what coordinate you need here so you need the X 1 Y x1 y1 x2 y2 to do so let's go ahead and locate our map here and right click on it and open it with paint alright alright perfect is not open with blank go ahead and click view and make sure that you select rulers and then start a spa alright so this will allow you to give you the coordinate all right perfect now let's go back here now to in order to be able to click on the North America so this form a rectangle so this is basically a rectangle this is the rectangle that you need to be form let's use probably the right color for you so you can see all right so sorry so basically this is a rectangle here and it goes like that and you close this one so inside the rectangle here what you need to do here you need to have a coordinate here one point here and one point here same thing with this if you have it if you have a something like that then you need to create a coordinate here so in this case I will use it all this so I will use this point here alright so on this is the value of x1 y1 so this point is currently on the 35 here and is X is 35 and is y is about 105 so this point here is 105 35 105 alright so what what you need to do here it is cool and robably use this a little bit dot all right so this coordinate here is the one the first coordinate that you need to type here so he has here 35 that's the x1 and y1 is 105 all right so now let's go ahead and select the second coordinate the second coordinate would be here so this is the value here it seems here it's about 170 the x value and here it's about 120 all right so this is another point here so one 70 and 120 make sure you write comments all right so this is a alright so let's go ahead and copy this alright and paste it one time again twice third time and then let's delete those coordinates you need to specify and this one let's let's say we'll do here Latin America this one so the second coordinate here let's delete this and this alright so this is going to be here this copy this is going to be Latin America and the second one will be Africa all right and then we'll also have Europe and then the last one will be just paste it again get it that and this one will be a Europa this one will be cozy and yeah all right all right perfect let's control s let's save that now let's find the coordinate of the Latin America all right so to do so here all right so again you have to select this coordinate here at this point and the second coordinate would be here so here it's in that location it's about 75 for the x value from 0 to 75 and the y value is zero to here to ten all right so let's see here 75 to 10 comma and then the other value here goes from 200 to 225 all right so 200 come on 225 all right so let's do that for also Africa here Africa is right here and this gives you 260 about 260 and the point here it's about let's see here 335 nah let's see here here's about 138 alright so 140 something like that alright s go ahead and type here so you want to 60 coma 140 alright so let's see now the second point here also it does this point actually this point is yes this 335 and 158 all right c'mon 335 158 all right so let's go for the Europe now all right Europe here so this is about 236 or 240 and then on here it's about Slendy all right so this one would be also 236 c'mon 7d and then let's see here say by 300 300 or say three or five or three or five and now let's see here 85 alright so this is going to be here 335 sorry 305 come on see that 85 all right 85 all right control s all right so the last one here I will do the circle one all right so and you can change this here to right circle here and all right so this is what we need to do I will show you that in a few second actually let's write the rectangle here and you can also write the alright and then here the coordinate for that will be listed here all right actually Asia this is actually a GRS to this all right so Asia would be about for 25 to 125 all right process was a free culture so this is zero and then this was Asia all right the coordinate was here like fall 25 comma 125 and then see here it's about 470 and 130 135 all right so here you have 470 and 140 all right and the last one here would be the Oceania control C control all right so here is Joseon all right so here the final one would be the one this coordinate which is like about five hundred to five hundred and 240 all right so I have here five hundred 240 all right and the last one here would be probably one this year will be let's see here actually I want this to be the circle so in this case we'll do the circle alright so and then I want this to be here now for the circle here you need your radius X and you need a value of XY and it's radius to do so here so let's say let's suppose this is a circle like that so you want the value in the center which will give you this value x value so I have here about 500 so and then this value will be about 240 and then the radius will be from here to here which is a bot let's count here and 20 30 40 so it's about 40 here so the last one will be about 40 all right so this is how you do for the circle so the distance he of here is about 40 all right so everything seems to be working fine here now let's go ahead and right just hear a paragraph tag here and inside here let's adjust and alright for more video is it listen to that calm our life and I want it enter tag here for example so I can have it clickable and here you can write your high or and start alright so is hyper hyper text Transfer Protocol /ww DSL cable calm alright so and control s so everything seems to be working fine here let's go ahead and control s or save and then let's go ahead and refresh our all right so all right in that is something here something on here let me go back in see the code here what's going on paragraph are open a pro-rata close our pretend entered a close alrighty oh here I make sure that equals this alright and actually I want to start this over a bit text a line in the center this control s come back here at five alright so and if you want the phone here to be a little bit bigger you want probably font size you can write here phone size 25 itself alright so that will be a 25 pixel here the phone size and then all right so let's see videos everything seems to be working fine here now let's go ahead and check the program here very quick alright so we create a doctype here alright so here this error make sure that it's a language or has the G here and also and here also I just remarked make sure that you remove this because of the Aria and doesn't have here closing and is really dramatic closing map is already here so it doesn't include that and make sure that this is actually close here together alright so everything seems to be working fine here and also here I'll go ahead and actually enter the attribute here so when you click on it it will take you to a link to say here's I'm still calm and let me just copy this come here and paste it Christie Christie Christie you see one time twice and here let's see here I want another one SNC 200 all right so let's go ahead control s and or if you can go ahead save here and let's go back to our folder here and now I want to open it with a different browser let's say here we open it with Google Chrome all right so all right so that's what we created let's go ahead and click on see here all right so you see it is a very nice smooth here and this is the the previous tutorial but I mentioned to you that we'll be creating and then this is the smooth one and close this actually alright so let's go ahead and click here and see all right this will take you to another page here and let me go ahead and alright Sonia let's see here what's going on let's go back to the page here alright probably Anita HTTP Robbie alright ctrl s and let's go back to our chrome here but first a page and come here and click on it alright so this will take you to and a page alright so this is how you add also an a clickable image here all right perfect and then this is actually a video were created that you can publish your notepad video here you can also publish and this application that you just created alright so everything seems to be working fine here and let's see if we can do something else ready a lot of fun here alright so basically make sure that you have the HTTP if you want your clickable to go to another page alright so that will debut and then let's check for the North America here ctrl s and then come here and let's go back here all right click f5 alright so if you click here not America this will take it to another link alright perfect alright so you can create something cool like that and this is this is called an image clickable and using the the map attribute here which is the tag allow you to create a clickable area and does have a shape of a rectangle or a shape of a rectangle or a shape of his sorry a shape of a circle or a ship of a year it down all right so this is how you create it all right so I hope this tutorial was not too long
