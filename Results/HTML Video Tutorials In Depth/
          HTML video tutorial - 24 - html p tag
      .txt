hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series in the previous tutorial we understood how we can apply a background image to the webpage in this tutorial I am going to discuss paragraph tag how we can create paragraphs I am going to double click on the first page dot HTML Firefox will get open I right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad here I have one WordPad file I right click open with the word pad I have some content you can see that I have three cap paragraphs one related to physics one related to chemistry one related to biology so I copy this physics paragraph right click copy and paste it in notepad here I'm gonna paste file save go to browser refresh check this out the paragraph is displayed in the web page I go back to WordPad I copy the information related to the chemistry right click copy that and paste it in notepad I give an enter ok and I paste it file save if i refresh you people might be thinking that this chemistry paragraph is going to be displayed down here no it is not going to be displayed there if i refresh observe what happens if i refresh can you see that the chemistry paragraph is just in front of the physics paragraph it is not moved to the next line why we have learnt already that how HTML interprets the white-spaces HTML ignores all white spaces and enter keys that you have pressed it is going to collapse all the white space to a single white space do you remember that so it collapses all the white spaces to single white space and the final result that you are going to see is something like this if I say file save and refresh both are same not much change you can see that so this is how the white spaces are interpreted by the browsers so chemistry paragraph is not displayed in the next line no problem we will sort out this problem let me copy one more paragraph I have one more paragraph with respect to biology I am going to copy that from there and paste it here I hit enter and paste so what do you think whether the biology paragraph is displayed down here or it is displayed in front of the previous paragraph yes you have assumed correct it is going to be displayed in front of the previous paragraph the reason is all white spaces are collapsed to a single white space so we are going to find something like this the final result is going to be something like this file save good browser refresh you can see that biology a paragraph is displayed in front of the previous paragraph we need to take a help of paragraph tag that is P tag which is available in the HTML to create three different paragraphs properly P tag is a block level tag as well as P tag is a paid tag as it is a pair tag there will be opening tag and a closing tag just before this P character I am going to write opening P tag okay then after this system text that we have I am going to say closing paragraph tag what we told from here to here it is one paragraph okay let me arrange it properly so from here to here I told that to the system that this is one paragraph as paragraph tag is a block level tag it takes entire width of the browser window and whatever the content after this paragraph tag is moved to the next line so the chemistry paragraph and the biology paragraph are moved down let's see that file save go to browser refresh check this out now the paragraph related to physics is in a proper place and the chemistry and the biology paragraph moved to the next line I want to tell to the system that from here to here it is related to the chemistry so I need to create a paragraph for it so what I have to do I have to use a paragraph tag I can put it on the next line here no problem in that and I can write here opening paragraph tag P tag okay and Here I am going to write a closing paragraph tag and we should remember that whatever the information after this paragraph is going to be moved to the next line so this biology information is moved to the next line file save go to browser refresh check this out biology paragraph is now separated from the chemistry paragraph I can make this one also as a one separate paragraph so I am going to say here P opening P tag and then here I am going to say closing P tag file save good browser refresh you can see that I have created three different paragraphs one for physics one for chemistry and one for biology this is how you can use the paragraph tag in HTML to create paragraphs you should remember that paragraph tag adds little bit space after the paragraph you can see that there is a space between the physics paragraph and the chemistry paragraph right and there is a space between chemistry paragraph and the biology paragraph so automatically the P tag adds a space below the paragraph okay you can think like one small extra space that looks good very good now we are going to understand an attribute related to the paragraph tag so there is an attribute called as a line that we have already seen with respect to the heading tag here also we have a line attribute so I give a space I write here a line a lign equal to double quotations here I can give values by default align attribute value is left left4dead can see that no change if I want I can align the paragraph to the center if I say si nter Center file save and refresh you can see that the physics paragraph is aligned in the center of the webpage similarly we have option to align towards right ri ght right file save go to browser refresh you can see that the content of the physics paragraph is aligned to the right of the browser window we can apply one more value to the align attribute that is just T 5 just T 5 file save go to browser refresh check that out what happened here by applying the justify means it has aligned the left-hand side of the paragraph and the right-hand side of the paragraph in an equal way you can see that if I remove this align attribute okay just save file save and refresh you can see that there is a zigzag Ness at the end of these lines if you want to align both side of the paragraph properly then you have to use a line justify align justify justifies both the sides of the paragraph so file save good browser refresh you can see that now it looks proper similarly same align justify I can use to this paragraph also file save go to browser refresh you can see that alignment is happened properly I can use the align attribute with the biologic paragraph also file save go to browser refresh so all are aligned properly now it looks good it looks nice right if I want I can increase the font size by using the font tag here I'm going to save font I can say size equals to maybe 5 and all the paragraphs I'm going to put inside the font tag so here outside I'm going to say closing font tag file save and come to browser and refresh check that out all paragraphs are increase in font size hope you guys have understood how you can use the paragraph tag how you can use the attribute what is the meaning of justify value for the align attribute for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial keep learning
