hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right click on default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss about background color how we can set background color to the table table row and table heading let's discuss step by step I can say BGC bow elbow RPG color and I can give value here cyan file save go to browser refresh you can see that the tsiyon color is set to the background of the table if you want you can use the hexadecimal values also hash 0 0 FF FF file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have set the sign color file save go to browser refresh no change if you want to set some other color like magenta something like that you can use FF 0 0 FF file save go to browser refresh you can see that we set the magenta color or you can use ma GE and ta magenta as the value file save go to browser refresh no change this is how you can set the background to the entire table if you want the background color to be different for different rows then we have to use the BG color to the table row tags first I said this to sign sya and sign file save go to browser refresh now we have the sign color set as a background let's set the background color to this table row I copy here and paste it now we are telling background color for this table row should be maybe grey I said GRA why grey file save go to browser refresh you can see that the table heading row is now displayed in a grey color are you understanding similarly I can set the background colors to these cells I am going to copy this paste it to this row and I say the color is going to be orange file save go to browser refresh you can see that we set this to orange color next I paste here and then I say here maybe ye ll whoa W yellow file save go to browser refresh you can see that I have a yellow color applied to this row again I paste here I change the color to a are a and GE orange file save go to browser refresh we set the orange color if we want we can add one more table row I am going to copy this from here I copy this table row paste it down background color is yellow this is going to be 4 this is going to be Ronald Rona LD Ronald where value for this one is maybe 65% and his past file save go to browser refresh you can see that now we can be able to set the background colors to each row sometimes you might be needed to set the background color to the cell itself then you have to use the background color specifically in required cells so let's take I want to set this 1 2 3 4 first column should be in a grey color then I go here paste it BG color and then I say here gray you can see this TD file save go to browser refresh change to the gray color similarly I can copy this and paste it in every TD cell file save go to browser refresh you can see this is in gray color similarly I go to this three text TD cell refresh similarly I go to 4 here file save go to browser refresh hope you guys have understood how we can set the background color to the entire row entire column entire table even for each cell let's proceed sometimes you might be interested to display this 1 2 3 4 also in darker color then what you need means you need to convert the normal TD to table heading I go here to one I change the TD to th here I change this to th file save go to browser refresh you can see that it is now 1 and automatically centered also that is good no problem similarly this one I change to th and here I say th file save go to browser refresh similarly I can do down here th-th-this stadia change to th this theory I change to th file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have the numbers displayed in bold the gray color and the black color are mixing blending right let's change the text color to white how do you change the text color to white we don't have any foreground color like that there is no attribute called FG color to set the foreground color or there is no attribute called as text color what you need means you have to use the font tag itself let's use a font tag over here I hit enter I hit enter here let me put this in between the font tag I use a font tag I say color to WH ite white okay then after the name serial number I am going to close the font tag let me put it a little bit back so that we can see properly file save good browser refresh you can see that now we have the serial number text displayed in white color same thing I perform with these things I am going to copy this from here and I hit enter tab tab tab hit enter tab tab tab tab now I put it back paste I close the font tag F greater than font file save go to browser refresh similarly I go down for this one control-v font file save good browser refresh then I go down here control V then I say close font hope you guys are understanding how we can set the text color refresh if I remove border itself if I remove the border I set the border to zero then say file save go to browser and refresh check how it looks it looks nice right hope you guys have understood in this tutorial we discussed how we can apply the color to the table for more benefits please subscribe like comment
