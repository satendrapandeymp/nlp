so I've got a note to myself here a comment to myself it says we need to figure out how to do a copyright symbol for the text below so let's figure that out now the reason we can't just cut and paste copyright symbols is that they're not necessarily going to display the same way in every single browser and or in every single computer so we need to actually insert when you're writing HTML there's a little little bits of code a little special code that that will get translated into the symbol that you want what I'm talking about symbols I'm talking about things like copyright symbols trademark symbols I'm even talking about some letters some special letters like like accented letters or special letters that are not non-standard letters in the in the English alphabet so let's figure out how to do this um what I always do is some of the codes you just end up using so much that you learn them by heart but I'm not good at learning things by heart so instead what I do is I tend to just do a quick google search and I'm going to look up HTML codes just gonna look that up what we're looking for is a table of ASCII characters and symbols any of these would do but I just always click I'm lazy I click on the first one in here this will help us hear what we see here is a list of HTML codes for a whole bunch of characters that you might want to have on your website and these are kind of I mean these are some symbols here like here's an ampersand that's actually something but let's look for the copyright one and I'm gonna scroll down here these are all plain letters we don't need to type out codes for that although you actually could which is kind of funny let's scroll down ah here we go this is what we want see right here this here's the copyright symbol that's the symbol do we want and it actually says in the description here copyright sign and what you want you're looking for either the HTML name or I like to use the HTML number and the HTML number is a ampersand number sign 1 6 9 and then a semicolon and it's important to include that entire thing and guess what folks I don't like typing this stuff out I like copying it I'm gonna select it all I'm just copy that and let's switch over to our text Wrangler and what we're gonna do is we're just going to replace the word copyright with this little symbol right here now doesn't look right on here but wait wait till you see what happens I save that and let's go back to our Google Chrome and let's go and reload this so keep an eye on this right here we're gonna hit reload there's the symbol so even though it's a you know this weird code this ampersand is hashtag one six nine semicolon then the browser knows how to interpret this and the browser will interpret that correctly consistently no matter what browser you're in so if you're cutting and pasting text from a different source and your source includes things like you know maybe exon to use in French or or different types of special characters like here's a few examples like you know the yen sign for example or or all sorts of her like you know half the symbol for a fraction of one half or here's a whole bunch of of you know accents you know accent a grave or a acute and all sorts of things like that you can go ahead and you can copy that you can try copying that in your your your HTML code but then when you load it up in Chrome or Safari or Firefox or whatever you're gonna have funky stuff happens so you don't want that so that's how we add a copyright symbol or any symbol in fact to a a website that's it so I hope you found that useful thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
