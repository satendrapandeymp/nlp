hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 18th you told in this course in this tutorial we're going to wrap up our discussion on links and we're going to see how we can include email links in our webpages so this is going to be a very short tutorial and I you know hardly have any text in my HTML file here so I'm just gonna jump in the body section and in the body section I have you know opening P tag on line number 9 and the closing P tag on the same line and the text that I have between the opening and closing paragraph taxes send us an email right and around this text I have wrapped around the anchor tag and which has the value mail too and then there's a colon and then there is an email address so you know let's say you have a website and you know you have you want to have a link on the website and if people click on that link then you know the default mail program opens up so that could be Microsoft Outlook or it could be Thunderbird or whatever and that pro program opens up and then using that program if they have you know configure it and all they can send you emails now this is not very popular actually because you know very few people use you know mail programs and for those who don't this is really not useful but for those who do you know this is again very convenient as well so you know you could use it or you could not use it it depends on your users really so male 2 and then a colon and then the email address to which you want the mail to be sent so let's say I want the email to be sent to all about links at gmail.com so you know I would type in that here and you know you could just finish the tag there by having your closing quotation mark but if suppose you also want you know a subject line for the mail that you receive on this email address and if you also want some text in the body of the mail then you have to include the following text as well so you type in the word subject after a question mark following the email address and then you use the assignment operator or the equal to symbol and write the subject you don't have to put a in single quotes or double quotes you just have to type it you know in the same set of double quotation marks as you've used for the value of the href attribute you just type in whatever subject you want so over here I've typed in I space love space your space side and then there is an exclamation symbol and the text that I want in the body is just kidding and again I have assigned this value using the assignment operator that you see here and I've also included in the ampersand between the subject line and the body line and this is important you know this is part of HTML syntax it's a requirement so you have subject equals value and then the ampersand symbol and then body equals value and then you have the closing double quotation mark of the value you know that you've assigned to the xref attribute here and then you know I have closed the anchor tag after closing the paragraph tag on nine number nine I'll save this file and when I open it in Google Chrome this is how it looks right so there's this link and if I click on it then I actually use Microsoft Outlook so it might take a little bit time because you know I use Outlook 2013 so there you go when I clicked on it this opened up and the email address is already there in the to field here which is all about links at gmail.com the subject line is already filled I love your site and you know the text is there in the body of the mail - just kidding so this is how email links work in HTML and I hope you guys found this tutorial interesting and you know useful and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already assume the next video which will discuss more HTML features and see you next video till then take care
