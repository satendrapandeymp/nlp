we're going to review what we've done in the last several videos and we're going to talk about what we're going to do in this video and we're going to talk about what we're going to do in the next video now remember JavaScript at its basic level is a two-step process first we want to select the element we want to target and we accomplish that through methods we've talked about getting an element using the get element by ID method and of course we select elements by their ID and in the last couple videos we talked about get elements by tag name and that's where we were allowed to select multiple elements by their tag in this video we're actually going to talk about get elements by class name yes there's yet another method that we can use to grab hold of an element and remember these three methods are pretty much doing the same thing it's just how are we grabbing the element and with get elements by class name we are grabbing it by the class name that's how we're grabbing it now once we've accomplished that first step we can move on to the second step and that is to change whatever it is we want to change in that element we've actually been changing CSS Styles right we added a background color we've changed the color of the text that's what we've been doing the last several videos but there are many other things you can do with JavaScript in the next video we're actually going to talk about changing the text itself and what do I mean by that we're actually going to replace the text so that'll be something new we're introducing to the series you can also change images you can do validation you can create entire new pages and you can change the internal so we'll talk about all these subjects in later videos but in this video we're going to talk about the get elements by class name method okay so we're going to pretty much use the same code we've been using throughout the last several videos we have a button and when we hit that button we're going to change the text and we're going to apply a new CSS style to it the only difference is we're using classes now take a look at that so let's flip over to our JavaScript code and I'll copy and paste the first step we need to do remember first step we need to get that element and what are we using this time we're going to go by class name so we're specifying the class right here para and you can see that right here and similar to the get elements by tag method the get elements by class name also creates a node list so keep in mind when you have a method in JavaScript it's grabbing multiple elements almost always that node list is going to be created and so this first paragraph will be node list 0 the second one will be one and on and on and on it could go one two three four five six seven if we had a ton of paragraphs in here we could have a very very huge node list but in this case it's just going to be two zero for the first one and remember we always start at zero and one for the second one and so that node list is key because then we can specify the paragraph that we want to target once we get a hold of all of our classes and so that's what this is doing right here and so this method is very similar to the get elements by tag name method the only difference is we're going against class okay so now let's do the second step we want to actually apply some CSS style to our text so I'll copy and paste the code in here and again this will look similar to what we've been doing here is the node list again we need to specify that we're creating a new variable called change text appropriately and again each one of these lines of code is going against the paragraph that we want to target so again node list 0 and node list 1 and of course we do that using our paragraph variable up here which is now holding all of our classes so we need to specify our paragraph variable which holds all of our class names and then we need to again specify the actual node that we're targeting and then we're just going to use the style object and we're going to use the property color to change the color of the text so let's go ahead and run this and if we hit the submit button our text is changed to red okay that's going to do it for this tutorial in the next tutorial we're going to start to change things up and we're actually going to start working against this second bullet item right here we're going to create some brand new text and replace some text and do some various different things that you can do with JavaScript to completely alter the text on your web page see you guys in the next video
