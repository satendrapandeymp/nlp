what is up everybody welcome to your thirty-eight tutorial I'm going to do this entire tutorial singing song no actually I'm not but anyways and this is Sora we're going to be going over something called fixed positioning it's the last positioning that we have to cover in fixed positioning is actually a lot like absolute positioning and the idea that you're going to have a coordinate in your top left point on your screen and just like absolute positioning it's going to move the element absolutely where it is but the one and the main difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning and it's actually the only difference is whenever you scroll your screen if you have an element that's absolutely positioned and you scroll your screen down that element is you know going to do what you expect it to do and scroll off the screen but with fixed positioning that element stays in the same place on your website and it doesn't move so it can scroll over other texts or you know it's just going to stay there and no matter how hard or how fast you scroll it's not going to move so this is kind of a weird type of positioning but um and by the way I just want to mention this this is the most uncommon type of positioning hardly anyone ever uses this I never used it when I built a website um but I have to tell you guys about it because I just can't you know skip over a topic so let's go ahead and make a bunch of paragraph so paragraph and ending paragraph and let's just write um I am The Sandman let me in easy Metallica something like that it actually says I'm ah the same Anil me and so let's go ahead and paste this a couple times and let's just go ahead and copy this paste there and hey why not a couple more so now just go ahead and why am I doing this well I'm just want to have a website where we can actually scroll down so now you can see we have some stuff to a scroll and it's not just you know one paragraph or something so actually let's go ahead and change up this first paragraph and make it something with the ID let's name the side the tuna and in the paragraph will just write like to not make tuna man mucuna they should definitely make a McDonald's sandwich called Mik tuna I will need it sounds disgusting but I'm just saying they should make it so now let's just go ahead and apply some styles to this ID actually I already got my style tags how convenient so now in this tuna ID what do we want to do first of all let's go ahead and give it a border of like border two pixels solid and Corrine I guess why the heck not something that's easy to see and now position let's go ahead and write fixed just like that and now let's go ahead and give it coordinates so you're beginning to see that this is basically the exact same is absolute positioning the only difference is that instead of absolute rewrite fixed so now let's go ahead and give it left 65 or 64 pixels who the heck cares save this refresh and see what we got now our first paragraph is in a box that's hmm I prep it should move this over more but I'm not going to wait too lazy for that that sixty pixels down from the top and 65 from the left so exactly like absolute positioning it takes a box and it positions it absolutely on your webpage exactly where he told it to but check this out the only difference is when absolute you scroll and this could go off the screen it would slowly move up whenever you scroll this it stays fixed on your webpage just like that so no matter how hard I scroll try to get it off it just staying there and it's annoying so anyways like I said people generally don't use a whole lot when making web pages because I mean have you ever been to a web page and just did that in BEC yeah there's a reason I scrolled to get you out of my sight and you're still there you know so anyways I just wanted to go over it because I mean it I thought it was appropriate so anyways that's the difference between absolute and fixed it's one difference but it's a big difference so I guess if you wanted to be a real idiot then you could do something like this go ahead and delete that and then just go ahead and write fixed border and write like one pixel solid gray and I got an idea for the top let's put it like 55 pixels and for the left let's put like two hundred and ninety pixels so I guess if you were a jerk you can just refresh this and there'd be they load the web page and then they would see this dot on the screen and like oh man my monitor scratch is it or is it the web page and then their scroll down and see that that dot actually stays there and they're like oh well I guess my monitors just scratched so anyways if you wanted it to be you know addy head you could do that I'm just saying so anyways that is the beauty of fixed again I guess that's actually the only reason you would ever want to use the fixed positioning if you want to just make a fake scratch on the monitor so yeah I know it's dumb but hey it's all I got so anyways thank you guys for watching this story and the next tutorial have no idea what I'm going to be going over but it's going to be amazing so anyways like I said thanks thanks for subscribing thanks for watching my videos and thank you for just being you so anyways I'll see you in the next video
