okay we're picking up right where we left off in the last video with the innerhtml property now in the last video of course we were writing out new text new content in this video we want to use inner HTML to read our content in and then we want to add these two sentences so I've altered our web page a little bit here I put hit submit to combine these words so what we want to do is take the text from our first paragraph at our second paragraph and then add them up and put them in this third paragraph that I've created for this video and so again we're going to use inner HTML to read the content of both of these paragraphs and then add them up so let's go over to our JavaScript and I'm just going to copy and paste the code in here and I'll explain it all so what I've done here is I've created a variable called first paragraph text and that's named appropriately of course and again same thing we're doing the last video right we're going to go against the node of the first paragraph and we're using the inner HTML property now notice what's different here we're not assigning a value we just ended it with a semicolon and so we're reading the contents of the first paragraph which is in this case is the text and we're just assigning it to this variable same thing for the second node we're just reading the contents with the inner HTML property and assigning it to this second pair of text and then we've created a third variable to add these two together and of course we're going against the third paragraph which is identified by node number two and so again we're adding these two up right here and then hopefully we'll get a complete sentence that'll say hello there from the moon once we click on our button so let's go ahead and run this and let's see what happens here and if we hit the submit button there you see we get our new text in our third paragraph and it added these two lines now what if you wanted to just get rid of these lines well we have to use any HTML again to write out a blank statement and we can actually do that so let's go back to our JavaScript code and I'll just copy and paste some new lines in here and we're going to use inner HTML again right but this time we're just going to write out a blank string so we are writing out here we're not reading this time but we're writing out a blank string with no text and so the these two lines now should disappear if this works correctly and again we just re specify the nodes that we want to update so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully now we'll just have one line which will be paragraph three so if we hit this submit button there you see now we have is the third paragraph which is all we wanted it combined the first two lines from the first two paragraphs and gave us our third paragraph and got rid of the first and second paragraph so this looks a little bit more normal okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
