in this video we're going to continue along with JavaScript syntax and specifically we're going to take a look at loops and even more specifically we're going to take a look at while loops now loops will look very familiar to you if you have experience in other programming languages now loops are very similar to if statements which we covered in the last few videos when we talked about conditionals and loops do something very similar they are testing a condition that condition has to be true or false if it is true the block of code will get executed if it is false it is all over but here is where loops are different than if statements if this condition is true it will execute this line of code and it will loop around and then test the condition again and if it is true it will keep going and so that is the difference between if statements and while loops while loops will keep executing it as long as it is true until it hits the first false condition and then the loop exits out of the program so again that is the key key difference now you might ask well what if this condition is always true then you get into what's called an infinite loop scenario and that is not a good scenario because you'll never get out of this loop but it'll just keep going around and around in a vicious cycle and the rest of your program will not run so this has to eventually test out false or again you will have an infinite loop and the way we do that is we set up a counter and we'll do that in a second but first let's set up the condition and we're going to say I which is less than 5 so as long as I is less than 5 this condition will be true now the first thing that we need to do is create a variable called I and so we'll do that right up here and so we're going to say I equals 1 and this I stands for index our index will start out at 1 and so if we executed this now while 1 is less than 5 and so this would be executed but we would still have an infinite loop because this would loop around and I would always be 1 so we have to change the value of I and how do we do that through an incrementer which we talked about a few videos ago and so let's put that right down here and so now this will get incremented by one each time this while loop runs so let's just walk through this so we define the variable I here and started it out at 1 the loop will get executed it will be true because I is less than 5 the block of code will run and then after that this will get incremented by 1 and so it will come around here and this value for our variable will now be incremented by 1 to 2 and it will go all the way around till it reaches 5 and then obviously 5 is not less than 5 and the program will terminate it at that point so let's go ahead and save this and we'll flip over to our web page and let's go ahead and run this in Chrome and there you can see we got the expected results we got four sentences of a statement has run it didn't run a fifth time because again five is not less than five and that's what we expected okay that is going to do it for this video in the next video we will continue on with loops and we will take a look at one of the more popular loops that is used in JavaScript see you guys in the next video
