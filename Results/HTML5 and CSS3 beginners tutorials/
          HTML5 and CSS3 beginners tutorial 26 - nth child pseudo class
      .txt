hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number 26 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about the enth child pseudo class so a lot of guys have actually been requesting after my previous uploads that I make an NHRA video and actually to tell you the truth did plan on making this video before the requests but now that you guys have actually requested it I thought I would just hurry up and get it done okay so if you guys are new to HTML and you don't know what the nth child does then basically it allows us to style every other element on the webpage so in other words if I had ten paragraphs I could turn every second paragraph a different color or if I had a row I could or table sorry I could turn every second row in my table a different color and it would just make things a lot easier to read for the user so just that's something that we can use the enth child pseudo class for so let's go ahead and actually get started and I'm going to create a parent div just for styling purposes and neatness and I'm going to call this div parent for no reason other than the fact that it's going to be the parent div of all of my paragraphs okay so now we can go ahead and create a paragraph and the content is obviously not important for this tutorial so let's just write something random like I like green eggs and ham okay so we've basically got one paragraph here I'm just going to duplicate that a few times so I'm just going to place my cursor before those paragraphs and hit ctrl D a few times and let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and we'll make an even number 14 okay and if we run this in Firefox now there's nothing special about this it's just 14 normal plain old paragraphs but let's go ahead and actually style them and make every second paragraph a different color so to do that we can go over to our CSS page over here and just select all of the paragraphs inside of our parent div so we're just going to use a child selector here so parent P and basically this means that get go ahead and get all the paragraphs inside of the div parent which are all of these and then let's go ahead and grab the enth child so entirely just means how many you want to grab and you're going to put then you are going to put in these parentheses over here okay and this is actually going to be an argument that we have to supply to CSS and I'm just going to go ahead and type in the keyword of even or you could go ahead and type in the keyword of odd they will both work obviously one will change the odd paragraphs and the other one will change the even paragraphs so let's go ahead and actually just style these paragraphs so I'm going to go ahead and give them maybe a background color of gray and a different color so let's just give them a color red so now if I go ahead and save this and go back to Firefox and click refresh that actually looks hideous but we now have every second paragraph has a different background color and some red text although that red text just doesn't vary very well change that to blue or something probably also going to look bad but hey okay so like I said we could use even or we could also use the keyword of odd and that will grab every odd paragraph okay and support the other thing we could do is instead of giving the keyword of odd or even we could give this a pattern to follow so let's say we wanted every every second elements to change color then I could go ahead and supply the argument of 2n over here and that will change every second element so the first element didn't change but the second element now has these this blue color with the gray background and if I go ahead and change this to four in then it would go ahead and select every fourth element instead of every second so one two three four that one style one okay one two three four and that one style so that's also one way you could use this and lastly I just want to let you guys know that if you just put a number value in here over here so if you don't include the N then what happens is HTML will only select the fourth element in that list or in that group so let's go back here and click refresh and as you can see one two three four so this has been styled and then nothing else after that gets styled so if you want the pattern to be able to repeat then you have to actually include that in and if you don't want it to be a pattern just go ahead and supply a normal number with no end and that's how to use the nth child pseudo-class so hope this video was helpful and of course and as always don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
