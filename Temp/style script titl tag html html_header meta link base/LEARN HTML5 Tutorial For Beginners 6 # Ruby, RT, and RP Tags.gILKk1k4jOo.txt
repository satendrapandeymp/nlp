hi friends welcome to the channel of learning by doing today I'm going to talk about some more attacks of history will fight and I'm going to open my notepad here oh not today I'm going to talk about a new tag which was introduced in his shame will fight that is nothing but a ruby tag Ruby tag what is mean by Ruby tang instant in the sense the Ruby tag is mainly used for the is it was given like a pronunciation to some of the letters I mean like if you want to know about the Japanese language or the Chinese language whatever the languages that you want to know we want to know the soundings of it right a small text that was up written upon the biggest main text I mean we are going to write the capital A and how it's going to pronounce that we're going to give the phonic phonic or anything phonetics or anything the soundings upon that it was nothing but this will be tagged I'm going to show you how it's going to work the Ruby tag is also having also stats as are you be why Ruby within angular braces and it's going to be int width / or Ruby why as usual as an ending tag in between this Ruby tag beer this Ruby tag is going to be followed with to the to another tax in it called the RP tag and apt attack what is mean by the anti tag and the athletes hag is nothing but if you want to displace a move the content end up I mean I want to display some Chinese language and on upon it I want to display some phonic political soundings on it then that displaying with political soundings meaningful soundings which we want to give to it is to be in between the RT tag and RP tag is going to be a just all the look at how you want to look it up on it or outside of it on these things that i'm going to show you it let the small example regarding this a RP and this i'm going to show you / our parent at the track is also having the ending tanga / r 3 and i'm going to show one thing for my age phonetic sound as i will show us just molly and sushi i'm not having any chinese languages or anything to display for you guys but it is useful for any some other languages which one i feel i want are using the telugu have the pronunciation of the telugu will be going to display here and this will be gets closed okay / happy that's it and if you are in this manner we see the we'll see how it's going to be the output and i'm copying this again and i will show it another example as what are we going to write it here then z okay see said the phonetic sound as see whatever I mean I'm just giving one example I'm not particular about it will be having this sound itself I'm just showing you had how it's going to be look that's it and i'm going to show you another tag which is called the text area tag i mean if you want to give some text area for our web pages where we can give some content in it how can we give it as by using the input tank i already said you but I'm again stressing you bodice input tag and input tag we are having the too many many attributes Florrick I'm gonna introduce some of the attributes I already said to you about the two attributes that is type and the value and now I'm giving the type as a text type and we are having good another one as the value I'm giving the value as 1 2 3 4 5 whatever that is and if you want my text area i'm in mind text box should be displayed in this much sighs and this much maximum length should be there and all the some of the constraints should be there somebody for somebody who we are having the two more attributes like size that is Phi or anything whatever you want and for that the maximum length should be this much and all these things if you give something entrance maximum there are many attributes for this I am giving only some of the attributes which is easily get understood by you and this is about the input tag and I'm going to tell you another type of tag for you could call it the another ball Amina and okay okay let me tell you one more attribute within this input tag that is we are we are talking about the type value size maximum length and all these right and if you if I want to give them some more I mean like password for my input a text area man in the in the text box how will you give it the password should not be seen by any other right because it is it is not shown figure so for this and the input tag it says we are having the another type of attribute where have we can give I mean if er here we are giving the type as text right we can give the type as password itself if you give the type as button or if you can give the type as submit if we can give the type as submit and all this it will work and I am giving the type as password then from this we can see we can we can give the password to this at the password letters whatever you want to enter in the text box will be get when does not disclose to anybody it will look like Harvick we look like starts right you're all known start letter going to my or dots whatever you want i'm going to save this and i'm going to see how it's going to look okay guys i'm going to open my chrome and i'm going to reload it again see I'll you I'll use the break here then you will get to be understand well they are you break here okay an algebraic here also see you guys just understood here i'm using the Ruby tag and also i am using this input.text tag which is going to give only text area i'm in text box and below this i'm using the password type as a password so whatever the content we entered in that text area doesn't disclose to anybody i mean that isn't shown to anybody see our features was going to be work or not okay i'm going to reload it again what happened did I see you did okay so you did but what is ok ok guys let me tell you pay or that term I'm going to zoom this I said to you right Ruby tag if you want to give something like Chinese language or any language that you want to be doesn't even known how they are going to write and it doesn't even know how to pronounce them for that purpose they are introduced a new tag called the Ruby tangle it is consist of the two follow-up tags within it it is RP & Art Attack RP ain't art attack within it and the of what we want to display as a phonetic sound walls in between the RT tag itself ok here I given as a as a phonetic scientist sinus yay and for Z die given as sounding small text area as C so it displayed here and for the next term I have given this text box area here I'm going to display this text box area and i'm going to write here blah blah blah thing ok guys and why this was stopped here i'm typing it again and again but it was topped here what why what is the cause i have given only the maximum length as 3 i'm in maximum length astray as one of the attribute within this input tag did you seen i hope you observed it sooo so if you given the maximum length as three or four that much amount of character so is going to be display and i'm going to give some members there will it with other it will stop there itself and then the next input button i have given the attribute type as password so i'm giving here my password see I'm giving the password but it is going to be display as dots thanks for watching this video if you
