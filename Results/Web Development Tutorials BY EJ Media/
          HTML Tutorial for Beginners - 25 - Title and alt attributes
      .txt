in this video we're going to talk about the title and alt attributes within HTML now we'll first talk about the title attribute now it used to be in HTML 4 you could only place the title attribute in particular elements you were restricted in terms of the types of elements where you could place the title attribute but in HTML 5 they change that and you can basically put the title attribute in any element tag that you wish so if you wanted I don't know why you do this but you could actually put it within the HTML root element tag you could do that but for the most part usually you're going to put these inside an IMG element or a paragraph element something like that where content is actually displayed on your web page and what the title attribute basically does is it creates a nice little tooltip when you hover over a particular HTML element and in this case when we hover over our Caesar image we should get a nice tooltip and so let's go ahead and put that in here and all you do is type in title for the title attribute and then we need to put in some text and in this case we'll just say Julius Caesar so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and now let's hover over the Caesar image and there you can see we got our nice tooltip Julius Caesar now later on in CSS and especially jQuery we will actually format this tool tip and make it much more presentable now let's talk about the alt attribute and basically that stands for alternate and it's alternate text for an image so what it really allows is in case we can't display this image for some reason say we have the wrong path or the image is no longer there you can display alternate text so that at least something is displayed and so that's why you would use the alt attribute now you should use text that is relevant to the image that you're trying to display so we wouldn't put Alexander the Great here we probably should put in Julius Caesar and so that's what we're going to do so we go ahead and type in alt for alternate and then we put in whatever text we want to and in this case as I said we'll just put in Julius Caesar now we have to actually change the name of our image here so that it doesn't load and then we will have our text from our alt attribute displayed so we'll put a 1 here on the end let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see our image is no longer displayed but we got the text displayed from our alt attribute okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video thank you
