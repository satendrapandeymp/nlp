hello everyone this is me again in this part of this tutorial I'm going to start working on my CSS file in the previous tutorial I basically typed the boxes that I need to create a website that looks more or less like the one I have here in this image in this wireframe what is important here is that I have created different divs right every deeth has got a name names are very important once again just keep them relevant make sure your names make sense and make sure you remember that these names are the same that you're going to use in your master CSS or in your CSS a file write important spaces please know if you are using a uppercase and lowercase that's fine that's valid but remember that uppercase and lowercase are different so please be very very organized with this alright so I'm going to start with my wrapper here which I create a div ID wrapper I close it right down here now I'm going to make sure it has the right size and color so I'm going to type here number sign wrapper and then I'm going to type which which is 1024 pixels H is going to 768 pixels and background color I'm going to have a chronical blue color that's alright I save it now if I test if I preview my website in Safari I should be able to see when to refresh please ah then I have my wrapper although it does not have a content it's there right so there is a banner here there is a column here basic content there is another column and there is a banner that footer sorry that are there but we can't visualize so far okay so I'm going to I'm going to create my menu my banner sorry my banner is going to be Donna my banner is going to be with 1024 pixels 8 is going to be oops I'm going to check my image because I don't really remember sorry about that 220 pixels 220 pixels and I'm going to put a background color and this background color is going to be a lot on an orange and I save it and I'm going to test my website I'm going to preview and refresh always refresh command are please refresh there you are you have your banner and then you have your wrapper which is basically containing every single element right now I'm going to go I'm going to style my menu on the top so I'm going to may type here menu top remember capital T and I'm going to say that my waves I don't really need to write the wings because in CSS this is inherited but doesn't do any harm hate I'm going to type 35 pixels and a background color background background color is going to be again choose any other color that's alright for the greenish color that's alright and I'm going to save it now if we preview this this is what we have the menu oops sorry the menu is just going below my banner which is basically what I want to do right so so far so good it's just looking the way I want um now I'm going to create the next one which is for my column left alright so my column left my column left then to check the size to 24 38 okay so this is going to with 220 pixels 8 for 38 pixels and the background color is I'm sorry the background color it's going to be 20 kind of brownish color brownish color okay now I'm going to save this I'm going to take a look I'm going to take a look at this and I'm going to preview in Safari so now I have my banner I have my menu and of my left column is just looking fine I think so that's alright um the next step I'm going to style my column right and this column right is going to be basically the same I can copy and paste back to issue and I'm just going to type here with 220 pixels a pate 438 pixels background color a background color um just a different color right and I save it and I'm going to test now you will see what is going to happen here ah this basically is placing my right column at the bottom of my left column which is not what I want so I need to play around with a couple of items first item I would like to play around here is rolling the float and I'm going to float this to the right hold these two right I save it and I'll have a look again on my right still not looking the way I want but I'm going to float my left column I'm going to float my left column to the left so I think that should look they are so floating these to the left of your view layout and floating these to the right of the layout you just give us the right appearance here right so the next part is going to be our arm content right content make sure you are using the right names for you thieves and for your CSS so the width is going to be storage need to check online to 24:38 okay no it can't be 220 this is going to be 584 so there's a mistake here is 584 438 okay so it's 584 584 pixels 8 438 pixels and the background color the background color is going to be pinkish color I'm going to save I'm going to take a look at this preview in Safari right so now what you can see is that this is also placed in my content on the left I could do that but I need to push this slightly towards the right exactly 220 pixels which is the distance between my column and my content so I'm going to go into my master CSS and I'm going to type a margin left 220 pixels and that's it I'm going to check again that should be alright I refreshed and that's it so so far it's looking you know looking the way we want now I need to put my footer which is the last part so I'm going to type here footer open and close with loops with is a one one oops 1024 pixels a is 75 pixels I think she's going to double-check yeah 75 that should be right and the background color background color again choose a different color here probably kind of dark green save it and test preview again and there you are this is the way you start building your website as you can see is not that difficult is looking exactly the way not the way I have it here so I think we are on the right track here right again what is important here names which is important here be very careful be very organized if you are having a problem just double check see maybe you are ignoring Collins or semicolon so you are in knowing some parts of the syntax here like sometimes people make mistakes with this which is which is very common so just double check make sure everything is OK and preview your site if it's looking good good enough and I think that's all for now in the next tutorial I will clear this little bit up I'll make it sure that it looks slightly better but once again from now it is looking the way we all want I think that's all for now so if you have any question drop me a line if you have any question we like to comment send me an email I'm very happy to help you out thank you
