okay so let's get started with HTML in this section we're going to discuss things like what a doctype bays are going to discuss tags and you know case uppercase lowercase syntax just different stuff like that so you need to have some kind of text editor available that you can use you can use like simple text or WordPad or notepad or something like that it's really easy and when you type in and I happen to be using Adobe Dreamweaver it really doesn't matter you're going to be saving the file with a dot HTML extension so I'm going to go out and do a save as and just save this in a folder and what I want you to do and what we usually do for websites we create a folder for all of our site stuff and this is called a root folder right there site and you call whatever you want it doesn't really matter when you go inside you usually see a folder called like images or something to that effect and that's we're going to put oddly enough our images and some other stuff and then we put up pages out here but the idea is we stick everything in a single folder each page is going to be separate HTML file and we put a dot HTML on the extension right here you can see that so that we can tell what's an HTML page and the browser knows it too all right I'm going to save this index as I mentioned before is the first page of a website so we're going to call it index dot HTML now we're in a text editor let's say and I want to get started here you're going to notice that as we work in HTML there's a lot of kind of things to think about first of all just some some rules with HTML we have what are called tags ok and a tag looks something like this and I'm going to actually make this a little bit bigger for you so let me change the preference here don't mind what I'm doing I'm going to make this bigger ok so a tag looks like this a tag essentially is an HTML thing that you can use that's already been predefined and there's a whole listing of these things that you can use in your page to mark up your content to tell you the browser essentially what something is like HTML means well this is an HTML document i would suggest when you type these little tags in here that you type them in lower kids because you're going to find that sometimes it's necessary you have to do it to be what's called valid it doesn't mean it's going to blow up a break in a lot of cases but it just it's good habit to get into if you want to learn like what kind of tags are out there there's a lot of websites you can go to the w3c org is one of them this is another one that I like HTML can calm and they have an HTML reference and these are the different tags that you can use so these are all the things that you can essentially you know mark your content up with and tell the browser hey this is an image as an IMG stands for you'll also find that there are tagged references for different flavors of HTML and we need to talk a little bit about that too the w3schools com which sometimes is pretty good has an html5 tag listing and these are all the tags and it shows you ones that are no longer used in this version of HTML and the new ones that's kind of interesting to look at anyway all right let me go back over to Dreamweaver when you create tags most of the time you're going to be usually wrapping them around some stuff some content okay a tag starts with what's called an opening tag oh so this HTML is right here a closing tag looks like this it's got a forward slash Dreamweaver is going to finish these for me it's kind of cheating it's being smart anyway so we have what's called an opening tag and we have a closing tag it's sort of like a like a light switch you say hey HTML starts here this is HTML thing whatever is right here is going to be HTML and then we've got the clothes or the end of the HTML so if I were to type in hey there that would say that okay hey there is inside of the HTML tags which means whatever they say the browser says to do to HTML like font size color whatever do it to this stuff right here inside the opening and closing tags they are upper or lowercase rather I would suggest doing that as far as putting in the tags in there you'll also find that some tags you don't actually close or what are called self-closing this is kind of weird these are called void elements and we'll talk about these a lot like suppose you want to put an image on the page well the image tag and you always start with this little less than symbol is IMG now to close it I'm not going to do this you're going to find that we're not going to do something like this store sometimes you just don't do this to close the image tag it actually looks like this this is called a void element which just means that they're nothing can be inside of it there can't be two tags and some stuff between it like the HTML right appear so you'll find that there's only a few of these there's like break image horizontal rule things like that will run across some of them as we go most of the time though you're going to create an opening tag and a closing tag sort of like this all right tell you what let's get started here I'm going to start out with the most basic page we can create you're going to see that we start out with an HTML tag okay and there is going to be something that goes before this I will describe that in just a few minutes here but let's start with the main part of a page here so to get started we go with HTML and then we're going to put a closing tag the thing is with HTML we can make it easier to read by hitting a bunch of returns I'm hitting the return key right now and putting in let's say the closing tag and keeps doing this closing tag down here and expecting that a bunch of stuff is going to go right here in the middle so just leaving a big open gap we could type it all in one line it doesn't matter you can tab these in as much as you want it it doesn't really matter it all gets stripped out essentially okay so with an HTML page we start with an HTML tag this says hey browser this is HTML the next thing we do is we include a to the two main sections to an HTML page we have a head section and we have a head tag and we open it and close it just like every other tag and we have a body tag so I'll open that and close that if you want to follow along by typing go for it okay so you guys can type all this stuff in now let's talk about what's called nesting and parent-child and all this crazy stuff when we create this HTML tag we're saying that anything in between this tag right here and this tag down here is part of the HTML so if i put in these head tags the opening and closing it's going to go in between these two is to say hey the head is part of the age tml documentary the HTML tag with HTML you're going to get used to this pretty quickly you really really well the head tags are called nested inside of HTML you'll see the HTML is also called the parent of the head tags okay too much I'm just going to leave it alone for now so we have two sections we got a head section in a body section in the head section we will typically put a couple things will put stuff usually that people won't see but the page uses things like styling or a link to styling we'll put like scripting or link to scripts stuff that the page can't do we'll put information for search engines up here in the head we'll also put in a title so the first thing we do is put in a title here in the in the head the title tag which whoops looks something like this title open entitled closed and the title could be just about anything you want usually it's information about your page and this is what shows up at the top of the browser window so it's pretty cool this is like one of the only things in the head that actually shows on the page so most of this stuff is going to be hidden and it's going to be just used by the page the body is where your main design goes so in the body if you were to go into the tags here and let's say I like press Enter or return and type in hey there that's going to show up in the browser on the page as a matter of fact if you want to test this out which you can do is you can save your page and making sure that you've got the dot HTML extension you can go to a browser if you want to and usually go to like file open file or something like that and if you're using Dreamweaver there's a quick you know go to browser button but click open file go to my desktop let's say and grab that file wherever it is my folder there it is right there the HTML page open that up and it should open it up for you and you can see that we've got our title right here usually on a tab or at the top and there's our content right there kind of cool all right let me go back over to Dreamweaver or whatever editor you're in and those are the main parts of a page sort of the main structure and syntax of tags we're going to be talking about a lot of different things here to go as well like scripts and you know things like that but the last thing I want to talk about with just our getting started with HTML is what's called a doctype if you come up to the top up here where we have the HTML tag and you hit a return put your cursor up there and hit a return our pages need to have what's called a doctype now a doctype is a document type definition for short or for you know long rather i should say and it basically tells the browser or whatever is reading this code here i can see could say what version of HTML you're using and it's got to be at the top of the page these things look something like this let me show you a couple examples here's what an XHTML doctype looks like now there are different flavors of HTML and I'm sure you've heard of these before or if you haven't there we go you've got HTML for XHTML one you've got html5 we've got HTML 321 that kind of thing but most people are going to use either XHTML or html5 this is what XHTML looks like as far as a document type it's called it's sort of like a no this little bit of code here and you're not going to memorize this don't worry this bit of code just tells the browser hey it's an XHTML page it's transitional and there's a couple flavors or several flavors actually which means hey transitional means give me a break if I screw up like if I use a font tag don't break the page if this were to say strict right here if you were to use something that a XHTML didn't support it would really wouldn't work in a lot of times it would invalidate it's called it wouldn't be valid HTML 5 this is what the doctype looks like now html5 is new I'm not going to talk a lot about right now it's going to be the very end we'll talk about it but this is stuff that is really is going to come into play you know some people use it now I use it now but it's it's got some some nuances to it that some people just don't like to begin with okay html5 is a way for us to go in and add some new things there's new content that we can work with new semantic tags and different things like that but if you're just getting started and we don't want to have to deal with working all these different things you can use this doctype right here if you look right here at XHTML or HTML rather you're also going to see this thing right here called xmlns xml namespace this thing needs to be in the HTML tag so if you guys want to you can pause the video and copy this down you can also copy it from a billion different websites as a matter of fact if I show you one here let me see the w3 schools w3schools doctype you can go and search for this HTML doctype declaration there we go and they believe give you here we go common doc type declarations you'll see that we have the one we want to use right now in the beginning is XHTML 10 transitional so you'll see it right there you can copy this and paste it in your page above the HTML tag if you want to go with html5 which is new and you know there's some things that you need to do to get it to work for IE or an Internet Explorer you can use this all right I'm go back over I'm going to copy this and put it on my page copy go to my page and paste it right there there we go now the HTML tag itself has to have this is going to be called you'll see this is actually called an attribute but we're not going to talk about these yet it's this right here xmlns alright so if I copy this and you can just pause the video and type that in what I want you to do is we're going to go into the HTML tag here right here put your cursor after the word HTML press the space bar space make sure there's a space here and you can type into some xmlns and I got an extra space there and type this in this is necessary for XHTML to work to validate I should say okay so a doctype is something that we want to put in our pages so in case we want to validate validate literally means that we're going to check to make sure that things are working properly into tags are working and everything's hunky-dory and working okay and you can validate just to show you real quick just point this out using something like the w3c markup validation service it just checks to make sure your tags are working like you didn't screw it up like type in instead of a head you type heard or something like that so it just gives you an idea of if you're going in the right direction if it's valid or not okay anyway this is getting started with HTML this is that the basic initial stuff that we need to have this is probably the most simple page that we can create creating doc types and things like that I'm going to save the page the next thing we're going to do is we're going to take a look at and intro to CSS styling
