hey guys welcome to what I believe is the 12th knowledge Highway HTML tutorial today we're gonna finally go over metadata the most fun subject ever in the world actually most people probably skip over this it's useful though it's very useful in getting your search results higher on Google and all sorts so it's just good for any search engine related stuff but also other things so let's get started and write out our standard oh sorry yeah our standard template kind of thing that we've been using for the last little while gonna add a hitch tml element to tell the browser that I'm using HTML and a head element because we're gonna be using one of those don't you just love that I type the closing tag before I type the opening tag because I'm preemptive like that oh goodness yeah it's kind of difficult to type with that having my microphone right in front of me and not being able to reach the keyboard because I have to reach around it anyway now that I've gotten that little task out the way let's I don't know let's add like a little bit of a little bit of something just so there is something to look at because there's really not much to see when you type in metadata anyway um hi close tag so I'm adding a heading element with a heading one element with just the word high in it and the paragraph a paragraph element which I'll call hello world cuz that is fun and original you can make that a capital H because I'm going all OCD up in this so there is our starting page all of this which we already know let's go for it hi hello world hello HTML document let's add some metadata so what is metadata what is this term that I've been tossing around well I'd give you the exact definition it is data on data to say that in more humane kind of terms it would be information about data and in this case we're talking about information on the HTML document so um meta tags are used to provide information on page description keywords authors dates modified all that kind of stuff so it's good stuff to have and as I say they are used mostly by the search engine but occasionally by the browser in terms of instructions on what to do very few cases where that is the case though but I will go over a couple of them today so yeah let's start off by adding our first meta tag so type in the word meta and then we'll close it and that is a meta tag right there but it's kind of useless in this state because it really doesn't tell us anything so what if we want to tell the browser exactly what character set we're going to be using in this document now some of you will be asking what is a character set well that is basically a list of all the different types of letters and symbols that will be used in most cases you will use the UTF one which contains tons of different symbols I believe it includes all sorts of languages as well and not all the fonts will have Chinese characters and Japanese characters and all that maybe there this no I don't know yeah not so good on that side of language but anyway um yeah so it basically tells the computer what how many all the different symbols that are going to be used or defines them and you can also use other things other than UTF like I think you can use ASCII actually but not many browsers will support that also I so don't worry if you don't know what any of this means you could either google it if you are questing for knowledge or if you don't care you don't have to care because you're always gonna be entering the same thing in here 99% of the time so let's enter that thing in so let's add an attribute called car set which is basically what I've been talking about this is where you set the the character set to use and we're gonna type in the one that I was just talking about which is UTF dash 8 now this is the absolute standard and I wouldn't deviate from using this so whenever you're making your webpage and you're thinking you're done and you're ready to add in all those final meta tags just so the browser can find you you might want to throw this one in just for good measure just in case someone's using some strange browser that doesn't know the character set or does not have that as default so now that we're done with that useless meta tag that should only be used for reasons of completion and professionalism let's talk about one that you might actually want to use oh gosh my phone is ringing sorry picking up where we left off we're about to do the meta keyword tag well the meta tag with the keyword attribute so let's go ahead and do that meta as our tag name and the first attribute is gonna be name now what does name do that basically is the name of what we're going to apply content to or the it's like for example if you had a document this would be the name of the document and then we're going to write inside of the document after we've given it its name the name for keywords as would be expected is keywords so let's type keywords as the attribute between the two quotation marks now this when the browser sees this or the in fact no it's more likely going to be the search engine when the search engine sees this it's like allow all these keywords that they have listed must be what this website's about it must represent the main list of things that this website covers how do we put those tags in or rather keywords well we use another attribute called content I'm going to set that equal to in between quotation marks and then you can just list whatever keywords you want your website to have so for example if you had a website about games you might type in games and you might type in Playstation oops station or Xbox or Nintendo all those things may go as keywords so just whatever relates to your website or the webpage that you are creating would go in there why did I delete that we may as well leave that up there so let's save that and we should see no changes because these are this is meta information this is stuff that goes in the header that does not appear in towards the user but if we right click and go to view page source if you're using Firefox you can see that there is in fact it's still there and if for example Google and if you know how Google works basically a quick summary and it has these little things called I think it's called spiders is what they call them but they're basically it's a little program that goes through all the web pages that it can get its little hands on via links and it goes through them all looking for these types of lines and when it sees one it's like oh so this is games PlayStation Xbox and Nintendo are all associated with this web page so it updates its inner database with those tags so you are then telling Google that that's that's what you want and when someone searches for Nintendo you're more likely to appear higher up on the Google search results or whatever it search you're using Bing or whatever um the thing is you're not gonna see an immediate result if this does happen if you put these in and you're like why is Google not like updating why is it not suddenly why am I not the one that's number one for Nintendo my I've got the tag in there well two things first of all it takes a while to update and also they're gonna be hundreds of thousands of websites with Nintendo in there and also the keywords there's only a very small aspect to their overall algorithm I believe but it's good to have in there nonetheless it might get you up a couple of places um so let's go over some similar kind of things I guess so let's add another a similar method tags so oh yeah as I was saying with the analogy the name is like the name of the document so keywords and the content is whatever goes inside it using that analogy so let's make another meta tag and let's type name equals a description that's another one that is the script rune oh my goodness this is another one that is commonly used in websites and it is used to describe the contents of the website Wow that was completely unexpected I know basically when you search for it in Google again we're just gonna talk about Google because Google is obviously my favorite website considering how often the reference it may be not my favorite but anyway you'll see under the name of your website where it comes up with the result it'll have like a name and then it will have a description whatever description you enter in here will light most likely appear as the description on Google as well or whatever search engine I think if you don't put in a description then it will just quote a bit of your website or something I can't remember entirely but in this example we would say loads of fun information formation about games and such and then that would be the description on Google yay so a couple other ones meta name equals and we're gonna set the name attribute equal to author this time read and then let's type in content as another attribute and this time I'm gonna type in joules three cuz that's my name yay ah so that's that's another one that one's self-explanatory that just sets the name of the person now there are a few other ones like this there's quite a few different names that you can enter other than just keywords description and author and but I'm not gonna go over all of them because there's an endless supply and I don't know because this is one of those things that you generally look up when you need it you'll find out what different meta tags you can put in to make it more obvious what your website's about and so that's going to do it for that section let's now go over one last thing on meta tags that I'm going to teach you meta tags are pretty extensive there's more to them than just this but not much more than this so this is just about everything most other things are either redundant at this point or you just wouldn't generally use them anyway final thing that I'm going to teach you so I'm not open another meta tag yeah you can get really full up with meta tags really quickly by using them and this time I'm going to add an attribute called HTTP - equid equity refresh so an attribute equal to in quotation marks refresh now I'm going to add another attribute to that and it's going to be called content as we've been using so far and as you know the content is where you specify what any information relating to that tag once you've named what it's about in this case we're talking about how often the page should refresh so let's tell it some information about that how often should our page refresh now this is done in seconds so to make this easy see I'm going to set this to two seconds so that's basically it I mean let's talk about that again because I kind of rushed over that and didn't make much sense of it so we've opened a meta tag and we've get it given it the attribute HTTP - equivalence telling the browser okay I have this instruction for you it's that you should refresh that this page wants you to refresh and then in the content we're saying how often it should refresh and this is in seconds again I've done two seconds and this should work and http-equiv - equiv can be used for a couple of things and but we'll go over another one in a minute there's a few others that are again redundant at this point so I'm not gonna talk about them so let's go and hopefully it will refresh there you go okay so this is gonna be very difficult to see but every so often every two seconds it should be you'll see this flicker you might not even see it on the capture because it's loading so fast this would be much more obvious on a real webpage also you can see this flicker - a cross look very carefully and you might see this is far more obvious on a web page on a web server where it actually has to load more than just a bit of text as well but take my word for it it is refreshing over and over and over again so one final last thing which is basically an amalgamation of a couple of meta tags which would be I'll actually add something else I think you would generally put this above everything else let's replace that that's not that will just confuse you further but this tag is going to make this tag kind of redundant the character set one because we're going to set the character set in this one and it's the same attribute so you could really just do this I'm basically just trying to show you you can do two things in one so I'm gonna add another meta tag and I'm going to take HTTP - equid ye qwave equals and as their for the attribute I'm going to type content - type now we're going to add another attribute called content as we have been using before and here I'm going to type text slash HTML now this looks an awful lot like M what we have seen before with the whole linking deal well it's the same thing it's just basically telling the browser that all this webpage is HTML code it's kind of like another thing on top of doctype I think duck type really is more about the version of HTML whereas this is just telling it straight up that this document is HTML there are not many cases where this would actually be important but again as I said before it's good for compatibility reasons and just for professionalism to include things like this however do not feel that you have to and so there's one other thing that we can do in here as I mentioned earlier we could set the character set to something as well and the way that we do this is by adding a semicolon on to the end of what we've already got in the content attribute and typing car set equals and then no quotation marks this time make sure you do not put quotation marks and type UTF - 8 now we've just this is kind of a complicated needlessly complicated line but I thought I'd throw it in there nonetheless if you don't understand this feel free just to not bother with this and just do it in two lines like we've already done but by adding this you no longer need this so it's it's nice to do it in one line but sometimes for readability you will do this over to and but yeah all this does is tells well the semicolon tells the browser okay I'm I'm finished with this instruction which is based you tell the browser that this is a HTML file and now I want to also say that this con this bread webpage has the character set of utf-8 so you've said two things in one statement incredible okay that's going to do it for this episode guys sorry I had to cut in the middle um it's just how things go sometimes so the only thing that I can think of that we really have to do now is just forms so let's that's what I'll be doing next time okay that's gonna do it for this time guys thanks for watching and see you
