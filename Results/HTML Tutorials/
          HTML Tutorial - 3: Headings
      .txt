hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 30 role in this course and in this usual we'll be talking about headings in HTML so I've saved this file and has the name tutorial - 3 dot HTML on line 1 I have the doctype declaration on line - I have the opening HTML time on line 19 I have the closing HTML tag and then I have the head section in the body section within the head section I have the title tags that contain the title headings in HTML and then in the body section I have 6 heading tags and you know if I would open this file in Google Chrome this is how it would look right so you have first second third fourth fifth sixth text that I have between the heading tag pairs you know in the body section right so we've seen how the h1 tag works you know in the first tutorial in this course and I just go through it one more time so you know to have it you have to type in h1 as your opening element and then you also need to have a closing element you know for the same heading so you have / an h1 and that - between the opening and closing angular brackets and whatever text you have in it it is displayed in bold and it has a greater font size and the next lower level heading is the h2 heading and it's the same as h1 in you know in construction it's just that you use the number two instead of number one and you know that has to happen for the opening tag as well as the closing time right and then similarly you have h3 h4 h5 and h6 and there is no at seven so you have six different levels of you know of headings in HTML and you could change the default size you know through CSS but you know since we are not going to cover CSS in this course you know if you want to have any of these six levels of heading in your documents and you can use you know the heading tags right so that's all I wanted to talk about in this tutorial I assume the next one in which we will discuss another interesting feature of HTML and I hope you guys had fun and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I see you in the next video till then take care
