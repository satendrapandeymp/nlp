in this video we are going to continue on with media queries and we're going to add multiple media queries in this video and basically what we're going to do is add another media query to handle when the screen or a device of 400 pixels or smaller is used for our web page and what we're going to do is just change the color of this box to dark green so let's go ahead and switch back to our CSS code now as I said you can add multiple media queries for as many different resolution types as you want so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this because we're going to make a new media query and we'll just go right down here and we're going to make this 4 400 pixels that should handle some smaller resolutions that encompass mobile phones so 400 pixels and what we're to do is we're going to go ahead and just get rid of this rule here we don't need that anymore because we already floated the item up here and got rid of the sidebar these rules will remain in effect because we're still smaller than 600 pixels but when we get smaller than 400 pixels we want to go ahead and change this box over here here it is we used an ID of box so let's go ahead and put that in here so we're just going to specify pound box there we go and then we're just going to change the background color as I said so we need the background color property and we're going to set this to dark green so let's go ahead and save this and let's see what we get so we'll refresh our page and let's go ahead and start minimizing our browser so there you can see we hit the 600 pixel mark and of course our sidebar is eliminated and our logo has been moved left let's go further and there you can see take a look once we hit the 400 pixel resolution the box now changes to dark green now the key point here is anything in this smallest resolution type right here this 400 pixels resolution any properties that we put in here will override anything we put in here and to hammer home this point let's go ahead and just copy and paste this into our 600 pixel resolution up here and what we're going to do is go ahead and specify dark red and I'm going to go ahead and save this now I want you to notice it shouldn't change right this will not change because we are under 400 pixels so this background color will take effect so that's what happens if you're using the same property in multiple media queries so let's go ahead and refresh this and this should stay the same and it did now watch what happens when we move a little bit further out yep see now the red will take into effect because we hit the 600 pixel mark and if we go even further out yep it'll default back to its original color which of course is dark grey so that's basically how the overrides work with CSS media queries now we have used the max width property now basically you want to use this when you're designing from the top down that is you're designing from the desktop view and you're moving down into smaller resolutions all the way down to the mobile phone now there is another property called the minimum width now we're not going to use that here but you can go ahead and play around with this it's the same concept you're just going in a different direction you're actually moving up now basically when you use the minimum width property you're actually doing the opposite here you want to design from the mobile phone resolutions and work your way up all the way to the desktop so that's why you would use the minimum width property other than that everything is the same is just the opposite of the max width so that is how media queries works we're going to also continue on with media queries in the next video and it we're actually going to create an entire new style sheet using media queries and we will talk about that again in the next video so you guys
