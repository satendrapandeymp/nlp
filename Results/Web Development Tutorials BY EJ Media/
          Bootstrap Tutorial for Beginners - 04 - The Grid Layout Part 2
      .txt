we're gonna pick up right where we left off in the last video now in the last video we set up our grid and you can see we added all of our columns we added six columns now what we've been doing so far is using bootstraps classes we use the container class and then inside that we put the row class and we use the column class to create our columns but you also will have to use your own stylesheet that's why we created this style sheets CSS as well because you're going to need to customize your own columns so that's what we're gonna do in this video we're gonna actually add our own customized classes so that we can format these columns the way we want to so we've got the basic framework in place so what we're gonna do is create an individual class for each one of these columns now you can use IDs if you want if you don't plan on reusing these at all you can go ahead and just create an ID we're gonna create a class but again you can do what you want so what we're gonna do is go ahead and hit enter here and we're gonna go ahead and add a new div and this will hold our new class and we're gonna call this call one for column one that will be our first class for this first column good and that's all we really need of course we need to close out the div again because we add in another div so let's go down here and we'll just go ahead and copy and paste that right here and let's go ahead and just move this back a little bit so it's nice and neat okay so there we go so now we've got our first column class and this is again is going to be a class that we're gonna specify in our own stylesheet not bootstraps and that's the way you use bootstrap you'll use some bootstrap classes and then you'll create some of your own classes to add some of your code so almost all bootstraps are hybrid websites they have their own customized CSS code and then they will use bootstraps code okay so now that we've got our first column set let's go ahead and we're gonna copy and paste this into the rest of our column so we don't have to retype everything remember copy and paste is our best friend we don't want to have to type everything out do we know so let's go ahead and we'll just highlight this portion hit copy and paste and there we go we've got that all set we just need to make a unique class here so we're gonna update this and make this two there we go and let's just follow that same procedure for the rest of these columns oops and I need to update the text as well okay we're done so let's make sure this all looks good 6 & 6 5 & 5 4 & 4 3 & 3 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 okay so we're good to go so now we've got six different classes for each one of our columns and again this will allow us to go ahead and customize each one of these columns in whatever manner we want to so now what we need to do is flip over to our style sheet and let's go ahead and add some CSS for these columns okay so let's go ahead and we'll add some CSS for column 1 and let's go ahead and give a margin of 3 pixels and what this will do is of course add a little space around to each one of our columns it'll give us a nice gutter so we're gonna go ahead and do that and again we'll make that 3 pixels but again you can make it whatever you want and then let's go ahead and give it a minimum height of 300 pixels so we want it to be 300 pixels in height so that will expand out our columns quite a bit then what we're going to do is go ahead and align the text in the center and then let's go ahead and give a color background color to this column and we're gonna go ahead and give this a color of silver let's start with that and there we go now let's go ahead and copy and paste this you know what we need a dot in front of this this of course is a class you can see how I always make mistakes and so that's why you should never feel too bad about making mistakes I make them all the time the trick is finding the mistakes when you make them okay so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this and we'll go down here we're gonna keep this the same but let's add a different color to column 2 you don't have to use these colors obviously you can use whatever color you want but I'm just gonna go ahead and make this green and we need to make this column too and let's go ahead and create some CSS for column 3 and we'll make this blue so this stands out a little differently and we just have three more columns to go here so let's go ahead and create some code for column four and let's make this red and we'll go ahead and create the code for five and let's make this dark green and last but not least column six well let's go ahead and we'll make this one orange how about that that column will be orange okay there we go I think we've got this all set and it looks correct so let's go ahead and hit save let's go back to our index.html and hit save there let's load up our page and we'll see what this looks like hopefully it works and it did take a look at that that looks really good see we've got this nice margin now between our columns and we've customized them the text is centered we have all these different background colors and now we can really see how bootstrap works very nicely so I'm gonna go ahead and minimize this and it should yep see look there look how nice bootstrap handles that it now created a tablet view or a more mobile centric view for our elements you can see how nicely it handles that any look it keeps the appropriate size take a look at that everything is nice and size look how it automatically adjusts the width of the columns perfectly I mean it's just perfect take a look at that and if we expand it back out then we get our nice desktop view as well all right so this is a good start I will see you guys in the next video
