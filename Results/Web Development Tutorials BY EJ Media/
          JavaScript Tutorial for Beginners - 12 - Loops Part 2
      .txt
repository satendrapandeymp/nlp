in this video we're going to continue along with JavaScript syntax and specifically we're going to look at the for loop now the for loop is a lot like the while loop and that's why I'm going to leave the code up that we used from the last video which of course was a while loop and I will just keep that commented out because I want to show you how similar the while loop in the for loop are now you'll remember that we wanted to write out the statement a statement has run four times and so we set up this condition to do just that on the fifth time it was false and then the program was finished but we got our four lines of a statement has run written out and that's what we wanted and what does that do for us well we don't have to type out this statement four times we can just have the loop do it four times for us now in terms of a four loop like I said it's very similar to a while loop here is the key difference we are taking all the statements and remember there's three parts to this there's a counter which of course is our variable I which stood for index there's the condition which is the second statement and there is the incrementer so what we do is we take all three of these and put those inside these parentheses and they go in a top-down order so this will be the first ones and so let's go ahead and copy and paste that in the parenthesis so we'll put that here then we'll take our condition which is always in the second spot right in the middle so we put that after our counter and then we need a semicolon so a semicolon separates the statements and then we need our incrementer we do not need a semicolon for the last statement and so again that's just the big difference we're just taking all three of these and putting these inside the parenthesis and let's go ahead and save this and let's go to our web page and run this now and we should get four lines of code and we did and so as I said it did the same thing that our while loop in the last video did you might ask well why would I use a for loop and here is the answer many developers find this easier to read and understand because all the statements are right here in the parenthesis we can just simply see here we've got our counter we've got our conditional and here's where we're incrementing counter it's alright there we don't have to go all over the place like we do in the while loop to see what's going on so this is much easier to understand for many developers and that is the reason the for loop is one of the most popular loops in coding now you may say well wait a minute this is pretty easy to read here but what if we had 50 lines here of code and now you have to go find where the incrementer is so I think you guys get my point so that is it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
