why hello there bloody good day and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about unordered lists so our 27th tutorial and yeah it's definitely time to learn how to style unordered lists so before we can style an oralist we probably would need 1 a so let's go ahead and make an unordered list and knit right there and add some list items in here and yep definitely mess that up so just undo that Wow I'm messing like this whole thing up there we go Bucky you get it okay that's how its constant right here enough lollygagging around Li Li time to add some list items so the first item would be like Apple I just go ahead and copy this way too lazy to type this again so okay what's on my mind Apple I guess we can make this a list of food that like apple pie and dumplings because they sound funny and they taste good mmm not bad combination so now that we have an unordered list let's go ahead and check it out a regular dumb ol list with these dumb old bullet points I mean this is a you know a nice list of food but I want to spice things up a bit I want to make this look nice and Purdy so the first thing that you might be thinking is all right Bucky the first thing that we need to do is either change these little bullets or get rid of them all together because I mean this is old-school just regular bullet holes I don't think so so let's go ahead and learn how to change our bullet points in order to do that go ahead and write your UL is the element and the property in order changes is called list - style - type now this has a bunch of default arming excuse me not default but it has a bunch of built-in things I can only remember like three off the top of my head um let's see if I can remember Square is one now if we go ahead and refresh this check it out our bullet holes turn to squares that's that's probably really hard to see on YouTube but I assure you they are squares let's go ahead and make something that's a little easier circle I know is one that might be a little easier to see circle see now you can see that instead of those are filled in bullet holes there now nice elegant looking empty circles so that's pretty cool and actually I just thought of another one um I don't know why I thought of this but it's called katakana and you got to say it like that you just have to I didn't make the rules and if you refresh this you can see these I don't know I guess they're like Chinese or Japanese symbols if anyone knows what those symbols mean then I'll leave me a comment below because I uh well obviously because I don't know what they mean I want to know so anyways that is the basics of how you change your unordered list from regular double bullet points to something else so another thing that I want to mention is if you go through and you see you know you look on the website and you go through look into all the bullet points that you can use and none of them really um tickle your feathers I guess nothing really make you happy you can go ahead and download an image or make an image and use them as your own custom bullet points so I went ahead and I already downloaded an image off the internet and it's just cool little check mark and if I wanted to use that instead of my bullet points here's what I would need to do first of all you don't use a list style type anymore so go ahead and delete all that what you use is property called list style image and of course anytime we want to use the image and CSS we use the keyword URL with those parenthesis in inside our parentheses I have a file that I already download so if you do this it's not going to work because this file isn't on your computer but anyways I already have this in my folder it's called check dot ping so when I go ahead and save this and refresh is going to go from katakana to those cool little check marks so now you can see instead of those bullet points it has like my own custom whatever I want so I just want to show you guys that there is a way to uh you know if you're not happy with anything they give you by default then you can make your own so another thing that I wanted to cover in this tutorial maybe I'll save this for next door now we have got time to do now um let's go ahead and delete all of this and add a property like border one fix solid red this is a problem that I had a long time ago and I remember that every time I made a website it would annoy me so I always use unordered lists when I have like a navigation bar on the side and the first thing I want to do is this first of all on my navigation bar I don't want these little bullet points so in order to remove those I go ahead and in my CSS I go list-style-type and i set this to none and I'm thinking are a whenever I do this the bullet points are going to disappear in all of these which would be links are going to be pushed nice and neatly to the left but I refresh and I get this from I have this huge space to my left even though there are no bullet points I just want like shake my computer and I'm like dude you don't have any bullet points so you don't have to move over so can you just hop over there where you should be go ahead just hop on over but it doesn't do that in order to get those to the left let me explain this first of all by default your browser gives padding at least left padding to unordered list um it also gives a margin I believe by default so in order to fix the padding I mean you would think that it would be zero by default because it just makes sense but it isn't in order to fix the padding you need to explicitly set this to zero so go ahead and type padding in there and go ahead and type 0 and now once we go ahead and save this and refresh it check it out everything is pushed nice and neatly to the left and of course if this is too much for you you can alter the padding accordingly but I just wanted to show you guys whenever you guys are you know making a website in your like hmm making an unordered list as a navigation column seems like a good idea and you have this problem well now you won't have it anymore like I had so I shot myself in the foot so you guys won't have to so anyways that's all I wanted to show you guys trying to save you a little headache at least umm so there you have it so thank you guys for watching this tutorial um I don't know what I'm covering the next story but like always it's going to be amazing so anyways thank you guys don't forget to check out my website and I'll see you guys later
