hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML div tag vs HTML span tag and we understand when to use HTML span tag and how it is useful so let's get started I go to start type here notepad and then I click on notepad here I am going to write opening HTML tag and closing HTML tag we know that hTML is divided into two section opening head tag and a closing head tag indicates the head section opening body tag and a closing body tag indicates the body section in between the head section I put the opening title tag and say span tag demo closing title tag then I save the file with the name as span tag demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and click on the Save button you can see that span tag demo dot HTML page got created at the desktop I do open with the Firefox and see how it looks in the browser you can see that span tag demo dot HTML page got open and title is set to span tag demo now we proceed further here we are going to discuss div tag vs span tag right div tag is a para tag beta tag means there will be a separate opening div tag and a separate closing div tag so I am going to write here opening the tag and a closing div tag similarly span tag is also a pair tag so I have tried opening span tag and a closing pantac next difference is div tag is a block level tag span tag is an inline level tag that means we are going to discuss now how the div tag works and how a span tag works here I am going to write opening div tag and a closing div tag and then in between I am won't write hello HTML exclamation mark as div tag is a block level tag do you remember I discussed about features of block level tag block level tags are going to put content always on a new fresh line and they also take the entire available width on the browser that means this div tag what it does means it puts hello HTML exclamation mark on the new fresh line here and it takes the entire available width on the browser window let me show you that I say file save guru browser and refresh you can see that hello HTML exclamation mark are displayed on a new fresh line and also you should remember that it takes the entire available width which is free now for example I am going to use a style tag to put some styles on div and show you that it is taking the entire free available width so I am going to write style tag here now we know that style tag is a pair tag so I have tried opening style tag and a closing style tag and we must try and should write the style tag in between the head section and we can use one attribute with respect to style tag we have a type attribute to that we can give a value as texts or CSS that indicates that whatever we write within this style tag is going to be a normal text or a CSS code here I am going to tell to the browser that locate a div tag in the current page okay locate every Dave tag in the current page and apply the background color background - color of science ey a and science semicolon now what happens when I save and refresh the page means div tag is going to have a background color now file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the background color syan is set to this much amount of area why because as I told that block level tags take entire available free width that is you can see like div tag has acquired this much amount of space on the browser window remember that div tag as it is a block level tag block level tags are not going to sit one beside another they always want to sit on a new fresh line I did and also they do not want someone else to sit on the same line remember that now if I write one more div tag here and say hello HTML exclamation mark and a closing div tag what happens now is this hello.html exclamation mark will get display base this fellow HTML exclamation mark no as I told that block-level tags do not like to sit beside of another tab they always put the content on new fresh line and they take the entire available width so what happens this hello HTML exclamation mark content is going to be displayed on the new fresh line and it takes the entire free available width here if i refresh you can see that hello HTML exclamation mark or displayed on the new line and it has took the entire free available width hope you guys have understood how the div tag behaves now I'm going to explain you about the span tag I am going to write here opening span tag and a closing span tag as it is a paid tag and then I write here h-e-l-l-o hello HTML exclamation mark if I save file save good browser and refresh what happens as I told that block level tags are not going to allow any other content to be seated beside them so as this hello HTML exclamation mark has took entire available free width this hello HTML exclamation mark is going to be displayed on the new fresh line so if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that hello HTML exclamation mark or display on the new line because this cannot be fit over here as it is an inline tag let me tell you I'm going to copy this and paste it now what happens this hello HTML exclamation mark is going to be displayed beside the previous hello HTML exclamation mark because inline tags takes only that much amount of space which is required to display the content available in them so this man tag takes only this much amount of space so as this space is free this hello HTML exclamation mark can be fit in this place right so it will get display over here only you can see that I just say file save your browser and refresh you can see that inline tags are going to put content one beside another from left to right top to down they don't move the content to the next line hope you guys are understanding and I can show you here I am gonna say span and I write here background color BAC k gr o UND background - color I said to pee i NK pink and semicolon now what happens now you should see this hello HTML exclamation mark is going to have a pink color and this hello.html exclamation mark is going to have a background color set to pink file/save go to browser and refresh you can see that from here to here it has took pink background color here to here it has set a pink background color you can see this part the freely available space on the same this line is having the white background color as it is so remember that time tag is an inline tag it takes only that much amount of space required to display the content available in it whereas div tag is a block level tag it takes the entire available width it never let someone else to sit beside hope you guys have understood what is the difference between div tag and span tag in the previous tutorial we have already understood that div tag is used to group various tags inside and help us to create sections on a web page div tag is used to divide the web page into various sections it is a container tag it is going to work like a container to hold some other tags and apply styles on them now when to use a span tag we are going to talk now for example here I am going to write hello HTML exclamation mark and I say file save go to browser and refresh looks like this I write one more hello HTML exclamation mark and I say file save go to browser and refresh looks like this of course I want to put a break between them so I am going to use a break tag and if I say file save go to browser and refresh we know that the content is moved to the next line automatically I copy this and paste it down I'm going to copy this for two more times and if I say file save go to browser and refresh content is going to look like this now I want to apply some styles on these hello.html exclamation marks for example I want to display the content bold so I need to use a BTEC opening B tag then I am going to write a closing B tag file save go to browser and refresh you can see there's this hello.html exclamation mark or displayed in a bold similarly I can do the same thing here I can write opening B tag here I can write opening B tag here I can write a opening B tag I am going to write copy this paste it here paste it here paste it here I say file save good browser and refresh all are displayed in pull now I also want to display all these hello.html exclamation marks using underline so I can write here opening you tagged so I can copy this content and paste it over here paste it over here paste it over here and I close the you tag because you tag is a pair tag I'm going to copy this and paste it paste it paste it now every hello.html exclamation mark is going to be displayed in bold as well as underlined refresh you can see that bold and underlined I can also display in italic format by using the I tan right here I can write opening I tag here I can write a closing I tag similarly I'm going to copy that and paste it over here paste it over here paste it over here I copy this paste it over here paste it over here paste it over here I say file save your browser and refresh you can see that all hello.html exclamation marks in bold italic as well as underlined I want to apply the font color also though I have to use a font tag right so I read opening font tag and I set the color to maybe red suits dropper and I want to perform that for every hello.html exclamation mark so I copy that paste it paste it and paste it and I have to close the font tag right so I like closing font and I copy this content and paste it here paste it here and paste it here I think I made a mistake or here everything is perfect file save go browser and refresh you can see that all are displayed with a font color red bold italic and underline can you see this we are repeatedly writing the tags in HTML 5 the latest specification it is recommended that not to use font tag not to use u tag not to use B and I tagged to stylize the content instead of that we should use the CSS Styles font tag and you tag are deprecated deprecated means you can use the tag but it is recommended not to use so font tag is applicated you tagged is deprecated I tagged and be tagged are going to be deprecated that means instead of using the font tag we have to use CSS cascading style sheet to apply styles and also you can see that I have to copy paste the content and again and again to apply these many styles if you are interested to apply more than one styles to a content instead of using HTML tags if you use the span tag and apply styles that reduces the amount of code and you can control or manage the code easily let me explain that instead of all these tags I can use a span tag only one tag you can see opening span tag and here I am going to write a closing pantac I must time should use the break tag to display the content on the next line because span tag is an inline tag similarly I am going to copy this and paste it over here and paste it over here and paste it over here then I copy this paste it over here paste it over here and paste it over here you can see that I have reduced a lot of code here and then show you how it looks without any style refresh that is how it looks now you can see that we have the content displayed by using the span and break tags now I am going to tell to the system locate the span tag and apply the full brown color or a text color to red semicolon file save guru browser and refresh all spans are having now red color and then I say here F 2 NT font - w e IG HT font weight of bold and if I say now file save go to browser and refresh the text is displayed in bold format you can see that similarly I'm gonna say font sty le style italic I said file save go to browser and refresh you can see that text got displayed in italic similarly I can say text - decoration to underline semi colon file save your browser refresh all spans are now having red color displayed in bold italic and underlined you can see that how much go we have reduced by using the span tag so you can use a span tag when you want to apply more than one styles on a content and it helps us to reduce a lot of code and if you want to change suddenly like I you do not want the red color you might be interested to blue color you can just change here to blue so if you change the color to blue here and say file save go to browser and refresh all content are in blue now if I have used the font tag then I needed to change in every font tag go to every font tag and change the color value to blue right so that problem is now reduced by using the span tag hope you guys have understood how to use a span tag and how it is helpful in creating webpages dynamic content if you want to display we use usually span tag and it is used to set more than one styles to a single content and it is an inline tag remember this all these points
