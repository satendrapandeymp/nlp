[Music] hi guys welcome to nourish a technologist this is super awesome in this video session we can view SVG html5 scalable vector graphics already in the previous video session I discussed very clear about the canvas graphics first what is the major difference between canvas and SVG can was completely working based on JavaScript SVG completely working based on XML it has a clear syntax XML namespace the namespace when we are writing is VG 11 we should use XML namespace HTTP and a mother website name ww dot dot o-r-g slash year when they implemented that and you need to write the group name so this is SVG namespace and the namespace address you open the SVG you need to close it has a different different shape let's we'll see Tirion once once we are entering into SVG scalable vector graphics it is a graphic format in which the shapes are specified in XML SVG language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics completely it is working based on XML namespace a library here we can implement graphics in different formats so far we are using dot PNG portable Network graphics dot SVG this one that before dot jpg joint pictures expert group like this different dot gif graphic interchange format these are the previous format compared to these formats our SVG is very lesser file size and a clarity never collapse at any resolution may be you can make small smaller be bigger the clarity of the picture is always excellent that is SVG caliber if you are coming to SVG features several features I wrote here it is a pure w3c standard World Wide Web Consortium approved means SVG is by default working with the rule of w3c standards image scaling means big or small just now I said smaller file size always at that point SVG tools already available best the tool is int escape dot o-r-g you can go to Inkscape and download rating scale software you can try different different kind of graphics with free of cost SVG images can be such is really index in it and scripted and compressor yes easily we can do all these things if you compress also there is no issue SVG images can be printed with high quality all at at that point I made at any level means at any size at any resolution level compatibility any browser compatibility and any platform compatibility at the same time any device compatibility accessibility anybody can access search engine optimization we can simply search engine-friendly disease yes these many features available and iframe level also we can use I'll show you practically that SVG syntax just now I wrote already xvz namespace and w3c dot o-r-g mm the ER when they implemented a squeegee concept and SVG library for example whatever the syntax just now implemented in front of you this syntax now these are library you can just copy it one few copies go to your browser try to open that library what exactly opens we can observe yes namespace directly w3c and it is opening w3c dot o-r-g and the version name is VZ and scalable vector graphics the latest version is 1.1 version and 16 August 2011 it is released and it has a lot of content completely if you come down all the way and it contains completely about SVG components so all these components at least we can try to work a minimum thing and now we can up we can come back the previous wherever the syntax are implemented we can write a different different shapes for example we can see a rectangle shape our ect now generally rectangle existed width I said 200 pixels now once 200 pixels if I say that and you can say height equal to 100 pixels so rectangle with available height available then I can I can say this one now if i close SVG close that and i am executing by default what color it is playing sv the rectangle displaying with normal one black rectangle hedging I kept already now if you come back you want to make sure this one little bit bigger yes 300 pixels I said yes so whit I increase now you want to make this a heading colorful and we are writing commonly that kind is SVG level means which one level style is V equal to color blue little bit colorful I am making and you want to make sure that font family also I want to change yes font family and I am giving the home save it and refresh it now rectangle level already colors available here what is the syntax means fill is equal to red s particular you want to bring a stroke stroke is Z equal to I want to provide a stroke of green means border and border coming or not we can green border so different coordinate also we can apply here for example X I am begging is equal to 10 pixels I said now come down and ten pixels we can observe right run it X now why also I want to move little bit Y is equal to 10 pixels I want to do right y is equal to 10 pixels now for example radius I want to change radius X is equal to 20 pixels and radius equal to stroke rx equal radius X equal to for example 20 pixel and a radius y equal to 20 pixels now we'll observe that so once we are coming to here and radius so wherever cut down that little bit width I want to decrease to file zero right perfect okay a picture so like this different different kind of rectangle shapes we can able to design for example I want to design about SVG circles yes circle and circle having commonly circle x coordinate is equal to I said hundred pixels I am giving hundred pixels for example circle why I am giving 60 pixels coordinates as you like your adjustment and I'm not giving any fill all the things by default black color circle yes circle and you can do that circle information level correctly circle X circle Y but where is the radius radius equal to Phi zero pixels perfect now black and white color now you want to change this SVG circle heading also you want to change change it so come back now you want to increase or you want to change the color again fill attribute is there with you you can change it yes completely graphic say now simply we are design you can observe all our syntax based even a single JavaScript related statement I am not writing all our shapes and predefined shapes all these are so if you are working with canvas canvas Beauty different and it can was enhancement easy customization super but your wear has come to SVG level it is XML based all are predefined so pre different shapes predefined properties available so these are only we are using so customization little bit critical in SVG level now we can come back to here and Stroke also I am using stroke is equal to for example I said green color once if I say green tell yes for perfectly visible that now you want to increase yes definitely for example I said six zero if you are going to be yes and upper level you can see this cutout and a little bit why you can increase then it will be adjusted right perfect adjusted now the same thing I want to work with for example ellipse and its level we can try to e ll IPSC L it's CX CY and 3x cy yell it's and circle difference are having only radius and it's having radius x coordinate radius y coordinate now radius x i provided like this 80 for example and radius Y also I required so radius Y I am providing and 45 pixels right we can see how the shape is one shape design we can change because I need to show you where I modify so directive shape is available you want to concise you want to bring a bogel time okay right will change for this adding also tell you now once ellipse changer for example I made this 155 observe or why I change please observe looking like a circle so ry for example I am going Pat if I observe perfectly no oval so when we are decreasing that correctly oval shape for you and for example rx is there I am increasing you will observe that so if I am increasing so x width is increasing so like this ellipse multiple ellipse also we can able to design same like this we the lines available if you are coming to SVG line for example lines in packs line syntax is x1 comma y1 means x1 starting position y1 starting position of the X is with Y is hype and x2 comma y2 x2 ending position 200 I am taking y2 ending position I am taking again 200 again 200 now I am going to refresh that SVC line now Lion existed now I want to bring SVG line here yes so stroke also green eyes that weekend I want to increase in stroke width available there is a property weekend so in this video station I made very basic level as busy concept as we see a rectangle with a different properties as we see circle SVG ellipse fvz line thank you for watching my videos more videos please log on youtube.com slash narrating [Music]
