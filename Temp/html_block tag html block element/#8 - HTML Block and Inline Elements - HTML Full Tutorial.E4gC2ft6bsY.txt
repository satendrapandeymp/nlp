[Music] all righty guys it's a meet here and welcome back to dev dreamer now in this lesson then I want to talk to you about block level elements and in line level elements now in the previous lesson we looked at the paragraph element and the heading elements as well for that we'll see h1 to h6 elements now those two are known as block level elements and basically all the HTML elements will come with a default display and for the most part that's going to be either a block level element or an inline level element now what do they above me first let's take a look at block level elements so let's go for a paragraph element which is which is block level and let's just type some in here now you might not see it but this paragraph element actually spans the whole width of this page and that's because block level elements do just that based on the whole width on the actual page so even if I were to increase the size of the browser window here this paragraph element is spanning the whole width now whether we can see that visually on the actual page it just by doing some CSS styling so they just go to our CSS file and select the paragraph and I'll just say outline one pixel solid red this is an important to know we'll look at CSS further one down the line this is just so that we can see the actual outline of our paragraph element okay so as you can see then this really does span the whole width of the page and if I increase the size of the page you can see it still does the same thing and I said that's because the paragraph element is known as a block level element that is its default display it's the same thing with h1 as well that would also be a block level element now the other thing these know but know about block level elements is that they start on a new line so before we look at another block level element let's take a look at inline elements so an inline element is basically an element that only uses up the total amount it actually needs so for example an inline element we're going to look at in the next video here's a span tag so in here let's just type in let's type in the same thing actually every map for the inline element this only takes up the exact amount it actually needs so if you were to put an outline on the span tag as well so I'll just go here as and span and I'm gonna copy this cuz I'm lazy save and as you can see with the inline element with our span span element it actually only has a width equal to the text inside okay and the other thing about the inline element is that they start on the same line so if you were to add a second span and then here and we'll just type in just say hello as you can see it's started on the same line and again it's only taking up the amount of the width that it actually requires if we were to include a block level element here you'll see that it won't start on the same line it will start on a new line and it will take up the whole width of the page so let's go for say h3 then I am on a new line as you can see start on a new line and let's just start this again it should be easy if we just do this and again guys will get CSS a bit later on down the line and but essentially then it's done the same thing so as this was a block level element it spanned the whole page now there is another type of display element called an inline block so it's sort of a mixture of the two and that basically allows us to add a width and a height onto our span elements so at the moment if we try to style this span element in terms of the width or height you see that it won't take effect so let's just take a look at that span and opposed to say let's increase the height of all these spans it's increased height to say I've not hundred pixels nothing nothing has happened that's because you cannot style inline elements however if this was an inline block level element then we can have this particular styling so it'll come to here and just do display:inline-block you can see now is actually increased by well 100 pixels okay and again guys I really want to stress we'll take a look at all of this bit later on down the line when we come to look at CSS okay so that's it for this lesson nice I hope you've learned something new hopping down to some what block of elements are and inline level elements in the next lesson we're gonna take a look at this span tag in a bit more detail and we'll also be looking at the comment stack as well and as you'll see that's going to be very very useful especially when you're sharing your call with other people so thanks for watching guys I hope you find it useful please like and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one
