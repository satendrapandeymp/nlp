hey what's up guys today we're going to link functions to some UI button that we just made so whenever we click one of those is going to call a function inside of my code and then change my scene so without further ado guys let's get started okay so first let's look at what we currently have in our project so I have a total of three scenes this one is what I call the ground level this is the space level and this is my menu scene so ground level and space level are actual levels and my menu is just it's simply going to be some kind of level selection now I'm going to make my level selection script using UI buttons and to do that the first thing I'll do is first I'll remove what I actually done before and I'll create a new script this one is going to be called a menu script but it could be called pretty much anything it can be any kind of script as long as you just put a reference to it a little bit later on and I'll show you exactly what I mean by that but first let's go ahead and create ourselves a script that does just what we said so in order to change a scene in unity what we do is we call first let me just create a function real quick so let's make this public public change scene so it's going to be a void public void Chinchin which is going to take in parameter a string scene name and what I want this function to do is whenever we shoot a string to this function it just simply look for that scene and load it so in unity you do application dot load level and then you pass in a string or int in our case we pass in DC name okay so this is the function that whenever I click a certain button I want this function to be called so I'll show you exactly how you do that first you only that script somewhere on your scene you need you'll need that script to be on an object for this video I'll simply put it on the main camera so it's always available so I'm going to drag and drop the menu script remember can be called anything and I'm going to drag and drop it on top of my main camera so now my main camera has that script okay now as for the buttons I'm going to right click in the our key UI and create myself a button now what happens is if you don't have a canvas it's going to create a new one and there's it's also going to create a event system which is required if you want to be able to well pass event to your UI object so if you want to be able to click on buttons you need that in case you just want to make it static you why that is therefore uh I guess art purpose you don't need any action on it you don't need the event system okay so whenever you edit the UI you want to be putting your scene in 2d so you can properly see what's going on and over here I've created a button now I'm just going to resize it a little bit put it in the center and maybe to give it a width of 300 by say 150 and this button right here I wanted to redirect me to the ground scene so what I'll do is I'll modify the text inside of it and I'll say load ground scene okay and then I'll I create myself another button that I'll move a little bit to the right and this is going to be the load space scene just like that of course you can move them around edit it as you wish so I'm going to put them around here and now if we press play what I want this to do when I click on load ground scene is I want this to call the change scene function and give it the parameter I want so ground in that case because my scene is called ground ok now first off since we're changing scene we're going to need to add them to the build settings so I already have ground in there I'm going to add space and I'm going to add menu ok now using the button element the button component inside of our button object you can modify stuff in here so normal coder can change a button color you can customize it as much as you want but what we're really interested in is the unclick event down here okay so the list is empty what we want to be doing is hit the little plus sign and then it's going to ask us for an object so we want to choose whichever object that has the component menu script then that manuscript has a function called change scene in our case so if we take a look at this we just put our main camera which contain all these components to transform the camera the GUI layer the flare audio listener and a menu script we just put that in here and we get the exact same result over here as well so we're interested in a function that is inside of menu script so let's go over here and then we're going to find change scene just here the reason it pops up is because we have a public function if it was private we wouldn't be able to use it right here okay now if we if we go back to our function we can tell that it takes in a string parameter which is the same name now we have to write that exact same parameter in this little box here in our case since we want to load the ground scene and the ground scene is called ground we're simply going to put ground in there we do the same thing for the number two button I'm just going to fix the text real quick all right so number two button we put the camera in here so main camera and then a function I'm interested in in a menu script then change scene and space now let's hit play and let's load the ground scene and it does exactly what we wanted to do so guys that's pretty much it that's how you work with buttons that's how you link a function to them okay so if this was helpful to you please leave it like if you have any question or comment please leave them in the comment section below also
