what's going on guys is a CH again I think this might be my last video of the night we're here with our fourteenth video or introduction to HTML and CSS and our last video we talked a little bit about CSS on our index page which we refer to as on-page CSS or internal CSS in this video I'm going to show you about off page CSS or external CSS now for this video we were gonna source our style dot CSS page that we created two or three videos ago the one with reset CSS syntax and then copied it into our CSS file but I keep saying syntax if you guys never heard that before it's just another word for code I probably should have established that earlier off in the videos but yeah you can use a ferny language syntax is in HTML PHP JavaScript Ruby whatever okay so now I'm gonna show you how to source in our style dot CSS page so let's go over here you can delete all that information from the last video all that stuff we had in here so remember in the first couple of videos we were talking about our body tags when we're all our content goes and we're all the information that we wanted our browser to recognize go in the head tags up here well that's exactly what we're gonna do it because we're gonna create a link in our head tags that source in our style dot CSS file so to create a link in a directory in HTML this is the tag structure that we need we need to link per F which is different than 1/8 ref which connects web page to web page a link for that connects your index page to your directory pages so well what did we name it style dot CSS yeah and there's a couple more pieces of information we need for the browser to recognize it recognize this we need to let it know that it is a stylesheet and we need to let it know that it is in fact text and not JavaScript but CSS and for media you can probably get away without filling in your media and your type right here but you never know how it's going read on you know it's some foreign device or in Android I don't have an Android so I can never be able to test it anyways just better be safe than sorry just fill out all the necessary information but I still think we could get source in this page without these two pieces of information right here so for the media we're on a browser we want it to be screen if we were creating a mobile device we would put mobile right here but we're not and another thing about our link tag is that we do not need to close it it's just like an image tag member now an image tag we just leave it like that just let it hang like that well a link tag is gonna source it in without a closing tag perfectly fine just like that so I'm gonna save it actually I'm gonna write something here in our body I'm just gonna write hello world now a village apart and okay so we need to go ahead and create a selector and give this some CSS on our style dot CSS folder and pulled in here so we're not gonna leave we're not gonna put anything here except the selector and I'll show you that in a second so I'm gonna go to my style dot CSS page here it is here's with our CSS reset information now I'm gonna go to the body and I'm gonna create a new selector and I'll talk about selectors in the next video but this is gonna be the second one we talked about this is a selector right here body oh well ul this is a universal selector that pretty much covers everything in your body this is gonna cover every ordered list or unordered list blockquote table we can get rid of this table now - this is the one we created a couple videos to make an example but what we need to do to create CSS for that text that I just filled it in our body I'm gonna go ahead and give it an ID hashtag we have to you have to give it this selector it says the tic-tac-toe or the hash tag and you could call it anything you want as long as you can remember it so I will just go ahead and call this text and you don't no spaces in between here all lowercase just leave it like that and now you need to open it up with what are these brackets or braces I think they're brackets and again I just want to change the color I'll go ahead and change the color to green and make sure you got an opening bracket and a closing bracket so here's your here's your CSS attribute and you need a semicolon right here you can space the support this doesn't matter give a space right there and then I'm giving it the color that I want and I need to close it with a semicolon because I lead I need to let my browser know that this is the end of a statement in any programming language you need to close it with semicolon so that should do it so now we need to let the browser know that this is what we want to turn green so I got to create my div tag or div ID with what do we create it as text so this represents the hashtag sign and this is whatever we named it so that's good right there and I'm gonna close my div tag and I'll go back to the browser reload it voila Green Village Park perfect and you see how with that at that CSS reset thing the reset that we added that we found on Google this is perfect because look there's no margins in here now remember before our text was coming down to right about here from the left and from the top so we're all set to go all our pixels are perfect and the next video I'm going to talk a little bit about the selectors and the video after that we're really gonna jump in into creating our website and we're gonna go ahead and create the header in the second video so next video selector then one after that is we're gonna dive right into our header on our home page so subscribe by page if you guys feel like it and good luck with this I'll go ahead and see you guys in the next video
