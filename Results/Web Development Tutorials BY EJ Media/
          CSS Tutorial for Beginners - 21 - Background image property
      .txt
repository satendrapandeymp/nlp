welcome to the 21st tutorial on beginning CSS in this video we're going to take a look at the background image property so let's go ahead and open up our web page now this is different from a regular image that we display on our site a background image goes inside a element and it's exactly that it's in the background of the element so this text will be in front of it and it can really make your elements look very snazzy now I'm going to use this photograph of clouds now what you can do is you can go out to google and type in cloud patterns CSS and that should bring up some cloud patterns if you want to follow along with this tutorial so let's close that out and let's go into our source so let's go to the style sheet and let's put this background image in the paragraph 3 element so we'll go ahead and do that now this is the property right here background - image and then you have to have URL and then in parentheses is where you put the location of the image now this image is in the same folder as our stylesheet everything's in our website folder so it'll just find this name now if you were pulling in an image from the web you would actually put an HTTP URL in here okay so we're good to go let's go ahead and save this and let's open up our index page and there you can see we've got our background cloud pattern now and that looks that looks pretty good I think um now let's go ahead and actually apply it to the entire body so let's let's go ahead and let's see what that looks like so we'll go up to the body section let's put that in here we'll save it and yeah you know what that looks actually even better it looks pretty pretty good but let's actually remove that we'll keep that in our paragraph element so we'll just remove that put it back in our paragraph 3 and we'll save this and we're back to normal ok that's going to do it for this video
