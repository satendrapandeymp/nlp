in the previous videos we've learned about adding rows columns and grids using bootstrap and of course we've created this nice grid and we've added several columns and we've learned how to rearrange the sizes of these and several other things in this video we're gonna add another row so let's go ahead and do that now we have these previous columns that we used right here so let's go ahead and uncomment this out and what we're gonna do is add another row so we can just go ahead and copy and paste this right down here so now we need to close this out right here so let's go ahead and do that and now we've closed this row out right here this is all self-contained okay so now what we want to do is we want actually four columns so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this last column here column six because we want seven columns now four columns in our second row so we'll just go ahead and copy and paste this here and let's make this seven and seven good we're moving right along now let's go ahead and switch over to our style sheet and we'll need to create a new rule set for our column seven and we'll go ahead and do that and let's make this seven and let's make the color of this beige make this beige so let's go ahead and save this let's flip back to our index.html and let's go ahead and make each one of these columns in our second row size three we'll make this a size three now you can play around with the different sizes that you want you may only want two or three of these but one thing you'll notice is these will display differently depending on the size that you pick so you have to play around with them to get them to fit accordingly in this case I had to play around with these and turned out that size three fit perfectly but like I said you have to play around these a little bit yourself to get the exact size and arrangement you want so let's go ahead and save this let's go ahead and load this up and there you can see look at that that looks really nice we have now a second row all of these fit perfectly and we can display whatever type of data we want and that's the nice thing about bootstrap you can add as many rows as many different sized columns as you want and you can do it very easily and you can see we just did that in about minute didn't take long so that's really the nice thing about bootstrap once you have everything set up it's really easy to go ahead and add more rows more columns whatever you need for your webpage okay we'll see you guys in the next video
