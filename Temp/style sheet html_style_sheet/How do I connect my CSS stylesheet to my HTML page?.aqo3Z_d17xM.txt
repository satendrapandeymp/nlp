you so how do I connect my CSS stylesheet to my HTML page let's have a look at these we've got this HTML page that I've been working on here and a CSS stylesheet we haven't put anything in here it's just called style dot CSS how do we connect these two well before we answer that question let's actually take a couple steps back and talk about why do we even have two files in the first place why do we even have HTML and CSS I mean we've managed to do quite a bit with just HTML here what is CSS all about what's the purpose of having the separate file here and let's answer that let's have a look at the site that we're building that the page that we're building here we've got our nice coming soon page I've got an image here and I've got you know a heading here and some text and alright that's fine let's compare it to the page that we're trying to build and I mean obviously these these look really different right well yes and no they look different ah like style why's that the colors are different let's actually look at what's actually different the colors are different the fonts are different the font sizes are different the positioning the relative positioning of of the content is different but when it comes right down to it the content the content itself is acts actually the same isn't it right you've got exactly the same image I mean it looks it looks a bit different it's been formatted a bit differently here but that's the same image it's the same text you know it's the same graphics down here it's the same content everything is the same content and that's the job of HTML the job of hTML is to provide the meaning of the web page or the document in question you're you're putting meaning the content of your page in the HTML document okay and everything else the decoration the how it's going to get laid out and the colors and all that stuff that's just decoration that's just style if you will right there's no content that's being changed it's just the style and the style is what the CSS file controls now it didn't actually always used to be like that in the day when HTML first started people used to we didn't have style sheets cascading style sheets and we used to put all of this in the same page and and you know this might seem simpler right but it's actually not because I don't know if you've been on the web lately but most web sites actually are consist of many more pages than just one single page there's like hundreds and thousands of pages that make up a website and so imagine if you had information like okay I want a dark red background on my web page and you somehow encode it never mind about how it'd be encoded but you somehow encoded that information on each HTML page so right okay we could do that right but then what happens when let's say you're you're in charge of the way of the webmaster for your company and then your boss comes in trunk comes to you and says you know what I you know I've had a brainwave I don't want a red background anymore I want a blue background and so where does that leave you well I'll tell you back in the day that left you cutting and pasting and editing the code for thousands of HTML files just to change a simple background and as you can imagine that was kind of a big pain in the rear and so what style sheets allow us to do is these style sheets this there's only you really only need one single style sheet for an entire website now in reality people often make multiple style sheets and there's technical reasons for that but this kind of beyond the scope of this tutorial what what I want to impress upon you is that you know if we were building a full web site around here we would have multiple HTML pages but we would only need to have one style sheet that would control the look of every single page on your website and believe me that's a really really handy tool to have and so let me show you how this works um first of all so let's say you wanted to somehow start building a style sheet that's going to control the look of this site this page right here what you need to do is you need to have some way that the browser when it loads your page knows where it can go find all those styles and so we're going to add a tag in here and we're going to add a tag connecting it to this and where do you think you're going to put that tag and I'll give you a hint remember back when we were talking about about the role of head versus the role of body and we're talking about how the body contains all your content and the head contains all that administrative information well telling the browser the location of where to find the style that's kind of an administrative thing right that's just like I'm a dress it's not actually going to you know that's just pointing in two different directions so I consider that to be administrative information and so that's why it makes sense to put it in the head section here and that's luckily that's exactly where it goes and so the tag that we're going to use is called the link tag and the link tag is another one of those tags that you know how remember when I said that tags always comes in pairs yes another one of those tags that car breaks that rule and it does it does the same thing that the image tag does in that it's a self closing tag like this okay just like remember when we talked about the image tag being a self closing tag there's no closing tag but kind of there is because that that backslash is still there and it's still a self closing tag and again that makes sense because you're not actually having to you're not applying this link tag to any particular text it just is it's just plopped into your head section of the HTML document so there's a couple there's three different attributes or attribute value pairs then we need to add to this link tag and the first one the first one is is really simple it's arielle which stands for relationship and we're going to put equal and then they're going this is going to be some value in here and the value for here is just stylesheet and the reason we typed that out is because we are indicating we're now communicating to the browser that hey I'm going to give you a link that you need to link to this document and the relationship to this document that this link is going to have is it's going to be its style sheet that makes sense I hope so okay so we're just saying link is coming up the really ship a stylesheet let's move on to the next attribute value pair the next attribute is called type equals and in here it's just text slash CSS and this is where you're telling the browser okay and so this link I'm about to give you the type of link the type of file it is is loops I typed a test ignore that there we go text okay the type of file that I'm going to connect that I'm going to link to this it's a text file and we already knew that right because we know that HTML and CSS files are all text files they're just plain text files and and furthermore you know the kind of a sub type of text file it is is a CSS this is a very specific type of text file it is a CSS text file so that's why we say type equals text slash CSS and finally probably the most important attribute all their literal important is the href attribute and hey we've seen this one before haven't we this href where have we seen that we saw that in the link tag yeah it's the same attribute and you'll see different attributes used in different places so here we go we need to put the H ref tag there and what do we type in here well what's the value sorry did I called it the href tag it's not a tag it's an attribute so what's the value of the href attribute in this case it's just the location of the CSS file that you're trying to link to and now it is the relative locate Bloo a relative location and last time we saw relative locations was down here right and when we talked about that but we don't have to we don't have to indicate a folder because if you recall from here if we have a look inside here this stylesheet which we had already made a blank one it's located on the same level as the index dot HTML file we could have done this differently and this this is often done with with big websites where they'll have a separate in addition to having an images folder they'll have a CSS folder and inside that CSS folder they'll put the stylesheet the style sheet of the style sheets inside there and they might have different names and maybe they have different style sheets for like mobile use or desktop or whatever and and so in that case you would have to actually indicate the relative location by indicating you know the older name / the filename but in this case we can tell it it's safe to just write the file name file name being style.css because it's located at the same location it's in the same directory that we're currently located so that works fine so this in its entirety is telling the browser hey I got a stylesheet coming for you this stylesheet needs to be applied to index.html that it's the relationship of stylesheet the the type of file it's a text file and it's furthermore it's it's a specific type of CSS text file and the name of the file a location the file just look in the same directory you're at and find a file called style that's CSS and then the browser knows what to do with that and that's it let's save that and if we reload nothing really exciting is going to happen here why well because we haven't put anything in the stylesheet but that's coming up next so that's it for this screencast I hope that you like that thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
