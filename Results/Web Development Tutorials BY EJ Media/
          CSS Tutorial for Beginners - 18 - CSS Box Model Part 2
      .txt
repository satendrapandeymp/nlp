welcome to the 18th tutorial on beginning CSS in the last video we dealt with the CSS box model and we're going to continue on with that subject now of course we talked about the four boxes there was the content which is right in here there was the padding which is the area between the text and the border and then there was a border and that's this black border we created here and then there was the margin now we didn't specify a margin but as I said the browser creates a little bit of margin on the outside so that's what this is right here between the edge of the browser and the edge of our border so let's go ahead and close this now and we're going to edit the stylesheet a little bit actually sorry we're going to edit the HTML source first so let's open that up and let's maximize this so what we want to do here is we're going to actually duplicate this class so we're going to make a pair of four here or I call this pair of four and let's go ahead and save that and now let's open up our style sheet and we're going to go ahead and copy and paste and create our class here and we're going to call this pair of four of course and let's change the color of this to black so they're a little bit different we'll keep everything else the same for now let's save this and we'll open up our web page again and there you can see now we've got two paragraphs that stand out very nicely on our web page now we're going to go ahead and start to work with margins now let's say for this second paragraph that we create we want a little bit more margin we want a little bit more space here between the edge of the page and our element so let's go ahead and close this out now and let's go down here and so we're just going to specify margin and we're going to give this 20 pixels whoops and let's go ahead and save this there you can see we have 20 pixels of margin now create some extra space around our element okay so that's one thing you can do now let's say you want to create some margin here at the hop and you want a little bit more room between these two elements and remember these are boxes every element in the webpage has a box system around it and that's what we talked about the last video of course but let's say we want to create some space here between these two elements so let's go let's close this out and this is where we're going to use some of these parameters over here so let's go ahead and specify margin - top and we'll give this 50 pixels of space and let's save this and let's go here and there you can see we've got more space now between these two elements so you guys get the idea here you can move any of these elements around where you specifically want them on your webpage that's what these properties do they allow you to get very specific so you can control where everything goes on your web page and that's really the beauty of the CSS box model okay so let's say we really want to get drastic here and let's open up our web page again let's say we want to put this element all the way we want this over on the right we want we're going to put a picture here or something eventually so let's say we want to put this element all the way to the right so let's let's actually close this out and now let's go ahead and put in margin - left let's give this a big number because we're gonna have to move this a long ways let's say this is 400 pixels we're going to move this 400 pixels we open this up and there you can see we've moved this over now and maybe we would put a menu here or something or some sort of picture so let's go ahead and close this out now the same properties that we are using here in margin are also the same property types for padding so let's go ahead and play around with this a little bit let's add a padding left property and let's go ahead and add 40 pixels to that and we'll save this will open this up again and there you can see we've got some extra space here as opposed to this side and so that's how that works okay let's go ahead and actually let's not keep that let's go ahead and get rid of that will save our stylesheet so you guys can play around with these parameters and moving elements around and go ahead and play around these yourself now there is one final thing I want to point out the box model as I said in the last video is in every single element every one of these elements has a box around it we could actually put a border around the body in fact let's do that let's go ahead and copy and paste the border from our paragraph into the body and let's make this so this stands out we'll make this four pixels and then let's go ahead and type in aqua marine that's a color again we can use I spelled it wrong there we go let's save this if we open this up there you can see it actually there's the box and you can see the margin that the browser actually adds outside of it right this is the extra margin that goes around our entire web page and so you see how the box model actually contains everything look how close it is here this extra margin as I said is headed by the browser so that's one thing you can do if you want to see how the boxes are aligned in your web page you can just add a temporary border to see how everything's lining up that's one good way to do this okay and let's actually remove that we're not going to keep that so we'll get rid of that and now we'll do a save okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video we will continue on in the next video with the box model and we're actually going to work against an image so we'll change the content from text and we'll actually put an image and use the box model and put a border around the image some extra goodies okay I will see you guys in the next video
