how's it going everyone welcome to a sort of off-topic episode compared to the previous lessons you might have seen this channel here now what I want to talk about in this episode is the fact that according to my lesson planner within the next two or so lessons you're gonna learn how to upload a website to the Internet which I know some people watching this course you might be thinking that it's a subtle way of me saying that you're now done learning HTML and CSS which is not true and it just want to get it out there that there's so much more to learn when it comes to HTML and CSS and this also brings me to another point because and again as you probably have asked you guys this at the beginning of this course but you need to ask yourself why exactly are you learning how to make a website are you just learning how to make a website because you want to make a portfolio for yourself do you want to work professionally either as a freelance web developer or as a person sitting inside a company making websites what exactly do you want to do as a web developer because depending what you want to do then you might be done after the how to upload website to the Internet episode or you might have a lot more you need to learn when it comes to web development depending on what exactly you want to work with or not work with so what I want to do is sort of give you guys a overview over exactly what you need to look into if you want to become a web develop and work with it professionally inside a company or as a freelance web developer so what I'm going to do now before I start explaining how the universe works and how you become a full-fledged web developer and that sort of thing is I want to say you're not done learning HTML CSS after learning how to upload a website to the Internet even though that is coming up really fast the reason I'm making that episode is because up until now you've learned most of the basic technical skills that goes into making a website using HTML and CSS now there's still a lot more practical examples we haven't talked about yet and it's very important we talk about how to do certain things with HTML and CSS and that's what I'm going to focus on after you know showing you guys how to actually upload a website to the Internet so just so you're aware that you should probably new what in this course after learning how to upload a website because there's going to be a lot of cool tutorials coming afterwards focusing more on the practical aspects of how to make a website so when it comes to working professionally as a web developer there's mainly three different areas that you can focus on and specialize in you have design you have front-end development and back-end development design is when you make the actual design for a website either inside a design program or creating mock offs on a piece of paper or whatever you might want to do when you create designs but these are the people who focuses on a website being usable having good user experience testing these website mock-ups out on users before they actually start coding the website so these are people make sure the website looks the way it's supposed to before you start spending a lot of money and resources and actually developing the website using code and then we have the front-end developers where the people who takes the design from the designers and makes it into something can actually see inside the browser so these are the people takes the design and makes it into HTML CSS JavaScript or sort of front-end programming languages and makes it visual inside the browser and then we have the back-end developers who takes the website that the front-end developers made and makes it dynamic so you actually have things going on in the background the website that you don't actually see going on visually inside the browser an example of this could be a login system where you have a username and a password field then a login button at the top the website when the user types in their username and password and click the login button then something needs to have them in the background the website that actually checks the database to see if this is the correct user with the correct password and if it is then lock them into the website and this is what the back-end developers take care of at least that's a small example of a very small thing that the back-end developer could do inside a website now back-end developers are usually the people takes care of servers databases and that sort of thing so right now you're actually studying to become a front-end developer now when it comes to working in a company at least in big companies you tend to specialize in one area meaning that if you're really good front-end developer then you don't need to learn back-end development and design and of course the same goes for the other fields you might specialize in one dose instead now when it comes to smaller companies he might end up in a company where they can't afford having a designer a front-end developer and a back-end developer so in this case he would actually end up making all three different aspects of web development meaning that in some cases depending on if you want to work in a smaller company it might be worth if you looked into a little bit of everything so you sort of overall specialize in in all the three different areas and the same thing goes if you want to work for yourself as a freelance work dwell but because in that case you also need to learn a little bit of everything or to get the client whatever they ask for and this is why it's so important for me to point out that if you plan to stop learning web development after you have seen my heart to upload a website to the Internet episode then it's very important that if you want to work as a freelance web developer that you explain to the client that there are certain things you cannot give them you cannot give them the design aspect unless you study that by yourself you cannot give them any kind of back-end functionality such as a forum a login system a contact form you know that sort of thing that requires a server or a server-side language so it's very important that you know exactly what your limitations are if you plan to just learn HTML and CSS now my recommendation after learning HTML CSS if you want to learn something else besides HTML and CSS when it comes to web development is to learn a little bit of JavaScript even though you don't want to specialize in front-end development still a thing you should learn a little bit of JavaScript because when it comes to front-end development or just web development in general is a very good idea to know everything what these two three core languages when it comes to front-end development in the three core languages are HTML CSS and JavaScript now if you want to specialize in back-end development then I typically recommend after learning HTML and CSS and a little bit of JavaScript that you start looking into PHP code and again I noticed a lot of people writing in the comments right now saying why are recommending PHP why not Python or why not something else because there's a lot of different languages out there even when it comes to JavaScript a lot of people well most people agreed learn JavaScript but there's also a lot of other front-end programming languages you could learn instead of JavaScript if you want to become a front-end developer but again javascript is sort of standard here if you want to be a front-end developer now when it comes to back-end there's a lot of programming languages but the most common one is PHP which is what I recommend you get into if you want to learn back-end development after learning like I said HTML CSS a little bit of JavaScript I don't want you guys to watch this episode in the old demotivated after that I'm watching the video I actually plant this to be a motivating video so you can actually see what exactly need to learn when it comes to you know different aspects of being a web developer and again when it comes to you know figuring out what exactly need to learn as a web developer I can only recommend that you try to go to a job site and search for the type of job that you want and see what kind of requirements they have for that specific position so you can sort of see what kind of skills they say you should have in order to get a job interview at the place and that's the best way to figure out what exactly needs to learn if you want to get you know that specific type of job and if you're still a bit confused about what exactly goes into the different areas when it comes to web development then I do have an episode on my channel explaining the different areas of web development occurred look into such as you know front-end back-end CMS system Co optimization that sort of thing and frameworks we can keep going there's so many things when it comes to web development and again like I said I don't want this to be a demotivating video I want the guys to watch this and be inspired to keep learning web problem because don't get me wrong what do you learned so far with HTML and CSS is very impressive it's a bit tough to get started with web development when you have never been in that sort of area or that sort of field before and it can get sort of exhausting to to get your mind used to thinking in web development so I hope you guys are proud of yourself and sort of clap yourself in the shoulder for getting this form when it comes to at least HTML CSS because HTML CSS is the fundamentals you can't continue to Java we can't continue to PSP without learning HTML CSS first you need to start with HTML and CSS so what you have now is the foundation to continue learning web development in the future which is what you guys should be striving towards at least I think so so I hope you guys enjoyed this little episode and I hope not that it was too demotivating to listen to I really hope that you guys got inspired by it and like I said within the next couple of lessons will actually learn how to upload a website on the Internet we will talk about something called meta tags and and just some general things that you need to have in order before you start releasing a website to the Internet there's some basics that you need to have inside a website that are not really too complicated but you need to have it and we're going to do that step-by-step so you can actually see what exactly need to have inside a website before we saw like I said uploading it so hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time [Music]
