hey this is Lorraine and I want to do a quick tutorial to show you how to you know change up an image or an ad and add your own link in here and even if it's in color this one originally had a link over here and since the background was white it was really easy to change but as you can see my link is now in this color down here so even if that I'm Linkous and our URL is in color it's really easy to change or the paint program I'm using paintbrush on a Mac I think paint comes with most Windows computers and if you have a Mac you can download paintbrush for free if it's not on yours anyway but all you do is go over here to your tools and pick this dropper tool like eyedropper and say this wasn't my link at somebody else's I'm gonna click on this right here in the background and you see how it changed that color to purple okay and then you can choose a tool like the paintbrush that's kind of slow or you know the spray can you do that to get rid of it or you can just choose one of these shapes which is what I usually do and just drag a square over it okay and it's gone and then all you would do is click on the T for text and then add your own link um of course you don't want that to be purple so you change the color to whatever and then place it in the the image where you want it okay and this will work you know no matter what the background is um if the background of this photo or this image was say this yellow color oh and and I'm just doing this as an example say you know link was up here and you wanted to add your own that's the same thing you know it already had a link up here and it's that color okay so you come to the photo and get the eyedropper pick that color great no matter what colored if it's a gray or orange or whatever the eyedropper will match this color Bank rump and then again just drag the square over and it's gone okay and then type in what you want click Save and you've customized that ad or that image to your own I hope that helps you some talk to you later bye
