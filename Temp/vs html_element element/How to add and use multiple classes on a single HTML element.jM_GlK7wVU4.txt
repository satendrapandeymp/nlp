hey Kristen codify Academy here in this video I want to explore what happens when we add two or more classes to an element elements in HTML can have an unlimited number of values in the class attribute as long as each value is separated by a space we can add styles that we use regularly to a class and then add that class to an element to apply styles one class I almost always create is dot text - Center and I apply the text align property and a value of center and anytime I want to Center element I can just add a class of text Center to it here we can see the two anchor elements both with multiple class attributes the first class BTN will be used to apply font size and padding to the elements then the first anchor element with the additional class of BTN danger has a red background color applied while the second element with the additional class of BTN success has a green background color applied by using multiple classes we can layer on styles to any elements we want this is also going to help keep our specificity look and just like understanding the Cascade and calculating specificity this is something you will have to practice and it will take time for you to fully understand it but you'll get better with each line you write
