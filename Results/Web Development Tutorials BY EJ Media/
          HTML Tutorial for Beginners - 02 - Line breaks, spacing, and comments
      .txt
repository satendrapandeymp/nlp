okay welcome to your second tutorial on beginning HTML today we're going to look at adding line breaks comments and spaces to your HTML code now if you follow the last video we're going to go ahead and use that HTML file we created in that video and so let's go ahead and double click that now if you follow it along we named it test dot HTML so let's go ahead and open that and here is the header that we created in that last video the two headers actually and here are the paragraphs that we created with the paragraph tag now what we want to do is we want to add some space in here between this section and this second section so we're going to add some space right here so let's go ahead and close out Internet Explorer now and what we're going to do now is reopen this with notepad and that will allow us to look at the code and so here was the first section that we created this you will remember was the header and this is the paragraph and this was the second section that we used the h2 header tag to identify and then we had another paragraph right here so what I want you to do is go ahead and hit enter three times and that should give us the space between our sections so one two three and then I want you to hit save as and we're going to save this as HTML again because after you open a notepad by the way it will want to keep it in the notepad file format and we want this back into HTML so go ahead and save that as HTML close it out and let's reopen this up and you'll notice that nothing happened here and actually I wanted that so you'll notice we didn't get our spaces well what happened there let's go back into here open this up and what happens is is that you actually have to identify line breaks with HTML code otherwise it's as if nothing happened it will just ignore these and keep going to the next section so we actually do have to put a line break here now you'll notice there's an automatic line break after each tag but if you want an additional line breaks you have to put in you have to put in the BR tag and let's go ahead and do that and there you go we now have a line break and we can go ahead and copy and paste these now you will remember in the introductory video you'll remember I talked about empty elements and an empty element does not need a closing tag so we can just put these in here and not have to close them and the reason is is because we're not putting anything in between these as we are liking this paragraph tag we're just saying hey do a line break here so let's go ahead and save this again and we'll save it again as HTML and if we go back to our test page you'll see hey look we've got our line breaks in there now so now it recognized it and we're good to go okay so let's close this out and let's go ahead and reopen our HTML document in notepad again and now let's do a comment now a comment section is used to keep notes in your HTML code that is you want notes for your code but you do not want it to be displayed on your web page in order to do that we use the less than angle bracket and then an exclamation point and then two hyphens and then we can put whatever we want here and again this is internal to the code only we're keeping private notes on our code so we'll say this is the start of the HTML code for the second section and we will start each section with a header tag and then we close it with two hyphens and a greater than angle bracket and so let's go ahead and save this as a HTML document again and let's open it and you can see the code did not show up that's what we wanted right it was an internal comment now watch what happens let's actually go back in there and let's remove the exclamation point let's go ahead and save as again and watch what happens now it displayed it you'll notice because when we took out that exclamation point it's no longer a comment and the browser now treats this as actual text so just keep that in mind if you're fat-finger it it'll actually show up in your site which you probably realize because you'd be doing some quality assurance I'm assuming on your actual webpage so let's go ahead and fix that and we're back in business okay now I will show you how to add spaces or additional spaces between text so right here let's type in test space test and let's do another save as and let's open it up and you can see there it automatically will create one space now let's go back in there and let's add a bunch of spaces here and I think you know what's going to happen but let's go ahead and do this anyways and you can see the browser did not recognize those extra spaces we put in so in order to accomplish that we have to use the following we need to put in ampersand n B SP and you can stack as many of these as you like so if we want four spaces we'll just put four of these and I think what the designers we're thinking here whereas if you put ampersand and be SP that's probably not something someone's going to actually type out so if you put that in there it will actually create a space so let's do our save as again and there you can see we got the spaces between test and test so that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next eight GML video
