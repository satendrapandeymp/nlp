[Music] hi guys welcome to narration technologies this is subbaraj today we will see a first session on html5 advanced or hypertext markup language it is one of the crazy buzzword in the market it was released in the era of 2008 but very popular from 2011 onwards and boom started 2014 onwards it is complete enhancement of HTML 4.01 behind the html5 the main goal is how to implement lightweight of applications it is a main concept to develop lightweight web applications there are several technologies available but there is only one hypertext markup language is there right now that is also at client-side this is popularly known as advanced hypertext markup language for all gadgets and widgets there is a slide you are observing on the monitor and I made different different web browsers perfect browser compatibility existed mainly for the mobiles tablets gadgets compared to Windows operating system other environments area html5 is rocking of course if you are using the latest version of Windows 10 definitely you can enjoy in all the areas it has a big list of features but before we are going to features how introduce html5 is html5 version name is html5 or anything else like that some kind of small small quotients existed you me and everybody so first let me provide solution for those questions first one is html5 original name is not html5 it is a web apps 1.0 later web apps 1.0 rename it as html5 first of all who is this and what is this it's web apps 1.0 in the year of 2004 group of organizations gathered together to evaluate web standards and they started one organization that organization name is called what WG web hypertext application technology working group it is an organization started by three companies number one Apple Corporation second one opera organization third one Mozilla Firefox or Mozilla organization these three companies with the help of w3c with the help of Google support they launched what WG organization write in that organization one technology R&D started that is web apps in the year of 2008 a great web scientist from Google corporation is popularly known as ion Hickson and I'm showing ion Hickson here you can also type in your web browser and you will get complete information related to that this is what WG organization web hypertext application technology working group the organization if you want to view just go to your website and play what WG dot o-r-g once you are hitting the website it is coming right these many things available here lots of things available just you can click any one click on a few cues you are getting lot of answers there what is what WG who started what is the information about what WG has come out the Vava hypertext application technology working group is growing community of people interested in evolving of the web it focuses primarily on the development of HTML APA and needed for web applications so it is started in 2004 as I said already Apple Mozilla and opera are becoming increasingly concerned w3c ok these are the main information for more information you can try to visit on what WG dot o-r-g right he started Eon Excel actually in the year of 2008 Google scientists who actually renamed Web Apps 1.0 into html5 name right we'll come back and mode slides we can observe what are the features available in html5 so before we are observing these html5 features and I said already what the standards exactly they implemented here they implemented completely the standards for gadgets and widgets so this is completely enhancement you can't compare even a single feature with HTML 4 once you taste at HTML 5 those many drastical unique features are the property of HTML 5 so a few features before we are going to monitor at least what is that HTML 5 now open source hypertext resources hypertext meaning we know already hypertext means specially designed English text ever web browsers write HTML 5 equal to simple equation HTML CSS JavaScript these two or three technologies combination we can say five extra generation features for modern web development exactly it is a modern web development UI technologies there is a word available in the industry this suit a terminology entered in 2011 before html5 no UI concept maybe UX available our other one available but user experience are other things different UI technologies first time enter from html5 html5 is equal to two organizations we need to remember what wz already explained w3c World Wide Web Consortium who use w3c a popular organization warner of the web who maintains actually we have standards it is a web platform it will be new standard for HTML it is also perfect one it is a new standard for the HTML html5 is currently under development as a next major version of the HTML standard so completely simply evaluated only lightweight features available html5 is markup language were structuring presenting content for the world wide web and core technology of the Internet great terminology that is is a core technology of the internet without internet nothing without HTML no web web be is not there though means meaning of the internet so like that right HTML pushes here limits of web development it is also a collection of technology standards that are emerging so in this situation in this quick situations html5 need in your points I explained very clearly and now I am coming down to write the way of web technology and just is not I can say exactly these are the ears in software industry no exact years of the development approximately I can say so this is a rough line HTML HTML to JavaScript ultimate rocking soon you can see JavaScript videos HTML 4 CSS 2 like this there are the several things available all these things completely related to rough time our rough timeline of web technologies H including 2009 html5 right as I said 2008 of course I said approximately I said offline right and I am showing one by one features and these are the features one or two or three or four weekends a number of features are there number one semantics actually need to say the first word html5 semantics these popularly known as structural elements for a better document structure these elements are categorized into three number one general semantics second one Arabic semantics third one Chinese semantics general semantics patent existed Arabic semantics to existed Chinese semantics three existed together eighteen semantics semantics aleeah's name is a structural elements these elements only the uses is better in newspapers implementation once html5 semantics entered in newspapers view completely change that point I can say very very clearly because you can observe nowadays in newspapers how simply effectively visible behind the scenes is semantics and second category is inline elements these are popularly known as block level elements right so like this number of features second one block level elements I said meter mark progress and time really these are the marvelous elements to add more functionality to the web browser what kind of functionality we are going to add we need to check that each and every tag we need to check each and every feature we need to add to the browser mark is unbelievable for example you are searching a word you are googling a word in Google or any search engine I am not I'm not saying a particular one so I'm not a friend of Google also so is everywhere and just you can type one key word the key word available available key word background color is coming hello by default mark is called ello can we change that definitely we can change with the help of style attribute and after that one meter tag when a hard-disk fill one for example ecommerce websites on developing and stocky is not their stock presented stock is ready to complete like this different different colors of widgets we can display by using mark and a meter tag and third one is a progress for example I am downloading your file I am uploading a file or I am going to provide some kind of feature like progress so that time I am using progress bar so progress bar is always dynamic by using javascript more effective practically in the next video session will observe all these things and next and fine feature is called add one set of forms related to these features there is no words behind the words we need to speak more things practically we need to work because of 13 input types what wz given 13 input types 1 1 each one is a one rocking star input type is equal to date date time day time local almost all each and every input type is unbelievable input type is if called a color you can take number of 64 million color pickers we can display and we can say input type is equal to file to upload a file input type is equal to image number range what not all these are comes under that is a reason html5 related webbie's web 2.0 HTML 4.01 point 0 and means the lot of difference is there between one and two one is completely Java street-based compulsory we need to write externally JavaScript there but whereas in html5 built in JavaScript is there 80% 20% only we need to implement with our hands so but you need to understand here very clearly the point the point is that whenever we are implementing these things perfectly we need to know one thing very clearly that is next feature is called input level attributes how many number of means more than 20 plus placeholder or placeholder is really rockin if you open any website for example nowadays world a popular website for example Facebook I am opening once you are going to see Facebook web page it is a completely full of with your placeholder feature and these placeholders are available and existed once if you are coming to here and these are the placeholders so previously we are calling as watermarks maybe you remember that name yes so that is watermark is not there right now this watermark name only we are calling as placeholders placeholder next one auto focus unbelievable your auto focus feature you can see email or phone already auto focus one cursor is blinking there right auto focus next attribute is most important required so required how much helper means it is not giving even a JavaScript line without writing that we can do perfect things that is called required required is equal to required we can do it is doing very simple thing what exactly that required is you know so required attribute is nothing but validations we can do number of things using required so required I can say one one good feature required also after that I that means of several attributes are there in there several attributes the next one is called pattern for example I want to validate one password only lowercase characters uppercase characters or a numbers particular range also we can do that so this is also one perfect attribute for the patterns and after the patterns min and Max available minimum and a maximum we can say that min and Max attributes and after that attribute is step we want to increment for example or decrement SEP is equal to 5 I said 5 increment step is equal for example I said - 5 -5 increments so like that also available so this is we are calling s panels so every input level there is a kind of name available we are calling spinners right come back to over again PPT whatever we are observing client-side storage what is this client side sir is exactly client side storage alias name is called local storage offline storage a perfect to storage things expect the unexpected client-side stories or web storage of SQL offline storage local storage different different things available here so what exactly the meaning of local storage at browser level whatever the cookie operation is there same cookie kind of operation so what cookie performs same thing and a Hansard capacity 10 mb cookie maximum 4 KB I think you people heard about the cookie cookie is a normal text file so I don't want to speak more about the cookie because cookies are right now not enforce cookies because of our security problems cookies now completely hide two types of cookies yeah two types of local storage okay two types of cookies means you are saying that generally that one session cookie and persistent cookies same like that client-side storage is two types session cookie mean session storage local storage same like that right and next one the Burkle a web worker is a JavaScript running in the background without affecting the performance of the page really another unbelievable feature I think you people will knows already clearly about the browser the browser is nothing but what one kind of lightweight software light away to software required lightweight programming that is a reason JavaScript that much demand on the market maybe tomorrow what framework will come I don't know but Java it is always king and queen in the industry because Java has been based here also they're saying very clearly web worker is a Java spreading means in html5 area also every each other speaking about JavaScript Java so Java stood in html5 area also they are not speaking about jQuery they are not speaking about angular JS y means javascript is the base javascript is kind said javascript is a permanent you are related to anyone right the affecting the performance and dedicated workers and shared workers so these two workers definitely I will show you web sockets I think if you know already chart Windows bi-directional operators we are calling actually sender receiver maybe there is a protocol available what is the meaning of protocol set of rules between sender and receiver same chart windows purpose we are using WebSockets is another unbelievable feature this one and next one is called file or hardware access taper integration with operating system what exactly this and file system ApS means what we can redefine we can write file we can append file we can delete file all operations we can do by using APA and next one is geolocation perfect because we can capture by using latitude and longitude any person on the earth next one is a device orientation perfectly so device orientation is possible with the help of and accelerators as well as guy robust a next one is called speech input yes already it is available right now open the Google Chrome web busines Chrome web browser try to view that so these are the features available semantics already starting starting a spoke about these one only after that I am coming to new form input types holidays book all aboard I provided these attributes right I am coming to next one more semantics text number email tell all that I said video audio so we need to enjoy because your words are unable to say about the video because these are the complete deeds so you need to enjoy previously how much trouble we face by using YouTube for example if you are opening a YouTube YouTube inside you must download everything purpose compulsory flash our flash related player but right now that is does not required just open the YouTube html5 will be opened videos just my videos I am going to browse from here just to fake my videos available once you are entry is and once you click on my videos and any one of my video you can select or any other faculty video you can select just

otherwise you need to enjoy again to sounds right I kept mute that and you can see html5 video player so perfect weighted right so html5 video player this is this is a perfect one and you can see several codes available here regarding these codes definitely in upcoming videos we'll discuss this just only features I am discussing in this video right audio same like that any kind of formatted supports next one graphics yes canvas and SVG rocking in the market can using canvas unbelievable things we can do so I opened one blog also for that canvas I'll show you that one and graphics and creating rendering text copying images manipulating whatnot extra at start the ratings available and graphics WebGL and SVG now if you want to see WebGL FGL related feature graphics library chrome experiments dot-com you can visit you will get all the things here so finally performance and improvement all the things available and in this video just I explained only the features and immediately
