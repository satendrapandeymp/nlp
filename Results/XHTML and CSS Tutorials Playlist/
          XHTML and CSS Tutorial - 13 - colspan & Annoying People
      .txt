alright guys welcome to your 13th XHTML and CSS tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be covering something called a colspan now whenever you make a table you don't always want to make a perfect grid you don't always want the same number of columns on every row 3 3 3 3 it gets boring and it's just not useful so maybe you want to make the table that has one column at the top in two columns in the middle and maybe five columns at the end so maybe you want to change it up a bit but from what we know so far we don't know how to do that well this tutorial is going to show you how so for example well let me do this first let's go ahead and create a table so we have something to work with and let's go ahead and make it four rows press tab table row table row so let's copy this and the easy fingers take it easy there so now we have a table with four rows in it and might as well add our little border attribute so we don't get confused now in our first row let's go ahead and add that main title across the top so let's say for the rest of this table in these rows let's go ahead and make it simple and only add two columns but for this first one we want a title big and centered and we want it to span across two columns so there's only going to be one piece of data in here but it's going to cover two columns worth of information so let's go ahead and make a table header because you know those are the pieces of data that stand out and let's go ahead and make a table about odd people and for our table header first and foremost we need to introduce that attribute called Co LS PA N and set this equal to 2 now colspan stands for column span and it says how many columns do you want to span this piece of data across well we want it to take up two columns so that's how you do that make Col span equal two and actually one other thing we can do while we're here is we can go ahead and make this a header three that will make it a little bigger and bold as well so odd people is going to be spanning across two columns it's going to be bolded and centered so now in our second row let's go ahead and add some data actually let's go ahead and add two more headers and let me just go ahead and copy this so the first column is going to be the type of people I find odd and the second column is going to be the reason I find them odd so in our third row let's go ahead and start populating the table with some data so TD TD and let's go ahead and copy this because I am a way too lazy to type all that again and paste it so the first type of people that I find out are cat people and the reason I find them on let's just write on something like seven cats is just too many because seriously people anything over like three then you're you're kind of pushing the limit there so just take it easy back off you don't need that many cats trust me they want the attention not company so let's go ahead and copy this right here and in our last row paste this and let's find another type of people um let me think loud people I find them odd and the reason I find them odd is because let's put sure turn the music up it's only 3 a.m. and make sure you spell music wrong and it looks good so we are good to go because you know at 3 a.m. really do you need be blaring your music as loud as you possibly can that's just annoying so anyways go ahead and save this and see what we got refresh it and check it out the main odd people you can see that this table basically consists of two columns one two but this main one right here we told to colspan - if you remember right there so what this did is it took this piece of data and expand it across two columns one column and two column and the rest of this was just stuff we learn before the table headers type in reason that's why they are bolded and centered and the table data which is this regular dumb old data is just plain old text left justified see this is pushed to the left everything's pushed to the left so that is how you make you know this is a pretty organized looking table it's a lot easier to read then you know if you didn't use colspan or didn't bold anything so anyways that's a useful table so if you ever are wondering hey I wonder what type of people Bucky finds odd you can go back to this and use it as a reference so anyways uh thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I will see you guys later
