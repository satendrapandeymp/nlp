okay guys people have been asking how to do HTML color codes and I wanted to know I figured it out you can't find it on YouTube so I figured I'd just make video on how to do it so what you want to do is if you have a guild like this just started it it's fresh I just did that the red and I did here's as well but I got many more colors than that I did not do that one he's actually one of the guys that helped me figure this out so I'm going to show you a message of the day now I'm gonna do a random color I can name off a bunch of different colors I got them all wrote down on the paper a red would be C ff0000 we have four zeros and I can do cyan blue dark blue light purple purple yellow lime fuchsia light silver black orange brown green olive dark purple all that stuff and they're basically really easy some of them are random though okay so you're gonna want to l2 and triangle and this little thing right here whatever the hell this is called some kind of punctuation you're gonna hit that and then a lowercase C and then they can start off different like purple is one of the weirder ones that's kind of it's got the numbers in it and light purple has numbers in it too but a basic color that I keep in my head would be zero zero capital F F zero zero and then you would space it and then put whatever you want to be that color that it's lime so if I put my name and then enclosed it with what I started out with except it would turn it green you can do the same with any other colors I will leave the color codes in the comment sections below I'm gonna put them all down there and this is how you do it really simple piece
