in this video we're going to continue on with our massive review of selectors and we're going to look at the attribute selector yet another way you can target elements and that is we use the HTML attribute now you will remember attributes just give us more information about our HTML element and pretty much a lot of people use HTML attributes in their web programming today so a lot of elements again come along with their necessary attributes now we're going to use the language attribute in this video but this could apply to any attribute href attributes source attributes whatever attributes you want to target we're just going to use the language attribute in this video and there are several different types of these attribute selectors so we're going to cover the main ones that you want to use in this video so you can see down here in the CSS spreadsheet I've got the first attribute we're going to talk about and they are always identified by these square brackets so these are always what you're going to use with your attribute selector now the first attribute selector is the easiest one you're just selecting the attribute by its type and so in this case we put the language attribute here very simple so we're saying hey all of the language attributes inside paragraph elements will be selected and if we look at our HTML page here it will be these three and so again you could put any attribute type here you want so if this was an href you would put href here if it was for a source attribute you would put SRC whatever you want it so let's go ahead and save this will refresh our page and there you can see the background color now is changed for orange we selected all three of these language attributes that came along with these paragraph elements so that's the first type and as I said the easiest one now the second one is we can actually associate a value with an attribute so let's say we wanted to target this middle one right here we wanted this value of F R so we're saying hey give us the language attribute that has this exact value F R which of course stands for French so all we do is we put the value here and we use double quotes and there you can see we're saying now give us the language attribute along with any value that has the French value in it so let's go ahead and save this or refresh our page and just the middle one is selected so again that's with a specific value by the way I will put all these examples in the description of this video so you don't have to worry about saving these I'll put them all out there for you all the examples that we used in this video now we can also match an attribute that begins with a specific value notice I use the word begin it begins with a specific value and what we use is the caret character that's what we do so we can just put that right after our language attribute so it goes right here and now what we're saying is any value that begins with Fr go ahead and select that element so now this element should be selected as well right because we're saying hey anything that begins with F are selected so let's go ahead and save this if we refresh this now you can see both of these are selected so that's how that works now the opposite of that is we can match any value that ends with a specific value and for that we use the dollar sign so let's put that in here and let's take a look at our code here our HTML code and what do we want a key off let's key off Oh so we'll say anything that ends in O we're going to select that and of course there's only one language attribute that has that so we'll put that in here we'll put the letter O let's go ahead and save this and if this works only this one should be selected right because only this element should be targeted so let's refresh our page and yes it worked because we said anything that ends in O so again that's how that works now there's also another way that we can target the value and that is to select the value that is anywhere in the attribute value and in that case we use the wild-card symbol and it goes right where the dollar sign was now let's go ahead and target anything that has u.s. in it so we'll put US and so that means that this first element should only be selected and again this wildcard allows us to select a value anywhere inside the attribute value so let's go ahead and save this will refresh this and of course our first paragraph is selected so that's how these attribute selectors work and again I will put all of this code and a review of these selectors in the description of this video
