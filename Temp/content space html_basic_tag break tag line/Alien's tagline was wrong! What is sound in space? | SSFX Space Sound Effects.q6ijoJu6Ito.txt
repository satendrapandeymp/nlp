it was the movie alien or the trailer at least the Thomas in space no one can hear you scream and like me you probably thought space is a vacuum and since sound needs a medium to travel in there cannot be any sound in space right it turns out you were horribly wrong sound fundamentally is a pressure wave as air oscillates backwards and forwards it will go between being compressed where the density and therefore the pressure has increased to being rare fight where the density goes down and therefore so does the pressure now because pressure gradients are essentially just differences in pressure between two different points cause a force this means that these oscillations then travel they propagate through the air as a sound wave that's all sound is the way we mathematically describe this though is through the equations of fluids known as hydrodynamics it's relatively simple to derive the equations of sound from hydrodynamics in fact it spits out what the speed of sound actually is but treating air and other materials as a fluid is just an approximation for instance if you decrease the density of air to such a rate where it actually matters the air is made out of individual molecules otherwise known as kinetics then the equations of hydrodynamics will break down and it can be argued sound in its fluid sense no longer exists but what about in space space isn't a true vacuum in fact none of the vacuums that you've come across are true vacuums because nature abhors those there's always some matter present and no I'm not talking about vacuum fluctuations where pairs of particles pop out of existence due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle from seemingly nothing now I'm saying that there was never nothing in the first place space is filled with plasma be that from planets ionosphere to solar and stellar winds or even the interstellar medium itself they're all incredibly weak plasmas for instance the seemingly empty space between the planets actually contains five protons for every square centimeter compared to the air around me that is almost nothing but it's not absolutely nothing and it turns out even that almost nothing is enough for sound to exist one of the simplest ways that we can describe plasmas is essentially by merging Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism with hydro dynamics forming something called magneto hydro dynamics this treats plasmas as a single quasi neutral conducting fluid magneto hydrodynamics or MHD supports two sorts of waves the first is literally the same as sound but with an extra magnetic component we call these magneto sonic waves Magneto's sonic waves are also pressure waves just like sound is just that they can exhibit their pressures in two different ways either thermally just like in hydrodynamics or magnetically as well a sound wave in a regular fluid which slowly becomes a plasma will turn into a magneto sonic wave they are actually sound plasmas can also support another type of fluid wave a sister to the magneto sonic waves known as alpha waves you can think of these as like waves on a string where that string is a magnetic field line with plasma all along it the question is though can we actually treat the claz MMus in seemingly empty space as being a fluid is that approximation valid well some places including even Wikipedia will strictly say MHD cannot be applied to space plasmas it seemingly works incredibly well that's not to say it works in absolutely every circumstance for instance usually you're talking about distances that are comparable or a fraction of the size of the earth and at frequencies much less than one Hertz so-called ultra low frequencies great so theoretically sound should exist in space the question is does it we routinely detect sound in space all the time many of our satellites in orbit around the earth or throughout the solar system are equipped with plasma instruments that can directly measure the density velocity and pressure of space plasmas and they do see these oscillations that we're talking about but in some cases that measurement is actually incredibly difficult for instance some plasmas can be too cold to be detected by our instruments that's because satellites charge up in sunlight due to your Einsteins photo electric effect and if the particles themselves don't have enough energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion then there's no way that we can actually detect those particles but there is a handy way around this because plasmas and magnetic fields are tied to one another through something called the frozen in condition which I talked about when I discussed lightsabers we can actually forego measuring the plasma directly and just measure the magnetic field and look for fluctuations in that and as we know electricity is tied to magnetism any fluctuating magnetic fields will have a fluctuating electric field associated with it so that's something else that we can look for and even though it's not sound directly that we're measuring it is still sound but why should we care about sounds in space that are so weak they can't even move our eardrums and at frequencies we'd never be able to hear well it turns out ultra-low frequency magneto sonic & alfv√©n waves contribute to space weather that is phenomenon from space that can affect our biological and technological existence I'm talking about things like GPS mobile phone networks weather forecasts our power stations being affected by things from space and in some extreme cases even our lives if that's not something to scream about I don't
