okay so in the last episode we learned how to create a front page only using HTML and CSS and in this episode we're going to learn to build a couple more pages such as a cases pace and a case page which are going to display all the different cases you might have inside your portfolio and the case page is going to display one of these cases so we can actually see it now on our example here today we're going to be inserting a video inside the case page with some kind of text in it now before we get started on actually coding anything there's a couple of questions I would like to answer that you guys asked me in the previous episode in the comments and if you guys don't want to hear this just go ahead and jump to the time step below and you can go out and skip in and jump straight to the coding part if you want to now the first question I got was why did we not use bootstrap now for the people don't know bootstrap is what we call an HTML framework which we have frameworks in all kind of languages such as PHP JavaScript and so on so on so on and what this one can do is it can make making a web site a lot easier and faster and make it responsive immediately as we start making the web site now the reason we the news bootstrap is because bootstrap is based on HTML and CSS meaning that we should already know HTML CSS when we use bootstrap and because this is a HTML course meaning that we haven't learnt HTML entirely yet I decided that we're not going to use any kind of frameworks if you want to learn a framework I will in the future start focusing on frameworks as well but for now we're just gonna build a website using core HTML and CSS okay now I also got aunt asked why did we not use something called flexbox in the previous episode so as you guys may notice in the previous episode we use something called float in order to position elements next to each other inside the website and we didn't use flexbox and there's nothing wrong with using float it's the way we've been doing it for many many many many years now but flexbox is a new thing that makes a lot easier but because we haven't learned it yet inside the course here we didn't use flexbox in the previous episode ok so let's go ahead and get started with the actual website here so as you guys can see this is what we did in the previous episode we have a header up here we have a banner we have a couple links and we have a footer now what I want to do here which we didn't do in the previous episode is I would like to the header to follow me when I start scrolling down because right now the header disappears and I would like it to always be there so I'm gonna go and go inside my coding document and I'm gonna go down to the head of styling so we're just gonna go below our reset code and go to the header section which is right here and inside my header tag I'm gonna go ahead and add a position which I'm gonna set to fixed meaning that this header is going to be positioned in a fixed way inside the website again if I'm making typos it's because I can't see the keyboard it's it's under the microphone so we're gonna set it to fixed I'm gonna go and position it at the top zero pixels or just zero right it's gonna be set to zero left it's also gonna be set to zero meaning that it's gonna be touching the left to top and the right side of the browser so if I go back inside the website you can see that a couple of things happens first of all all the content below here sort of jumped up behind the header because we put it on a different layer by adding a position element to it we need to fix that in a second and what also happened is that when I start scrolling you can see that they had a stays which is a really nice effect to have inside a website okay now let's go out and fix that all the content jumped up underneath the header so if we go inside our styling again we can go down to where we have the content starting which is below the header here so we have what we have to in expand on that's actually going to go back inside the website inside the HTML file and see that all the content we have inside the main page is actually inside a main tag so I'm just gonna go and grab this main tag go inside my styling again and I'm just gonna go ahead and go above at the top here above the head of styling because we have some default styling at the top here and I'm just like to have it here so I'm going to save ever main tag gonna give it a styling set to push not precision padding - top which is going to be set to the high of the header which right now is 100 pixels like so meaning that all the content on all pages are going to go below the header like so so now it looks normal again and when we scroll it stays up there it's just really nice now we could also have changed the text size in the footer which we didn't do in the previous episode because it is quite big but you guys should know how to do that so I'm just gonna go and keep it like that for now okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to go and go inside our document here or inside the text editor and we're gonna go ahead and create a cases page I'm gonna save the document here as cases dot HTML and I'm just going to save it directly inside my main directory of my root folder so we have the index file and we have the style see it right next to it okay inside of here I'm gonna go inside my index page gonna copy everything so I'm gonna say control a or command a copy and paste it inside the cases page now what is going to happen here is that we basically just copied the entire front page and made it into our cases page as well if you go to cases inside the website we have the same content as the front page now a couple of things I want to note about this is that right now if I were to make a change inside the navigation let's say I want to add another menu point such as about not about me but about us perhaps then I need to change that inside all pages inside my website and you might be asking well can we just changed it in one place and it changes everywhere well yes but it requires other programming languages than HTML so we could use something like PHP in order to do this but since we're not learning PHP in this lesson we're not gonna do it okay so what we're gonna go and do here is I'm gonna go ahead and delete everything we have inside the main tag so I'm just gonna go ahead and delete delete delete all the way down to right before the main tag ends I'm gonna save it and then I'm gonna go and go inside my website refresh and go to cases and we have a couple links we can do that we can go to cases up here in the top right or we can go down to the link we have down here so if I click it you can see that we have a page without any content inside of it except or the header and the footer so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna go and open up my design really quick because I didn't actually open that up before we got started here I think I do have it here there we go and what we're gonna go and do is we're gonna go and built this page and I know there's a mobile version down here below which we're not gonna build like I said it's it's basically just the same thing as in the previous episode if you want to make the website responsive but it's gonna be a much too long episode if we do respond to design on two pages today as well so we're not gonna do that today here okay so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna go and build this page here zoom near the cases header tag that is up here and then we need eight links that goes below here and then a contact me banner and I don't know why this is blue well I do actually know because I was messing around with it after the previous episode there we go so basically just gonna build this section here which should be fairly easy to do so I'm gonna go inside my coding document and inside the main tags I'm gonna go out and create a 82 tag again because it doesn't have a lot of text inside of it I don't think it should be an h1 tag again we don't really have any other sort of text inside the cases page here so it could be an h1 tag for one or two because it's the only important text in here but I usually like to use a paragraph or something on top of the cases that says hey here in here you can check out my cases blah blah blah because it has a lot more information in it which means that it should be a lot better to put inside an h1 tag for example that's just my way of doing things so inside the h2 tag here I'm gonna go and say cases and then below the h2 tag I'm gonna go ahead and create a dip box it's going to say did and we do have a bunch of different html5 tags that we can use in order to tell the browser what kind of content we have inside the website in this case here we're just gonna go and stick with a div so inside the div here I'm gonna go ahead and give it a class I could actually insert all of this inside a section which is probably a good idea so we're going to create a section tag and we're just going to insert everything inside of it like so and the section tag we're also going to go and give a class because we need to name it something so we can actually separate the content inside of here now I don't think we need to include a class down inside the div tag again one of you asked me in the previous episode about good programming habits when it came to building websites and one of them is that we want to reuse code as much as possible so if I had to create eight different div boxes that had different classes then I have to create eight different styling since at the CSS file with you know basically the same code inside of it so what I could do instead is to simply say we have a section which is the container for these div boxes and say we have a div inside this section here okay so we're reusing code so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go and say we have a section that has a class named something like cases - links and inside the tip box here I'm then gonna go ahead and add the information that we want to have inside the box which right now if you take a look at the design I just wrote case one case two case three so and so on and so on we can just go ahead and do the same thing here so I'm gonna gate I'm gonna go and create a paragraph set it to case one again if you have a case about maybe making a video for company then you should probably name it something relevant to what you did for that company or maybe the company name that you made it for okay so now we had this we can go ahead and save it and copy/paste it so we need eight so two three four five six seven eight we're gonna go inside our style sheet and I'm gonna go and go down to the bottom here I'm just gonna scroll Scroll scroll right before we hit the photo styling which is right here now I'm just gonna go ahead and create a comment that says cases because now we're styling the cases page and in here I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a class called cases - links curly brackets and inside of here I'm gonna go ahead and say we want to well first of all we need to say we want to target the divs inside the cases links and inside of here I'm gonna go and say we have a width set to let's actually go and check what I did in here now inside my design here does say 235 pixels for each box but because we also need to calculate the margins in between the boxes this might not be the correct width so what I'm gonna do is first of all I'm gonna go ahead and pull out a calculator and inside the calculator I'm gonna go and take the wrapper with which I'm just gonna check out inside my code here so we're gonna say we have a wrapper which is up here somewhere let's just see if we can find it we may not have a wrapper in here all here this a thousand pixels so I'm gonna say a thousand pixels and then we're gonna figure out what exactly the margin spaces can be in between the boxes we're gonna say we have four boxes there's gonna be a margin of about five pixels on each side so five five for the first box which is ten then five five for the second box which is twenty thirty and forty so we have forty pixels in total that we need to subtract from the width for the box here so we're gonna say minus 40 and then we need to divide that by four because they're four boxes so I say divided by 4 so 240 pixels is going to be the total width of each of these boxes here and I'm just gonna set maybe the same thing for the height maybe a little bit longer we're gonna go ahead and test it out to see what looks good so I'm gonna go back inside my code I'm gonna go down to the cases and I'm gonna set the width to 240 pixels again it's a little bit of math involved in making websites which is always a good thing we're gonna set the height to the same thing just to see how it looks like I'm gonna set a background color - there you go - hashtag ìiî ìiî ìiî because that is a very light gray color and I'm just gonna go ahead and add a float to it immediately again floating is what I talked about in the beginning here we do have other means of positioning a next to each other inside programming but because we haven't talked about those yet we're gonna go and stick with floating which is the the way we used to do it in the past and we still do it this way but it's sort of becoming it's sort of being updated right now so we can use something called flex box you'll see it's this grid there's a lot of things we can use instead of floating but I'm just going to stick with float today so I'm going to say left and I'm just gonna check how the website looks like so I'm just going to go inside the browser and refresh and as you can see if you have a bunch of them next to each other so what we need to do now is as you guys may notice we do have one two three four five six boxes next to each other we only need to have four and then four in the next line and the reason we have all of them at least six of them next to each other is because it had room for six inside the the width of the browser here now when we do actually include a wrapper it's gonna cut the amount of space available meaning that once when it can't fit in another box it's just going to go down to the bottom and start in the next line which is what happened with these two down here so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap our div boxes inside a wrapper inside of cases page I'm just going to move it over and so I'm gonna go after cases the h2 tag I'm gonna say we have a div and I'm gonna call this one wrapper because that's what we have it styled inside the the CSS file then I'm gonna grab all the tip boxes and I'm just gonna go ahead and copy delete and paste it inside the wrapper here and save it if you go back inside the website which is not the design there we go now as you can see we do get AIDS have an error here because the box is not behaving like we want them to and essentially if you're go ahead and take a look at our code here you can see that inside our CSS file we said that if we had any kind of dip boxes inside the cases links then it's gonna go out and add this styling to it meaning that right now our wrapper is also a dip box inside our code here we go back inside the right page you can see that the wrap is also dip box and the tip box with the wrapper is also inside cases links so all of these boxes here are gonna get this styling which is not what we want so I'm gonna go and rename the the cases links div to something else so I'm gonna say cases links to class cases - linked in singular form so we don't have to s behind it and then I'm gonna go to add this class to all the elements inside our cases page we're going to say we have this div here let's grant a class to it just gonna paste in cases linked then I'm gonna go ahead and copy and just paste it and replace all these boxes we create it down here so we're gonna say one two three four five six seven eight so now they all have a class in here and if you go back inside the website refresh you can now see that we get something that looks a bit more like it should now what I'm gonna do here is I would like to go inside my code and add a wrapper or not a rapper but a margin - all these boxes here because we need some spacing in between them so I'm gonna go inside the code again inside the CSS file and right after the height and again the order here doesn't really matter too much so I'm just gonna go and add it under the height because it makes sense to me and I'm gonna go ahead and add a margin and set it to something like five pixels because that's what we calculated inside the calculator and I'm just gonna go and add five pixels to the top five pixels to the left and right and serial pixels from the bottom I'm gonna go and refresh and as you guys can see we now have something looks a lot better inside the design here and again if you wanted to add 20 pixels of margin in between them then we need to calculate 10 on each side and we have to calculate it over again so you could add more to it if you wanted to now I did also notice that the spacing under underneath the boxes is smaller than the one in between and that's because we added a serial pixel from the bottom so the top here has to be 10 pixels because needs to need to have for both the top and the bottom and now you guys can see that all the boxes have the right spacing all around it now the last thing you need to fix here is that the footer is actually touching the links and there's two things we need to fix here first of all because all the inside the container here a floating we're gonna meet the same era as we had in a previous episode and we can actually go and see the arrow here if I were to right-click and inspect what we have inside the website if I were to highlight our cases link links box you can see this is not very tall because it should cover the entire height of these boxes here as well but because all the elements are floating inside the container the container is only gonna have a very small height and we need to fix that so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go inside my code and I'm gonna go and take our cases links not the individual dip box inside the container but the actual container and I'm gonna cut and add a styling to it so I'm gonna go and say first of all wants to say overflow it's gonna set to hidden we're just going to fix the fact that it can't register all these boxes inside of it and I'm gonna go to add a margin to the bottom of it so we can get some spacing from the footer so I'm going to say margin - bottom and set it to something like let's say 30 pixels I'm not sure we did inside the front page so we might have to double check that if i refresh now you guys can see we have what we call it spacing down here which is not gonna work if we don't have the box covering the entire height of these cases here so not only have this we can actually go in just double check what we did at the bottom here we did have I think 20 pixels that might be right yeah so we need to change this to 20 pixels now one thing we might also want to change is the fact that you can see there's ten pixels in between each box here and if you go to the front page you can see that we have much more space we actually have 20 paces of space inside these boxes here so we could recalculate that really quickly if you wanted to so let's actually go and do that so we're gonna say we have a wrapper which is 1000 pixels then we want to say we have 10 on each side of each box which is 20 times 4 so we have 80 so we want to say - 80 pixels divide that by 4 and then we have 230 pixels instead so let's actually go and go inside our code and let's actually go inside the Paige so we can actually see the change when it does actually happen then we're going to go inside our code and I'm gonna go and change the margin to 20 at the top 10 on left and right and see her from the bottom and I'm gonna go and change the width to 230 and the height to 230 then I'm gonna save it refresh the browser and now you guys can see we have something looks a lot more like what we have inside the front page because they need to match up with each other for it to look nice inside the website we can't have certain spacing going on in one page and then it completely changes on the second page because that sort of ruins the proximity of all the the constant on the under website okay so what we need to do now is we basically just need to include a link around these cases so we can actually click them and then we need to adjust the text inside of them and we need to add a contact ban of course so if we were to go inside our code we can say we have cases - links and say if you have an h2 tag inside of here and I'm just gonna go and copy some of the previous text that we have up here let's ecstasy if we have something that is already styled if you take the h3 tag you and just copy all of that we don't need to censor it we do need to uppercase it so that's actually going to copy all of it just gonna paste it in down here and I'm gonna go and change the font family to this one so we're going to keep this one the font size let's keep that a 28 font weight 600 that's fine line height is 100 which is not what we want we might need to change that later color is set to black which is fine text-align:center is not fine and then we want to transform it upper case that's fine now we do also need to insert the cases text inside the wrapper as well because I don't think we did that so if you go back inside the cases page let's go to the top and take the cases it's to tag and move it inside the wrapper here so we can get it aligned with everything everything else inside the website so if we go ahead and refresh you guys can see we now have it like it should be now we could also add a bit of space from the top here because I think is pretty close to the logo up there so probably gonna do that as well and but we're just going to go ahead and style the text inside these boxes here immediately so we're gonna go inside the stylesheet I'm gonna copy what we have here paste it below the cases linked and just gonna go ahead and add that to the file path here just gonna say copy paste change the to paragraph because there's what we have inside of it and I'm just going to go ahead and change the font size to something like 16 pixels instead and I do want to censor this text we say text that align should be centered there we go refresh and now we need to do is we need to well I do think the text should probably be a little bit larger and it should be what you call it in the middle of the boxes here so I'm going to go ahead and go inside the code again and I'm gonna go ahead and say we want to change the font size to 24 now in order to vertical align the text inside the boxes here we're gonna do something a little bit different than what we did previously in the last episode where we wrapped it inside a table because we just have one element that needs to be centered so what I think we could do instead at least in this example here is we can go ahead and say we want to take the text and add a padding top padding - top and set this one - not a pixel amount but instead a percentage amount so we could say something like let's start with 45 percents just to test it this might go horribly wrong we need to change it and that did actually turn out pretty good and the good thing about this if we were to change the box it will automatically adjust the text inside of here okay so this is how we could censor the text let's actually go ahead and add links around all these boxes here so if we go inside our cases page we're just gonna go and do the same thing as you did before by deleting all the other cases except one and we're just gonna go ahead and wrap a link around one of these cases here so I'm just gonna say we have a link I'm going to close the link after the case and I'm just gonna sift out the div box so we have some higher key inside the code here so it looks kind of nice and I'm gonna go and change the link to case and we could say something like case 1 dot HTML because in its - it needs to link to just one of the case pages we might create inside the document here again using other programming languages we could make this a lot easier by just creating one document that updates the content depending on what the link says but since we're only doing pure HTML and CSS we would need to create a single page for each case we have inside the website ok which is not a bad way of doing it but it's just a little bit slower to build it this way ok so now that we did this we can actually go into this coffee paste five six seven eight I do believe and that's going to refresh and double check yeah now we can actually click the boxes in here so if we were to click it you can see we get taken to case one HTML just gonna go ahead and get out of that now what we need to do is we need to actually create one of these cases and again you could insert a background if you wanted to inside the link just created if you want to insert an image just go ahead and do that using CSS we're just gonna go and keep it like this for now we did actually forget to create a contact banner I do think you guys know how to do that by now because it's basically just creating a like a box like we did up here inserting two pieces of text inside of it so you know and I don't want it to toll to be too long so we're just gonna go and skip these for now since these are pretty easy to make by yourself so good exercise so you have some homework to do if you want to so what we're going to do is we're gonna create a new page save it as case one dot HTML again you can sort of hear my voice is going away because I've been recording for a while so I'm just gonna go in the copy what we have inside the cases page and paste it inside case one there we go so what I'm gonna do now is I'm just going to go ahead and delete what we have inside this section tag inside the main tag I'm just going to delete delete delete until we reach the h2 tag I'm not going to delete date to tag because need to use it and what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go ahead and say we have another cases that links but a case - links so I'm just gonna keep like this and we should probably also delete links because it definitely makes sense now inside my design here just so we can take a look at it you can see that we do have the title of the case which could be the the one we have in the center here so this one could be Bella if you wanted to and then it opens up the case which says bail at the top here and then we have a video of the dog that we have in the camper here with us and we also have some text down here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and go inside my class here I'm gonna name it case - vid which stands for video and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and say we have this section h2 tag change to Bella again we could just write it Bella and capitalize letters or we could change to using CSS that's like we're gonna use CSS so since we've been doing that this whole time after the h2 tag I'm gonna go and add a video which is going to be an html5 video so I'm just gonna say video create the tag by clicking tap gonna change the file type to mp4 because that's what I have now I do have a video ready inside my video folder inside my root folder and I know you guys may not have this one you guys can always use another video that you have on your computer as an example or you can download the lessons pass in the description of this video if you want to did just notice that it's an MOV file it's not a mp4 files and just contains that I'm actually gonna write the full file name here and it's inside a video folder we need to remember that it's gonna autoplay I don't want that I post the image we could set a post image I do not know if we have that inside my design here we may have yeah we do have a post image I'm gonna go and use that one as well so I'm going to copy it and I'm just contains the link here so we have inside a image folder /and then the name of the image we want to use as a poster now we also need to add control some people can actually control the video and pause it if they want to so we're gonna say control with an S I do believe and then we're just gonna go ahead and see what happens inside the website here so I'm just gonna go ahead and refresh and as you can see we now have Bella at least the title up here and we have a video here that is not quite working we need to figure out why okay controls of course needs to go outside the double quotes there we go and refresh and now I guys can see we have a video going on inside the website here we can play it if you want to again - is kind of messy that day and we're going to go ahead and send to all of this so we want to send it to text and the video so I'm gonna go inside my code inside - CSS file and I'm gonna go and create another comment below here this wrote that the other way around there we go we're gonna call this one case just in singular because this is going to be all the styling for all the case pages we have inside the website so we don't have to make too many chapters inside the stylesheet and I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a if I remember correctly it was case - vid I'm gonna copy it then I'm gonna go inside my stylesheet and I'm just gonna go ahead and add it down here at the at the bottom here like so so basically what I'm gonna do here is every single case page that is based on a video that has for example video of a dog or something else inside of it is going to have the styling as case vid inside the container so all the cases that we have that has this specific styling inside of it set to case of it it's gonna be start the same way if that makes sense so I'm just going to go ahead and say we have this container here and I want to style the h2 tag first we're gonna say we have an h2 tag up here I'm gonna copy from just h2 tag we have up here like so paste it in I'm going to add a text-align:center like so and I'm going to go out and censor the video as well so we're going to go ahead and say we have case - wit and we have a video tag that we want to censor so we're going to say we want to set a margin to 0 how to save it and refresh the browser now the video wasn't censored yet so we need to go inside our code and add a display and set it to block and there we go so now we need to add a bit of spacing below Billa because I think it needs that so we're going to go inside our code again and say we have the video want to add a padding I'm just going to add a padding to the top and bottom set to something like 30 pixels and the sides are going to be 0 and there we go so we're also going to go ahead and actually let's go ahead and keep the the name up here the same so it's actually consistent with what we have inside our cases page so it's the same size as this text over here again so we have the same consistency all around the website so underneath the the video I'm going to go ahead and add some text so I'm going to create a text box inside our case page underneath the video I'm going to go ahead and call this one a article tag because this is a content with independent content inside of it meaning that we could take the text here take it out from the case page and still use it and read about it which is a basically means that we have an article that has independent content inside of it so we're going to use an article pay a tag in this example here so gonna go and say if you have a class actually we're not gonna go and say we have a class because we don't need that and inside the article tag we're then going to add the text they're gonna go and have inside at the website here now as you can see here would you also have columns inside the text that we have down here and there's a couple of ways we can create this either we can create three predict boxes with separate text inside of it or we can create columns using CSS which we're going to go and do because it's much easier and faster to do but it doesn't give us as much control about what needs to go inside each column that we have inside the website here but we're going to go and do it that way anyways so we're gonna go inside our code we're gonna say we first of all have a 8/3 tag which was just gonna go and copy what we have here rec which stands for record video which could be the name of this case that I have here I'm just gonna go and paste it in then I'm gonna create a div box that it's going to have some text inside of it so I'm just gonna go ahead and say we have let's just go ahead and not give this one a class and let's go ahead and add the text that we want to insert in here so we're gonna say there a paragraph and I'm just gonna go and copy all the text if you have here it's gonna paste the first text in here again if it goes out to the side we can go up inside view toggles off wrap inside this text editor here which is Adam and I'm just gonna go and add the other columns as well so we're gonna get inside the design copy and paste copy and paste there we go so what we're gonna do now is I'm actually going to go ahead and insert a width and a height to this dip box we have inside of here so I'm going to say copy paste out styling and then we're just gonna go ahead and change the path so we have styled the correct thing inside the case page so let's go ahead and start with the h3 tag to have inside the article tag so we're just going to go ahead and go inside our style sheet again and I'm just gonna go ahead and say we have a case vid already call h3 and I'm just gonna copy paste on the styling we have from up here so I'm just gonna copy it paste it in here and remove the text-align:center because we don't need it and what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna go ahead and copy paste and then say we have a dip box instead of an h3 and inside the dip box we have a paragraph inside this paragraph I'm just gonna go and keep a lot of the styling because we need to have it as part of the paragraph styling here and I'm just gonna go ahead and change the font size because we don't need to have 28 pixels instead I'm gonna say 16 pixels and I'm gonna go and add a line height to it as well so it doesn't look like it's cramped closely together the lines of text so I'm gonna set this one to 24 pixels again we could be styling the paragraph text separately somewhere else so we don't have to redo a lot of this code every single time we need to include a paragraph which would be better coding habits but just for the example here today we're just gonna go and do it inside each paragraph here now I'm gonna go and save it go inside my browser refresh just so we can see what we have here and now I gasp can see we have some text going on what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go inside this paragraph again and I'm gonna go to add a column using CSS so I'm gonna say we have something called column - count which is going to say how many columns do we want to have inside this paragraph here I'm gonna go ahead and say we want to have three because that's what I had my design and we're gonna go and add a column gap mean that we want to have some spacing in between each of these columns here I'm gonna set this one to 20 pixels that might be too small let's go ahead and test it out I'm just going to go and refresh and as you guys can see we now have three columns inside the code here now I'm just gonna go ahead and increase the the gap a little bit because I think that would be better so I'm just gonna say 30 pixels instead and there we go now we could also change if the text would go all the way out to the to the right side and touch the border because as you can see some words are a little bit too long to you know fit in here inside this previous line but if we do that then we're gonna get some weird spacing in between the letters so again there's a couple of ways you can design the text inside your website I'm just gonna go ahead and keep it like this for now so what we're going to do is I'm just going to go and add some spacing on top of the tag and the title we had here so I'm just gonna go inside my coat again go to the title say I want to add a padding bottom to 20 pixels refresh the browser and as you can see we now have some spacing going on again the font here in the bottom inside the footer is not it's not small enough because it's bigger than what we have inside the actual content of the website which proportionally looks really weird but like I said we could always just go inside our footer down here and say we want to change the links so we have a font size not set to 24 or something like 16 pixels instead so we're just gonna go ahead and refresh and we do also have a title here we need to change just go and do that as well if I have it in here somewhere ah here it is it's down inside the would you call the responsive design at the very bottom here just gonna save it and there we go it looks a lot better when it's not really big compared to all the other text up inside the main part of the website I do think there could be a bit more spacing in between these lines here again we can always fiddle around with it by changing the line height changing different things inside the website but I think this looks good for now so now we have a case page where we have some text we have a video we have a title to whatever paragraph that describes what exactly this case is about so we have a couple of things going on inside this website here and this is basically all we wanted to do in this episode I decent is a project here which was - which wants to create something that looks close to a website again there are some pages that we haven't created yet which is just going to be blank but you can always create those by yourself and just sort of test that what we did in these two episodes in order to build a full website if you want to now I do want to point one thing up before we end off the episode do notice and when I go inside my cases page and go back to the front page there's a delay in when the image inside the banner actually shows like so now that is caused by the fact that the images are used is really big inside the project folder I probably should take the picture that I have inside the root folder and put inside Photoshop or something rescale it down a little bit so it's not really big because it takes a lot longer for the website to load large files such as a big image so we should probably make this a little bit smaller so it doesn't you know take almost half a second to load up the page to load up the the image they have in here so just a tip for you guys if you want to change that okay so now we have practically what we wanted to build in these episodes hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time hey guys hope you enjoyed this video I just want to say thank you for the support
