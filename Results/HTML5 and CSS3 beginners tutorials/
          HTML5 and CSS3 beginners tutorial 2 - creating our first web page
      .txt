hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number two and in this tutorial we are finally going to start writing our first web page so the first thing we have to do is actually save an HTML file so I'm going to go ahead and click save and I've already got a specific place on my computer where I want to save mine but you guys can save yours wherever you want okay so just to keep everything tidy I've got an html5 tutorials folder and I'm going to say tutorial one in there okay and because this is our first web page let's say that this is our home page and whenever you name your home page or whenever you save your home page you need to save it as index dot HTML okay and if you guys want to make sure that it saves correctly as an HTML file then you can just go ahead on this drop-down list and look for HTML which is over the hypertext markup language okay so that's what HTML stands for is hypertext markup language so let's go ahead and save this now and boom okay we've got our first web or our first HTML file now because hTML is a markup language what that means is that everything is written in these things called tags okay and some people call them elements now a tag looks something like this so you go ahead and you type in the smaller than sign and the greater than sign and then you type in whatever the tags name is so let's say for instance we had a tag that was called tag now this isn't actually a real tag but you know just for the purposes of explaining that's pretty much what a tag looks like and we usually have two of these tags so we usually have an opening tag and then a closing tag and the only difference being that a closing tag has that forward slash before the tag name okay and what these tags would then do is mock up some bit of text in between yeah so let's say I had some text here then these tags would be telling the browser how to show this text on the screen okay so they basically mark up these tags mark up this text that's what they're there for and we also get single tags in HTML so we can also go ahead and they'd look like this like tag but then there'd be a closing slash before the end of the tag so we've got single tags and then we've got double tags which you saw just now okay but those aren't real tags so I'm going to go ahead and delete those and we can get started with writing some real HTML code okay and the first thing we have to do whenever we start writing a web page is start off with something called the doctype tag and what that does is declare what doctype we are using what so basically what version of HTML we are using okay and because we're using html5 then we go ahead and we type in exclamation mark doctype I always put mine as all uppercase but I think it works fine as lowercase as well and then I go ahead and I type in the word HTML okay now with previous versions with previous versions not versions of HTML okay we used to have to type like some really long doctype elements in here but with html5 all we have to do is type doctype HTML and we're done okay so that is our doctype declared and our browser now knows that is looking at a html5 document so now that we've got that on our page the next thing we have to do is actually tell the browser where our HTML starts and ends so the way we do that is by putting in another HTML tag so HTML and as you can see this one turns blue and most of our HTML tags are all going to turn blue from now on okay so that is where our HTML starts and then we also have to put in an ending HTML tag so I'm going to go ahead and end mine off over there okay and this is known to most people as the root element okay because all the other HTML code that we're going to type in goes in between these two tags okay so you're not going to put any HTML outside of these two tags okay and that is why it's called the root element because everything has its root in that a in that tag so the first two tags that we're going to put in this HTML tag actually divided our website or our web page into two different sections okay so the first one is called the head and we have to go ahead and end that off as well and then the next part is called the body and ending body so if I just move my mouse so you guys can see okay now what we've done is we've split this HTML into two different sections so we've got our head and then we've got our body okay and I like to indent my code so as you can see there's a bit of a there's a tab actually a tab space and basically that just makes my code look a lot tidier it'll also work if you have everything pushed up against the side as well it's not going to make your code not work but it does look a lot more tidy to have everything nicely indented like this so I can tell exactly where my head starts and ends and exactly where my body starts and ends okay so now we've divided our webpage into the two different sections but we've done that for a reason because inside the head okay this is where all of our background information for the website is going to go so it's stuff that maybe the user doesn't actually see on the website but it's just there to help the website work it's kind of like the brains behind the website so the one of the things that we can put in our head is called the title and if I can spell it right title and ending title and what this does is like display the little bit of text at the top of the browser in the top of the tab okay so let's go ahead and just put this is my first web page and I guess we can just leave the typos for now okay and the body that is where all of the stuff that the user is going to see has to go okay so basically if I just go ahead and I type in some text or actually let's type in this yeah let's just type I'm in the body so I'm in the body okay and if we save this now and we run this in Firefox what we've done is we've just created our first web page and as you can see I'm in the body is displayed in the part of the website that the user is going to be looking at and then our title is actually up here in the tab for Firefox and it says this is my first assist web page because of all my typos so that's pretty much how all of that works but there's one last thing I want to mention to you guys and that is inside of our head we also have to include another tag which is a major tag and you guys might not understand all of this just yet but it'll probably make sense to you guys later on in the series so just go ahead and type this for now and I'm going to go ahead and type the word char set equals utf-8 okay I'm going to end that off with a slash because this is going to be a single tag now like I said you guys might not understand what all of this does just yet but it's basically there to include any extra characters that aren't on our normal keyboard so most of us are going to be using a normal keyboard where we're going to only have letters like from the normal alphabet but this will include like extra symbols that actually like they're not even on your keyboard so most of us probably won't even use that but you guys just have to have this otherwise this is not going to be a valid HTML document so like I said it doesn't matter make sense but you need to include it on every single page so so that's all I have for you guys in this tutorial and as always don't forget to subscribe
