hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 19 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to work with colors in HTML and CSS okay so before we get started I just want to explain that I do have a div tag in my body and inside that div tag I have a paragraph tag that just is working with colors and if I go over to my CSS file then I've already styled my div elements to have a height of 250 pixels and a width of 250 pixels now the only reason I did that was so that we'd actually have a big block that's going to show color whenever I change background colors of my div okay so now let's actually talk about the colors and you guys have probably noticed that every time I've changed the background color or the color of my text in the previous tutorials I always had to use a preset color like red or blue or green or yellow or something okay but the web is actually so much more colorful than those simple HTML presets so let's say I wanted to change the background color before I'd go ahead and type in background color and use a preset color like blue but now I don't get to choose what shade of blue is going to appear it's just going to be the default blue which is like this really dark link color so if I go ahead and click refresh I've got this really dark blue but like I said the web is so much colorful then so much more colorful than these presets so instead of working with an HTML preset like this there are two other options that we can use and the first option or the first way to change colors is the hexadecimal color value so I'm going to speak to you guys about that or if you don't want to use hexadecimal colors you can use something called an RGB color Val and I'm going to show you guys how to do that as well okay so let's just take a look at hexadecimal colors first and basically what a hexadecimal color is it's basically like six characters but they can either be numbers like numbers 1 to 9 or letters from A to F and if you guys wanted to go ahead and get a hexadecimal color you could go over to Google so you could go ahead and just search for like hexadecimal colors and you could go ahead and there probably be a color chart here so color picker and you could go ahead and just pick one of these colors and you get a color that looks like this but what I would prefer to do is I go over to any image editing program so right now I'm using a program called GIMP but sometimes they use Photoshop as well actually most of the time I use Photoshop but GIMP is free so any of you guys that are watching if you don't have the money for Photoshop go ahead and download and install GIMP and if you ever want to get an HTML color go ahead and click click click not kick on the color palette over there and whenever you move your color around here you can see that under HTML notation we've got this number that's going to change and basically whatever this number is that is the code for the color that you are seeing in the actual current color palette or color block okay so I'm going to go ahead and actually just copy this color 0 0 B a FF and that is going to be this really light color blue that I use in pretty much all of my HTML thumbnails and if I go over to CSS instead of using this preset color blue I can go ahead and use my actual hexadecimal color value but you can't go ahead and actually just paste in your color value whenever working with a hexadecimal color in HTML or in CSS you actually have to put in a hash tag just to tell HTML that whatever comes after this is going to be a hexadecimal color so basically hash tag color and you're sorted so now if I go back to Firefox and click refresh instead of having that like really dark horrible blue I've got this nice easy on the eyes light blue so that's much better and like I said we don't only have to use hexadecimal colors so we could go ahead and use something called an RGB color value and I'm going to show you guys how to do that now so let's go back to notepad plus plus and instead of using a background color of hashtag whatever let's go ahead and take that out and we'll type in the letters R G B which stands for red green and blue and then you're going to open up your parentheses and then you're going to have to put in three different values so the first value is how much red you want in the actual color then how much green do once in the color and then how much blue do you want in the actual color but if you go ahead and leave this at zero zero zero then that means you're actually going to get black so let's go back here and click refresh and as you can see zero zero zero on an RGB chart is black and if you go ahead and change this to 2 5 5 to 5 to 5 then that will be white and you can't have a number higher than to 5 5 to 5 is the highest number you can use on an RGB color value so just in case you guys are wondering and now you can see that it's actually disappeared completely because we made the background white but if you guys want to actually get like a blue or a green color in between all of that you can go ahead and use GIMP or Photoshop or something again and whenever you change colors over here you can see you've got our G B that's your red green and blue color values and that's pretty much where you'd be able to basically get your values that you're going to need so right now to get this let's actually change it to like a green color if we wanted this a really bright green then we'd need a red value of 12 a green value of 255 and a blue value of zero so if I go back to notepad plus plus and I go ahead and say 12 to 5 0 I should get that really bright green so let's go back here and click refresh and as you can see we've got that really right green showing up okay so that's actually all I have for you guys in this video thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like and share the video it's really going to help my channel
