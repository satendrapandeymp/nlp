Zen coding is a popular way that allows us to rapidly create our markup you can use it by installing the plugin if your code editor supports it and usually there will either be a tab trigger or perhaps command underline there's lots of different ways just check the documentation for your editor to see how you trigger it let's take a look though add some quick things you can do with it if I type a element name and press tab it will expand to the full tag name and place the cursor in the middle so if I need to create an h4 rather than doing h4 my heading instead I type h4 tab my heading it's much quicker but we can do even more if I need to apply an ID I can type pound and notice I'm using the CSS syntax my ID and if I press tab and I do not specify an element name it will assume that I am using a div that's the default so let's try this hit tab that expands if I need to override it and I say I want a ul with an ID of my ID again I press tab and now that will expand as a ul so there's a quick teaser let's go ahead and get this installed now I already have it set up on sublime but if you go to the home page and search for ism coding it's stored on code.google.com addit earth that it's available for so right here you can see whether you use text made or espresso on the Mac and there's even notepad plus plus it's so popular that it's going to be available for just about anything coda Dreamweaver now as my editor sublime text is relatively new it may not be listed here but it probably is supported so let's search for it Zen coding sublime text and see what comes up now we can see sure enough there is a forum topic and we can see go here for sublime text to and this will show you exactly how to install it is very simple so I'm not going to go through all of this with you you can let us know if you have any issues with it but it's a fairly simple process to show you how to get that set up so now once that's set up you can then use it and you may need to restart your editor or to take effect now let's take a look at some more advanced things you can do in addition to creating elements you can create sub elements if I type div and then a less than sign a different element that will expand to a parent-child relationship tab and now notice that creates the div and the paragraph within and it automatically knows to put the cursor there so that's really helpful you'll use this often for lists items because you will never add a list item without at first being nested within a UL so think how long this takes to do the UL then indent then do the li then scroll back and then type in this case I type ul Li tab and then begin typing what if we need to add to list items ul Li and I can say times like math times 4 will create 4 click tab and what's nice about this is I can type 1 and tab will continue to take me through each stop point 2 3 4 isn't that really amazing I was really excited the first time I learned about this let's take a look at other options what if I want to apply a value of automatically to it I can type ul Li and within curly braces the value that I want to apply now if I hit tab right here you'll see it's not going to work and that's because it wants the cursor to be at the very end of the string so if I hit tab here that's not going to work I have to go to the very end and then click it and you'll see that takes effect so you can think how quickly you could create a base layout for example let's say I want to create a layout and we'll create a wrapping div with the class of Raph and within it it needs to have a header element because it's going to have our header I'm going to go into the header and now I'm going to have an h1 element and that H one's value will be my website let's keep it like that I'm going to copy this so we can continue on but let's see what we have so far tab and now created that for us let's continue on though if I want to create a sibling of the h1 element and not a child I can use plus that refers to sibling and now I could say create an Avila mat and within the nav element will have a unordered list with a list item and will have 4 list items tab and now the cursor is first on the h1 if I hit it again it's now on the list item I could say home about contact portfolio and you're done and look at all of that markup we created and next to no time at all it's really amazing now generally these list items will be links as well so let's fix that and we'll say wrap we'll do this quickly header nav h1 my website and then we'll have a nav element ul Li and there's going to be four list items and each list item is going to contain an anchor tag so now you can see I can tab through each one and notice it knows to place a tab within the ref and so that could be home comm tab and that will be the value for the anchor home and I can keep tabbing through these and if I need to go back I can hit shift tab but what if we want to apply a default value to the her F maybe in this case it's not linking anywhere so we want to use a hash I can use brackets and I can say whore F equals pounds and now if I tab you'll see that that value has been applied with five seconds worth of work we've created a layouts and if we view that in the browser we have a very minimal website but we are able to do this in roughly five or ten seconds it's really really amazing so what you should take away from this is if you want to create an element type the element name followed by the trigger and your editor and mine it's tab if you want to apply IDs type the element name and then the CSS symbol for class or ID which is pound or period if you want to create nested children you do less than sign followed by the child you can then continue again if you need to and you can also apply values by using curly braces finally make sure when you expand your cursor is always at the end of the string and lastly when you want to create siblings for example content and then you also want to create a div for main and then another div for footer or something like that that will create siblings so have fun with this I was amazed when I first found this because it saves so much time in the next lesson I'm going to teach you about grids and how they can rapidly increase the speed at which we code websites
