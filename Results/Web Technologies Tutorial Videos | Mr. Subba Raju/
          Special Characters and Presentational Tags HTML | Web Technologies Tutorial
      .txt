hi guys welcome to nourish a Technologies this is Subaru in this video session will observe break tag special characters or nothing but entities presentational texts will start from break pack break tag is nothing but breaking lines already made very clearly definition here BR stands for break it is used to break a line and shift the following text to a new line it is a non-paid tag so non-paid tag we are closing not only like that and we are closing right side also as I said in the earlier videos also regarding this or we can say BR this is we are calling as forcefully closer tag empty tag like this different different names are there now practically we can observe this BR tag now break tag just come to nourish I technologies and again I am writing a mid page then if you are going to save that running on the web browser it is displaying in a single line I want this one in two lines just BR tag you can add save it self or close it type now it is coming to next time it is a simple duty performing BR tag breaking lines and by default it pays a displace always a single line if you want to shift it to next line BR is the best one and generally some of you guys having a doubt why here we need to close please refer my video to regarding self closer tag what I explained as per w3c standard non-paid tag if you close the right side payee tag if you are closing left side left side closing is a mandatory right side closing is optional but better validation purpose try to close the right side right and another one I am giving nbsp non-breaking space it is a special character non-breaking space means here one space available here one space available nourish ie technology softer I want to add five spaces already one available another four I want to add two three four five now if I save this file save this and just I am writing like this save that just refresh nothing changes by default it is taking single space right little bit practical observe for example I am NOT giving any space nourish I technologies doesn't have any space now observe and now one space is not available right now I am running on the webpage observe that space not displayed good now I am coming to my source code nourish I technologies one one space I provided yes it is accepting the space now now again I am coming to source code and I said technologies before already one space available two three four five I am saving that right come to web page it is not affecting means the page by default allows a single page and a single space if you are allowing more than that one space you need to add entity or a special character you need to bring multiple lines BR tag we are using and if you want to add more than one space entity nbsp we are using these entities are popularly known as special characters let me explain first what is a special character character entities can be typed as either a numbered entity or a named entity means nbsp is a named entity copy is a name or entity one six nine is the number entity means the name identity we can use number entity we can use both are possible here all character entities begin with an ampersand symbol ends with a semicolon n of this rule based we'll try to work on that go back and I required nbsp first nbsp definition i will try to show you this is in basement stands for non-breaking space it is used to add more than one space between words characters it is a special character or entity syntax I made very clearly here n base starting with Amazon ending with semicolon how to use this one on the webpage yes nourish I after I required five spaces ampersand nbsp semicolon so one means one space it is giving okay right save that and two three four five good five spaces I am going to show nourish i5 spaces technologies so perfectly it is working so if you are going to add between characters for example I available and I between I added this one now technologies is there and I have adding P after for example some spaces 1 2 3 4 5 right functioning or not we can observe so this is nbsp usage like this how many number of characters available more than 100 special characters available of course mathematical non-mathematical special related means more than 500 characters available but right now at least frequently use the characters you want to observe means I made a clear cut the table for easy understanding daily uses special characters and you can observe your copy registration trademark left arrow left side single quotations like that these characters are frequently we are using so these characters I will execute right now on the webpage practically I will show you there are the number of available those many characters are remembering critical that is a reason at least important special characters I will show you now I am coming to source code now nourish technologies I am removing all these spaces whatever I added because already hope you understood that now I am removing simply these nbsp onwards completely so by default I required one space come back to browser refresh narration technologies the title perfectly aligned now I want to mention all copyrights related to nourish I technologies ampersand copy semicolon save and refresh and logo level also we are using registration and we are using trademarks like this any number of special characters we can implement and I am using after this am Prasad I said left arrow ampersand right arrow and refresh if you require next line means you know already that BR tag you can use and like this whatever you want entities for example number entities ampersand hash one six nine copyrights like this different entities available we can implement these entities simply in this manner after this special character next tag is presentational tags related these are popularly known as formatted tags there are the different different formatted tags available first formatted tag I am showing bold strong and other italic emphasis all these attacks we are calling as typography elements if you are going to mobile framework like bootstrap they are calling their typography what is the typography and how we are going to implement separately and show you in the bootstrap framework videos now bold and strong these two packs will try to study be tagged and it is a bold attack it convert the text or characters into bold format it is a paid tag syntax be open be close and Elias is available strong it is also bold tag it convert the text or characters in bold format and strong also a paid tag strong open strong close now I am coming back to my source code I said presentational tax then I am coming to nourish a technology's word is they're already here all special characters I am removing now narrates technologies only one line available no break required just I am adding B and same B is paid to tag and UK and run it oratio technologies so once that is happens on your webpage and I am coming to right here madding same bold I am giving as strong st are o ng and ending with strong save it break tag mandatory otherwise single line will come output save it and run it equal say and Ito output so B for bold strong for a bold next one italics and emphasis we can observe I for italics it is used to display italics font on the web page and same emphasis available these two tags are paid attacks and practically we can and I and again I I said emphasis II M I made II M and E M emphasis now I am coming back to execute on the web browser yes perfectly both are providing same output nourish I technologies in italic format and striking effect three taxable in a striking effect what is striking effect first will try to read the definition we can able to display striking through text striking through text on the web page it is in getting removed content are generally in in some kind of student related applications you can see Paul is related application you can see for example application submitted time completed simply the notification available but they are giving striking means notification already closed or application time already closed so that indication purpose yes we are using strike we are using latest Dell also we are using all these three are paid attacks now I am coming there simple I am showing with you JavaScript JavaScript frameworks I am writing one word JavaScript frameworks once JavaScript frameworks what is there simply as I said yes I said now the same word strike I want to replace remaining emphasis also next one also here break not required and simple I am saying strike st RI k and another one also i need to modify and here is a dell available dell also will modify and here also del available dell will modify save it once we save that just if you are refreshing yes javascript frameworks one strike line occurred here and that is a striking through we are calling of course same property in CSS also available you'll see in cascading style sheet level separately now this is called yes strike and del these are the striking through text display next one underline how to underline the text it is used to display underline text on the web page it is also a paid tag and now underline purpose I am taking right same simple I am using you and you closed remaining two tags I am going to out and I said here simply my mother technologies nourish I technologies I am using and refresh break not compulsory just you underline so this is underlined tag simple uses available right next tag we can try to observe after underline that is super script available subscript available superscript means generally displaying power subscript to be generally displaying base same tags right now in html5 added in the form of a mathematical markup language that mathematical markup language level information separately we can see first I will show you superscript it is used to display subscript it is used to display it indicates power it indicates base now both are paid attacks come back to our source code I am writing here simply superscript and subscript it is the power of it is the power of and I made subscript and I said cube and I am giving ESU P then BRE our tag you can use and after BR tag it is the base of it is the base of hundred sub and better I am giving generally 10 is common comma we are seeing base in the mathematics also now BR tag not required because next line is not there first we'll observe how these two are executing yes power and a base for example can't we apply for the strings yes we can apply that now for example narae's technologies available I am showing nourish i technologies so once the ratio technology is available i want to apply sub sub script now once you are giving for subscript here so and close it and write and try it so this is what exactly and you want to apply the same thing sup and here you can apply and here also you can apply now you can observe I available on this area like this we can apply this is subscript superscript usage after the sub and superscript next one is small tag available big tag available yeah both are paid tags available small as well as big both are it is used to display small font size it is used to display big font size this is also paid this is also paid tag now come to here and I am writing here small s M a ll small tag and I am removing completely the superscript whatever I implemented just now for the before example now I am writing small same Nareesha technologies I want to display in bigger format big first next small we can see visibility correctly available now that is big and big so this is big this is small BR tag for the next length so once you are adding BR tag it shows in the next line output so big small clearly so big and small both are paid attacks next tag we can see that is tt Tilly type of format and it is used to tell you type it is used to display some kind of dot matrix printer characters type it is also paid tag just will go back to source code and I am saying TT and I said TT and normal I don't want to display anything normal characters I am leaving like that so narration say technologies one is a teletype another one is a normal so how the output is coming we can observe this is this is normal text by default times new roman' upper one is a teletype right next one q q is nothing but codes it is used to display double code text now I will try to display narae's technologies within double quote and it is paid attack right come to webpage and execute nowadays high technologies perfectly displayed within the double quote single code also special character audition left side our right side LS left side single quotes now finally we can observe center attack how to display the text in the page center and for example you want to see that and narration technologies I want a page Center C n T R this is Center attack close this next line not required for me so automatically no Brad no break tag required and next line also I am removing whatever the quotation available already we observe that come to browser and say that is a technologies correct pay center available increase or decrease it is increasing and decreasing base center and another tag available that is a block code it is a special tag we can say block code always something special text city is always displaying it is allowing block text block a text in the sense not a text in the block quotation or double quotation it is always a displaying with the left side right side top or bottom with some kind of margin spacing like that it is also a paid attack and how simple it is coming will try to observe nourish I technologies available I am writing be elbow seek a block code and same block code I want to open open here I am closing be elbow seek a block code write a block quote open block code close if you see like this that much clarity not available before I am giving I am applying here my name I am playing for perfect visibility purpose and Here I am writing down another one is simply and for ten years like that I am writing two lines I wrote just to indicate what exactly this now if you refresh that see the how it is maintaining distance left side top bottom completely this is something special it is block type block space it is going to be applied for the web page how we are going to apply practically in the paragraph level I will try to show you there we can observe so these are the presentational tax or formatted tax whatever the list as shown in this video session same like this you can try to practice on the notepad or any kind of ID you can take thank you for watching my videos
