hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 15 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to use colors in CSS so you'll see that I've got my text editor open and this is the same code as the previous tutorial so I just got my paragraph linked to my external style sheet and I've kept the same CSS as the previous tutorial so if I take a look at this in my browser then this is what it looks like I have a paragraph that is I tell it I italicized bolded size 36 pixels or something and Helvetica right so now I want to show you guys how to use colors in CSS because in the previous tutorial well not not the previous one but the one before that I showed you guys that you can use colors to change the color of a text or the color of text right so this is the color property and it changes that color of that text right so by default text is black in my browser but if I want to change it there are a whole bunch of preset HTML colors that I can use so in previous tutorials I've used blue I've used red there are orange pink gray there are a bunch of preset colors but they are really really really limited so you have about 20 colors to choose from if that and let's say you wanted to use blue but you didn't want to use the specific blue that appears whenever you use this color right so let me just save that and if I come back over to the browser and hit refresh you can see that this blue is pretty much a royal blue it's a kind of like a dark blue but I don't really like like this and let's say I wanted to use a different color blue how do I go about doing that well there are two different ways I can do that I can use an RGB color or I can use a hexadecimal color so I know those names might sound confusing but let me show you guys how to get one of those values so the first thing you could do is just Google CSS color picker and this will then present you with a color picker in Google if this doesn't show up scroll down look at the results there's a whole bunch of CSS color picker tools that you could use that are on actual websites so you could use that although this color picker bold straight into Google is a really cool tool and so I'll either use this or most of the time I'll actually use Photoshop so if you don't have Photoshop use Google if you do have Photoshop use Photoshop it's up to you and basically what you do here is just like pick the color you want to use so let's say I wanted to use like a very light kind of baby blue color or a sky blue let's look for a sky blue something like that right so there is my color showing up same thing over here if I wanted to just search the color will show up over here and you can see that we've got this number with a hashtag in front of it that is called a hexadecimal value in Photoshop it appears down here so that is our hexadecimal value and right now neither of them are the same but let's just copy this and I'm going to go over to HTML and paste that color in over here and this color always needs to have a hashtag in front of it the reason why is because the hash tells the browser or tells whatever browser rendering our website that we are using a hexadecimal color and this is the hexadecimal code of the color we want to use so let's save this I'm going to jump back over to the browser hit refresh and you can now see that I've got a very light baby blue kind of color appearing which is exactly what I had here in Photoshop so that is how you can get hold of a hexadecimal color the other color that you can use is an RGB color which you can see in Google's color picker is over here so RGB stands for red green and blue and if you think back to like your first art class that you ever had your teachers probably would have told you that all colors in the world can be made from three different colors and these are our primary colors and these primary colors are red green and blue right so you need to mix these colors around actually I think yellow is a primary color and green isn't so confusing but yeah what you need to do now is just mix all of these colors or look oh wow I feel like I'm in an art class telling you to mix colors No okay so what you need to do now is just pick a color that you want to use in this case I think I might want to use a pink or not a pink but a red so let's look for a nice nice color red over there that I think that looks good and you'll see that these numbers kind of change so let me just copy this and I'm going to paste that in my text editor and then I'll explain so you'll see that these numbers kind of change but they never go above two five five and they'll never go below zero because RGB values have a maximum value of 255 and a minimum value of zero so if you set all of these to 255 you'd have a white color and I can prove that by just pulling the the little color picking dot all the way to the corner over there and you can see that white is 255 255 255 it also has a hexadecimal color of ffff FFF and then black has an RGB value of zero zero zero or an RG a hexadecimal value of zero zero zero zero zero zero zero right and then everything else in between is kind of a mixture of odd numbers so that's exactly how RGB values work right two five five is the highest value zero is the lowest value and the more or less the numbers are determined how much red how much green how much blue is in the color and therefore determines what the color is so let's jump back over to my browser come back here and hit refresh and now you can see instead of that blue color I've got a red color and this we got using an RGB value now a quick little tip I want to give you guys is that we don't only have RGB we have something called RGB a which stands for RGB alpha and alpha if you guys are wondering because I know some of you might be just stands for transparency so one means that our color is fully opaque it's fully it's solid we can see it right so let's hit refresh and you can see nothing actually changed right because I've got that one there but let's say I wanted my text to be slightly transparent I could set this equal to 0.5 and that would make it 50% solid 50% transparent so let's come back here and hit refresh and you can see it sort of seems to be disappearing into the white background now and that is because we've set that transparency value so it is is 50% solid 50% opaque and you can set this to a number of different values it could be point one point two point five point six whatever you want as long as it's a number less than one it'll have transparency and if it is completely zero then it'll be completely transparent and you won't be able to see it at all so let's get bringing it back to 0.5 so we can still see it and that is how you work with colors in HTML and that is all I have for you in this video so hopefully you found it helpful and I'll see you guys next time
