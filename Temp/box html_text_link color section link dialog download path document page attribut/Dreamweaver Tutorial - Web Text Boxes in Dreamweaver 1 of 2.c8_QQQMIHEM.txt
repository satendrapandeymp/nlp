hey everybody its James from Dreamweaver tutorial Dakota UK and that we'll be looking at these web text boxes that I have created on my website I've had quite a few requests to know how to do these including some requests from some other channels as well web design channels so I'm going to release this tutorial under a Creative Commons license and show you all how to do it they're very useful for adding links adding any sort of paragraphs any sort of text into the boxes and they automatically auto expand and they trust me these these text boxes save you a lot of time in your web design okay so if you're watching this in YouTube I'll put a link in the below bar you can come to my website and just below the video you can click on the download tutorial files click OK it's in a zip file so you can just save it to your desktop and then you need to go into Dreamweaver and recreate the site okay now to recreate the site just go to site new site and if you saved it all to your desktop you can just go and click on the folders icon and direct it to where the local root folder is and then direct it to where the local images folder is also and then click OK okay now if you go to file new will select a blank page HTML xhtml 1.0 transitional and press create and go straight into the code we'll split the body tags as usual and we'll start typing our first div attributes will go div class and we'll call it box and the reason we're creating a div with a class is because we're going to want to recreate this time and time again to create and put different links into our website ok so press refresh you will see that the div as a PA little inside design view and you need to go into the CSS styles and select to create a new CSS rule and we want to define it in a new style sheet and then click OK ok so you're going to make sure that you're inside the CSS folder before you save it and I'm going to save mine as boxes dot CSS so just boxes and then press save and it went to CSS stylesheet attributes at the end of it okay now click OK we're going to go into the boxy CSS and hand code it as usual and it will be done from the table screen beside the source code now you'll see the CSS rule we just created for class box because we highlighted box and we created a new CSS rule from that so I'm going to split the tags open there and we're going to add a background image and a few various other selectors so I'm going to type in background : and we're going to make it a transparent URL and we're going to select one of the images that are already in the images folder and the image we're going to select is box bottom so when we've selected that what's going to happen is every time you type in div class box it's automatically going to add that background image to every div that has that attribute called class box we're going to set it to no-repeat because we don't want it to repeat we want it to scroll naturally along the webpage and we're going to position it to the left as far as it will go and to the bottom as far as it will go we're also going to set a margin attachment on the bottom so Margene - bottom : and we're going to set it's ten pixels and we're going to say it's a 10 pixel so it will push away and you can below it by 10 pixels we're also going to set some padding so we'll go padding : and we're going to set it to zero pixels top zero pixels on the right we're going to set it to 15 pixels on the bottom to push up any content within it so it doesn't spread outside of the the image and we'll set a width of 250 pixels which is the width of the image now highly recommend playing about with these settings so you know exactly why I've put this code in and what it does okay so I'm going to save it and preview in the browser so you can see what we've just done and that we've put in the bottom image - bottom image that's going to hold all the content in place at the bottom and remember it's got that 10 pixel margin so it's going to push anything below it away by 10 pixels also okay so remember that every time you go in the source code and you type div class box that background image is going to appear at the bottom now we're going to go inside the div class box and we can add a h3 title attribute and we're going to attach another image to the age free and this will be the top box which will join them all together so I'm going to type in h3 I'm gonna give it a title of box title just a generic title and on the closed at H free off and you can see the text appears in design view and now we're going to click back into the CSS and we're going to add a selector for the h3 so we want to target the h3 which is inside the class dot box so we'll type in dot box and the h3 inside of it okay so open curly brackets we'll close the curly brackets and put in some code now well the first thing we're going to put in is the background image and that's going to be the silver box so we'll type in background : and we'll type transparent URL and we'll search for the box top and there it is it's 250 pixels in width and 35 pixels in height and it's only two kilobytes okay so if I just click inside of design view you'll see it will appear at the bottom there but we still need to make some adjustments because it's not showing to its full extent all right well the first thing we want to do is we're going to set it to repeat if it has to so we'll just type in repeat and we'll also want it to scroll naturally with the page as well and we want to position it 0 on the x-axis and 0 on the y-axis now just position it nice and snug and what we'll do now is we'll change the color of the text I'm gonna type in color : and we're going to type in pound free free free free free free so the dark gray color and colon and we're going to change the font size so I'm going to type in the font - sighs : and we'll change that to 12 pixels and we'll go to semicolon on the end now if you remember earlier I said that the image that we're going to insert is 250 pixels in width and 35 pixels higher well that's not 35 pixels so we're going to set the height on it now sort of the full height of the box appears so it's like being high : and I'm going to put 35 pixels and that's the exact height of the image and we have a semicolon on the end and if I click inside design view or press refresh you'll see that you can see the full image now now we don't quite have the H free title tag where we want it to be so we're going to position that using a sneaky little trick and we're going to type in lion - hi : and I'm going to set the line height to 30 pixels and there you go see it pushes it away from the top and pushes away from the bottom and it sort of arrives there just in the center now pre-built in Streamy but the H free or any title tag will come with a pre-built margin attached to it so I'm going to take the margin out and you'll see that the box collapses there we go so all we have now is literally the image the box and the title with no margins now we're going to set some padding and because I set a line height on the h3 title tag we're going to want zero pixels top and bottom but we will want 15 pixels left and right so we'll push it away from the edge there by 15 pixels and won't allow the title to go any further than 15 pixels okay so let's preview that in the browser I'm going to use Firefox as always and there we go so what you've got is your box the box top the box bottom and you've got the title tag there so now all we need to do is add some content into the center and make a few adjustments there as well okay so let's fill the box and we'll go back into the source code to do that and we'll put in a paragraph tag and if you grab some text from anywhere or if you want to type the text in manually I'm actually going to paste some sexy into the center here and just to fill out the box make it have a bit of content so you can see how to adjust it from there so I'm going to paste the text in now and I'm going to click inside design view to make that show up or press refresh if you want okay we can see at least part of the effects is working because it the box is also expanding in the image is shown below it that's something to do with the padding and Ammar Jeanne's effects in it okay so we're pretty much there we just need to adjust the sides now it is also expanding but we need to add a border to the left and the right and give the illusion that it's completely self contained within the box we also need to add some padding and to the text because it's sticking out very close to the edges there so we need to Pat it in a little bit okay so I'm going to go back into the CSS file that we created earlier and we're going to need a selector for the paragraph so this will be dot box so the class box and the paragraph inside of the class box so open curly brackets close the curly brackets and we'll start typing some code okay the first thing we're going to do is we're going to set a background color so we'll type in background : and we'll say pound F F F F F F if you want you can type in free F and we're going to add some more attributes as well we're going to type in none for the background in E so no background image we'll set it to repeat also
