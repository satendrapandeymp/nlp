my friends myself seanwes today we are discussing about image mapping or this image map or image mapping will see when user want to apply several links for a single image we use image mapping technique like when we want several hyperlink to be included in one image we use mapping technique we use mapping technique that means image should be divided into multiple hyperlinks by using the coordinate system so image map can be used to divide an image into multiple hyperlinks by specifying the coordinates this is called image mapping so I'll show you the demo in the last video we have seen this image how to open how to insert an image right so now when user want to click on this image if when the user wants to click on this image and we should open some link right so like OD ok so now when user clicks on this image we need to open hype early I'm in some website so for that i am using some small concept here i am using anchor tag href right so i need to open amazon website okay I'm just copying this link paste it here now just open it refresh now the image is given some link that means when user is clicking on this image you are opening some page we already discuss this concept hyperlink now within a single image within a single image I need to open two links or you can i'll show the best image again yeah how some image with two phones right so I'll take this I for yep base provides so here just I'm creating one heading and I'm just inserting one image so this image is already given a particular link that means whenever you click on this image you are redirected to Amazon page but the concept of image mapping is that we can create multiple links for a single image that means if you are dividing this into for two parts when you hear there are two mobile 6s and 6s plus if you click on this particular platform I need to open some other web page if you click on this page I need to open second web page that means for a single image I need to give multiple hyperlinks so furthered we are using image coordinate I'm an image mapping with the help of coordinates so here all right now I'm not giving anything the concept is like this just we need to you image so right now there is no image right that there is no link when you click on an image anywhere the link is not open right so for this we need to create your map okay we use map so in the map we need to give some name like name is equal to iPhone iphone map this map is nothing but we are creating coordinate for the image like we use area attack okay we use shape as rectangle I want to create some rectangle shape and coordinates so here I am giving width as like 500 I am giving here same 500 pixel so the image is totally 500 pixels so from two up to 250 pixels I need to create for my black phone one link and for other 250 pixels I need to create link for the 6s plus so now we are need to use this here by using use map use map so what is the map name here created I for map I fall map yes so now what is the coordinate it should start from 0 comma 0 and width I need to give 250 and high days 500 so I'm giving first one then I should hope an Amazon side okay so so I'm explaining once again here we are inserting an image for this image we have given some width and height the images via 500 width and 500 height and we are creating a map that map must be inserted in the image so what is map doing here we are creating some area by using coordinates so now you can just check it the image is containing completely like fire inspect here so the image is totally fine dead pixels width and finder pixels height now what use map is saying a map you are giving here coordinates ok to 1,500 you can just click here the Amazon side is open right so to understand this I am just creating a null reference here now link ya soon okay i am giving other 2nd l difference here ok same ma I'm giving other coordinate ok same shape i need to get but the axis must start from 250 0 and it's to 500 pixel fanta this link should open some other link like eb yes so for a single image we are creating two areas okay two rectangles first rectangle area it opens amazon link and the second rectangle area it opens emailing so just wait say here whenever you could up to here 250 pixels in this particular area when you click on here anywhere it opens Amazon site yes if you open any if you click on this success plus we have given link to ebay site eBay page so you can check it it is opening ebay page so this is called image mapping and you can see something here look you so thanks for watching thank you
