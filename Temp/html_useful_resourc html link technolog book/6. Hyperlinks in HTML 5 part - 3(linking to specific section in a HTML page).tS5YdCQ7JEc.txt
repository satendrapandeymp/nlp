either this is frigging sorry so in slesin we are going to learn how to link two different sections within a web page okay so how to establish hyperlinks are using the with the help of anchor tag to various sections within our web page okay so in the last couple of lessons we have studied how to establish hyperlinks for external web pages and and at different pages within our website in the home page or in the index dot HTML page okay so first let me watch the ready so here we are using a NetBeans 8.0 which takes a couple of seconds okay so first let us create a new closet here so file new project so finally polit HTML st of my application click next and let's name or positive html5 so hyperlinks three only surest of all options keep it by default and click finish here so that means takes the privilege of creating a new page and adding a next or external file within our site root directory set you go to that file here we have a comment let me get rid of that comment here it also that is so get rid of this - tag okay so we are going to learn about you type in a couple of lessons okay in subsequent lessons so first so here we have a blank playing html5 template so let me add some idea to it let's see some water one let's say hyperlinks three okay so let's add some color to our body as we are doing all over the previous essence so let's see a sky blue and also add a h1 tag here okay so it also add h1 tag okay so let's say so it's an attribute so always so that practice to an attribute written our h1 HTML elements we need to use the CSS which we are going to learn subsequently so let's say that our heading is linking to various sections sweater sections within page okay so within a picture so this is our heading and we have our body color VZ is equal sky blue sever on this page in a Chrome browser so that we hit the Run button here okay so it loads the chrome takes again a couple of seconds since my system is very ancient and also you are doing for the very first time here you're running the page or a very first time so here we have a sky blue background and you have a so h1 heading tag okay so here our intention is to link to various sections establish hyperlinks using the anchor tag to area section to jump directly to various sections with another page okay so to do that previously so first let us create some sections here let's add a h2 heading tag and let's name it as section 1 okay so the for the purpose of heading I am using this s2 decade okay so I have taken a heading tag and I have just named it as section so go back to your chrome and reload your page so go back to your chrome and read over your page you have just get this h2 heading here okay so let's add some dummy text here so in order to take grab some dummy text I am going to my browser window so or else you can do it in the column itself I have just opened my opera okay slowing up google if you type it lorem ipsum here okay so this is universally universally used dummy text by the web developers around the world so you're here you have this normal Epsom it is some Greek text if I remember right so if you copy that and paste it in your hair so here you get this lorem ipsum text let me text you okay so if you paste it a couple more four times totally you see your page go back to your Chrome and reload your page so you get that dummy coordinate and here okay so in this way so we are going to build to add some with some sections within our webpage using this dummy text okay inside the paragraph tag okay so let's build another section using this case to take care okay let's say this as section to your table so kay let's take another P type I think there is a problem here we haven't closed that 3ds paragraph tag here so to do that let me just select this cut it and paste over here okay so again let's take another paragraph tag within our section two and let's again paste already we have copied that demodex again it's paste that in that copied that that it takes taken from the internet copy and let's paste it again a couple more times or four times how many times does that that has not made up to you okay so if you want a huge huge content just we are doing it for demonstration purpose again we have if you observe here the section two got loaded here okay so in the same way so let me add all the five different sections here let's say h2 and let me say that section three sorry so here so again let me take another paragraph type it's again a paragraph tag here then here let me copy that a couple for total four times or okay more times or so we take another change to take and let's say here this one has section four okay so again I'm taking this paragraph tag and again copying the dummy content to look it to update our website has some content some dummy quantum theory so I have taken yesterday for section five so section five and again I've taken this paragraph tag and it so again couple more times photo patterns I have pressure of the content if you go back to your Chrome and reload your page so you get your website filled up with huge huge dummy content okay so now our intention is to make here some sort of links so I said if I click on that link that the control automatically jumps directly to that particular section here okay so previously going to that process we need to add a very important attribute known as ID attribute okay so ID attribute just used for this purpose to use in our anchor tag to reference that section okay so here I'm just adding a value attribute to all our sections here okay so for section one I have said that I D is equal to section one here so for section two so saying ID is equal to so section two okay so in the same way I'm adding the ID attribute to all the sections the NID is equal to section three okay so those go back go down a little bit here let's say soy D is equal to section section four here okay so ID is equal to again ID is equal to some section 6 section five again so here we have added all the ID attribute to all the corresponding HTML tags okay so go back to your chrome and I know your page so nothing exciting happens here okay so I really good is a very internal detail to that we use only that ID attribute with reference when we are using establishing links or we are using it in cascading style sheets to apply some styles to that particular HTML element okay so here somehow let us establish that hyperlinks here okay with the help of when you say hyperlink you need to use this a tag okay so any HTF is equal to so let's say now we have to use this home sign let's use that attribute idea interval here ID section 1 an exclusive rate again let's say saline to section one more thing so I have just established in hyperlink so we go back to your Chrome and reload your page okay so here if you observe okay so if you click on that so you observe the behavior how it's happening click on that link automatically takes the control to this section 1 here so we have achieved that using your ID I prefer here so here I need for this section 1 is section 1 here ok so that we have reference here way so let's wrap that in a P tag to make it a little bit distinctly array so I am just wrapping my hyperlink I'm within a cleat a caring so let's do that for all other things ok so again let's take another P day let's make another a anchor type so a HF is equal to hash section so section 2 here ok so let's say the text for our hyperlink a sling but link per section 2 ok so let's close over PA okay so although wrapping up and the hyperlink is not mandatory I am just doing it for a good look of capacity here ok so go back to that page and River your page you have another hyperlink another I cut and I have a write-up tag the click on that directly jumps to this section will take the click on that directly comes to that section okay so in the same way so we can use this kind of kind of anchor tags to all our sections with an order web page so I am just doing it so a href is equal to so hash section section three okay so hash section three and let's close this echo tag and let's say a link of section three okay excuse me I'm just closing my PDA and again I am doing it for each and every section within our webpage and I am taking this a HL f is equal to so hash so section four so let's close this angle tag and let's say so link per Section four E and a so link four sections for me close this p-type heading select we close this PW so again the list so I'm just making taken up P tag and for the last so first for the last section again I'm using the same tables of your section section five okay section five close the echo tag and let's say link for section five wait so let me close this feed and although it's not mandatory to use left the hyperlinks within the pide we have just done that for good purpose so you go back to your chrome and I'll go to your page you have the five different links for all the sections okay so the click on that the control automatically jumps to this section three it will go back it is a click on section four jumps back to section for low back and click on the section pipe takes automatically one since this is end of the page you are not pin pointedly programming that to that section again so there is a slight difference you click on section two automatically it goes to that section again that is highlighted automatically log comes so right away okay so when you click when you click on a section pile that's not the case here okay that's because since this is the end of the page okay so if we observe here this is the very end of the page and it hasn't got anything any content to load okay so if you have a couple of more sections with beyond the section five then you can happily shows up at the top of the page okay so you know that to click the browser back button to go to the top of the page okay so unfortunate unfortunately some of the users who are not unsophisticated or unsophisticated users might not have the knowledge so if he goes here city scroll backs all the way to the top of the homepage he okay so to avoid that problem we can keep another anchor tag at the bottom so let's do that now go back to your chrome let's take another P tag here let's say so a HL is equal to hash talk okay so what is this hash top so we will place that ID I will go to the h1 tag at the top of the page here okay so let's say you need to be very specific here back to top of them so I am hiding it very clear for the text for that one the text of the hyperlink here okay so the h1 so let's have this top attribute here okay so ID is equal to don't wait so I'd is equal to talk to you again so now if you click on that link hyperlink here so if we go back to your chrome and promote your page so you get so they haven't got proportionately so what is the problem here so hey HF is equal to Tom from the page once again so any once again the chromium okay yeah a very silly mistake it's coming here okay so that is not the correct place to be there here they are intended to keep the top and we need to place it at the very bottom here okay so that's the basic structure of a stealing control see it needed to be at the very bottom you okay so if you go back to your Chrome Android or your page so if you have to scroll down so you have so here and hyperlink okay so hyperlink if you click on that it the control jumps right away back to the home here we have achieved this by putting the ID attribute within our h1 heading here okay so here we have a main heading so I have tempted idea it will be to that h1 heading and I have just the reference that I drew attribute within our egg that I here okay so in that way you can establish the link at the very bottom of the page and you can navigate to the top of the page very quickly here okay so in the same way so you can refer to another to a particular section in another web page also okay so to do that first we let create for first me first let me create a new page here so I am saying it is a page right so new periods dot HTML so to do that so I am just getting rid of all the content here I am just copying the entire content just we are using this for demonstration purpose and I have pasted it excuse me first let me change the ID sorry the heading here let me see it has new page okay so the first let me establish a hyperlink for this newly created page within our index for HTML page okay so let's go to top having and let me say that so a so negative 4 else again wrap that in a pre 10 here so a so any self is equal to a new page to our case tml then if this is very small table so to make it a very clear I am using this here first let me close this a tag and using this target is equal to underscore blank okay to make it very clear that we are using a Sony to uphe okay so I have just add some text to a hyperlink so go back to Chrome I read your page so here you have a hyperlink to a new page you click on that so you are automatically redirected to that page in a new tab here okay so what happens so if you want to go to this section 3 in that new page directly so you can do that okay so go back to your ID so let's establish a link in such a way that it automatically the confirm order medical it takes to that particular section in our new page so HTML here ok so to do that let's say that a h2 is equal to new paste or HTML and without any spaces keep the hash pound symbol and let's say I remember the idea of that is section 3 okay so that's the way to do that and let's have some text for our hyperlink let's say section for let's say visit so visit section 3 in new pitch okay so somewhat relevant very specific text ok so to go back to your Chrome and reload your page okay so for a read of your index for HTML page so you have here a hyperlink so to click on that you're automatically redirected to the section 3 of the new page ok so if you observe here so since we are doing that within this same page so to make it very very specific let's take so let's say that target Adam put your heads again let's use the sternal L good for just for understanding purpose it's a target is equal to FM blank so go back to our comb read your page and [Music] and if you click on this and if you click on this you are automatically redirected to that particular section in the new tab here okay so in that way you need to establish hyperlinks or using the anchor tag so to link to go directly to the various sections within your webpage also it can visit up to a particular section in another page also as we have done here okay so this is the basic stuff about the anchor tag to use it to link to different sections within a web page okay so see in the next lesson goodbye
