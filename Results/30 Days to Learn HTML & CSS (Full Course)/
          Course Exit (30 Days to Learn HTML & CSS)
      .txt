congratulations you're finished 30 days later and I really hope you feel now that you have the ability to create websites I know the final project was a lot to take in especially if you're beginning but if you need to go back and watch it all again and you have learned exactly how I would build a website with HTML and CSS now of course the truth is we've only scratched the surface but the great thing is that there are plenty of courses on touch premium that will take you to the next level including one from me called css3 mastery where you're going to learn the latest cool things that you can do with your website so I will see you then
