how's it going gasoline - a first episode not do HTML and CSS now this course here we're going to talk about what HTML CSS is and how you can use it to create complete websites now this first episode we're going to talk about what exactly HTML CSS can do and what you need to have in order to get started when it comes to making websites now HTML stands for hypertext markup language which basically means we can take HTML wrap it around some content inside some kind of coding document and by doing this we then tell the browser what exactly this content is so basically we can tell the browser using HTML that a specific section is the main content of the website another section might be the menu of the website so we can use HTML to mark up specific parts of a website and tell the browser what it is so it's important to understand that hTML is basically a language that describes the structure or the content inside web sites now we talked a bit about what exactly hTML is but what about CSS now CSS is a language that you don't need to learn in order to write a website using HTML but without CSS you can actually style the content inside the website mean that you can actually decide how the concert should look like so let's take an example if I had a menu inside my website the CSS code is actually what decides how the menu should look like you know how big the letters should be what color the text should be or where inside the website it should be positioned so we need to learn CSS if you want to make a website pretty and structure the layout inside the browser now CSS stands for cascading style sheet which again explains that you can style content inside HTML so now that we talked about what exactly HTML CSS is I would like to serve as an example of how HTML actually looks like so inside my text editor here I'm going to go into the second file I have and as you guys can see you have some very basic HTML code now like I explained hTML is basically used to wrap tags around content such as text that you then display inside a website now we're not going to get into what these tags specifically means at least on this episode but just to give you guys a basic idea of what exactly HTML CSS looks like this looks like so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and take a look at a few text editors like the one I have open here that we can use to create websites so if you have any questions regarding how we actually make the website such as the actual process basically we have a folder on our computer which contains all the documents and images and basically all the media they have inside the website it contains all these things and then we later on upload this folder to an online server and it's the documents inside the folder that we need to create using HTML CSS like the one I have in front of me here so now let's talk about the tools you might need to actually create a website now like you guys may guess you need a computer which I have in front of me here and you need to have a basic text editor now the one I'm using is called sublime text which is free so if you want to download it you can go ahead and go to sublime text but come and then inside this website you can go and download sublime text now this version is actually free like I mentioned but if you don't want to get pop-ups from time to time that says please buy the full version then you will need to pay a small amount now the other text editor I'm going to show you guys that you could use which is also free it's called notepad plus plus and you might think well if you haven't heard about no plus plus plus before we do actually have a program on our computer called notepad which is the basic version of this text editor which you can actually use notes to create websites but since notepad is not really good for that since it doesn't have any kind of colors or indicators to whether or not the code is correct I'm going to recommend notepad plus plus which can also be used as a basic text editor now this one will not come up with any kind of pop-ups if you do not buy it so if you don't feel like paying anything in you're tired of popups inside sublime text you can go and use this one instead and of course there's other software out there you could actually use for creating websites but I'm just going to mention these two because these are the more basic ones that doesn't confuse new people now just answer a few questions before we actually get into the next lesson because there are some questions that I get asked quite often when it comes to creating websites which first of all is can you in fact create a website without being connected to the Internet yes you can because can in fact have your website inside the fold on your computer like I said this is how we actually create a website and open up the documents inside your browser without having to be connected to the Internet another question that sometimes get is can I in fact if I code a website inside sublime text open up the same documents inside another editor such as notepad plus plus yes you can because the text editor is not something that creates specific documents of files only used inside these programs so if you were to create this HTML file here and I save it I can open up inside any kind of text editor the next thing I want to mention is some people also ask me about how long it takes to actually learn HTML before they can make a website like I said in the beginning it depends on you if you like to have a long sitting we just learned episode after episode until you can actually upload a website then you could potentially do it in just one day but again I think if you want to do more complicated websites you might need to learn a few more episodes than just you know what you can do in one day now the next question I'm going to answer is recording what it can actually do inside a website using HTML CSS so as you guys can see I have my YouTube page here which is in fact the YouTube website and inside this page we have a bunch of elements on the top here we have a bar that has the YouTube logo that links back to YouTube front page we have a navigation of the side we have a search bar we also have a couple of tools like profile related tools over on the right side we have my profile page with a banner and some logos and some videos down here at the bottom with some different bottoms here now when it comes to HTML CSS the only thing we can create using HTML CSS is the visible part inside the website so we can in fact create everything inside this page here but we can't create all the functionalities inside the page so we could using HTML CSS program this bar up in the top and the look of it and insert all the images and all that stuff we need to have in here we could also create the search bar if you wanted to but without using all the programming languages we can't create functionality meaning that if I were to actually type something up in the search bar and actually search for it it's not gonna be able to work at least not without using other languages so we can create everything in here we can insert images we can insert links so we can actually go back and forth between pages but we can't create stuff like subscribe locked in search bars even the videos down here I actually loaded in from a database which requires another language nor text interact with the database so we can create videos and the text you guys see down here but we have to code it in manually inside the code we can't actually get the data automatically from a database and now max to time our databases which some of you guys might not know what is actually used for inside a website but the main thing I want to get across is that you can program everything you see inside the website but not the functionalities okay so we can make everything but you just need to hard code it meaning that if you need to change something you have to do it using code each time which again is totally doable but it might be easier when you have functionalities that allow for you to change stuff using other languages later on the last thing I want to mention before going to the next episode is that the color scheme inside my sublime text if you decide to get sublime text does not look exactly the same as yours if you just download sublime text and installed it and open it up because I'm actually using a different color scheme inside sublime text so if I write some code inside my editor and it doesn't have the same color as yours don't get freaked out the colors inside your screen doesn't mean there's any kind of errors it is just basically because I have another color scheme okay so this is basically what I want to say for the first episode in the next episode we're going to learn how to actually get started on our first website and how to actually create the folder that I talked about which we call a root folder and how to create our first document inside this root folder which is going to be the front page of our website if you guys interested in more tutorials from me you can go ahead and check
