what is going on guys welcome to your 48 html5 tutorial and in this lesson I want to start talking to you guys about the web storage API so what the web storage API is is basically a new way that we can store data using websites so before if you ever made a website and you wanted to store some data from the user for maybe a shopping car or maybe they were playing a game and you need to store some variables you were kind of limited to sessions and cookies but the web storage API is going to change all that it's going to give you a new awesome way to store data make it much more efficient and give you guys another set of tools that you can use it's pretty awesome so let's go ahead and get started so the first thing I did is I wiped out everything in my CSS and JavaScript file however I'm linked to them both I didn't want to go ahead and rewrite the whole template because that's kind of worthless so what I'm going to do is start from scratch the first thing I'm going to do is build a new section and I'm just going to give it the ID of left ID now I guess I might as well go ahead and explain you guys what thing I'm going to be building actually let me go ahead and name this left box that might be a little better what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be building two boxes on the screen on the left hand side it's just going to have a forum where we can pretty much insert some simple data and on the right hand side or on the right box where we're going to be doing is just testing out displaying that data so I'm not gonna be you know inserting into a database or making it into a game or anything I'm just going to be showing guys how to save it through form and how to display it but once we learn how to save it and also how to access it then you guys can use this for anything you want a game a shopping cart you know Facebook MySpace type website whatever the heck you want so anyways that's what we're going to be doing so I didn't want to just leave you guys in the dark so we got a section in this left box right here is where we're going to be putting our form but for now let me just go ahead and make the right box while I can copy that code and I'm just going to go ahead and name this right box now by default it's not going to display anything so let me just go ahead and write nothing yet Haase right in there because we're going to be changing the inner HTML of this to display what we stored but by default before they even use this application before they even store any data they're going to see nothing yet Hoss because you know might as well test out I don't know what we're doing I just felt like typing something to be honest but they're you so what I'm going to be doing is building a form with three form elements in it text area two text areas actually one's going to store the key the other one's going to store the value and the third one is just going to be a button where you can press it and actually save your information so let me go ahead and make three paragraphs and copy this crap right here all right now the first one like I said is going to be the key now I want to mention this whenever we are storing information that the user enters it's basically like storing a variable you have your variable name in the variable value so you the name could be like age and the value could be 15 the name could be username in the value could be the New Boston so what they do is they call these variables keys and they call the values I don't know if you could guess this one value but let me just go ahead and I'm just going to write one like that and two because I'm gonna show you guys what I'm doing in a second and it's going to make sense so for the first one what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be putting a simple input and this is just going to be a type of and someone is sexton area that's great a type of text in the ID for it is just going to be one and I named it ID one because it's the very first text box and you know I figured it hey why not give it the idea of one so for number two what I'm going to be doing is I'm actually making this a text area and you end those with text area it's not a single tag it's a double tag and I'm going to be giving this the ID of two in that is just because whenever I don't want to give it the idea of key in value because whenever we're working in our JavaScript functions there's actually a method called value or property called value so I don't want to confuse the two so anyways just go ahead and name this first textbox give it an ID of one and give this second textarea you can make a textbox if you want but I'm going to give this an ID of two you can give them names if you want but names aren't really going to matter for this tutorial so the last thing we want to build is a button so input type equals button and for the ID just give it the ID of button and give it a value of safe now the value is what text you want to appear on the button so I just want my button to say safe just like that so as you notice and I probably should have done this I don't know I do it this way but I always build what's inside the form before I actually build the form itself so that might have confused the guy so let me just go ahead and build that form form and go ahead and copy this Rutley and paste it right there and ending form so as you can see we have two boxes on the screen right now a left box which pretty much has a form with three elements in it the first one is just pretty much an area to enter text the second one is the area to enter text and the third one is a button to save it basically we're going to be making a variable with the name of this giving it a value of this and whenever we have everything set we can save that variable by clicking this button right here so let me go ahead and save this and run and launch in Chrome and show you guys what we got we pretty much got a variable name which can be like person a value which can be Bucky and whenever we save it it's going to display in our other box but as you notice a couple things first of all this is probably the ugliest looking website I've ever made in my entire life so what we need to do in the next tutorial is style this you know we don't need to make it look great but make it look at least a little better than this piece of crap and also add some functionality to this baby so you know I don't have to sit here click and save all day and nothing happens so that's what we're going to be doing in the upcoming tutorials and yeah I can tell that you guys are excited already so anyways there you have it thank you guys for watching and we're just subscribed and I'll see you guys in the next lesson
