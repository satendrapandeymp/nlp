hey YouTube how's it going is Clinton here and welcome to tutorial number 27 and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at how to make rounded corners in HTML so right now if you look at my browser you can see : on my browser for my text editor you can see that I cleared out everything in the body so we just got our normal templates over here CSS of all obviously cleared everything out of there and if i refresh this in the browser this is what it looks like I know there was some text and just because I failed the tutorial huh failed recording a tutorial a few minutes ago right so now that we have taken a look at all of this I also just want to look at my files so obviously I've got my CSS I've got my index we've been working with this for some time but I've added in two images that we're going to work with in this tutorial as well so one of them is a rectangular image and the other one is a square image and those are the two images I want to use during this tutorial so let's go ahead and add in an image to our website and we'll use the rectangular image first there are slight size differences in these images but yeah no worries okay so source is equal to landscape mountains of paying the great thing about that is because my index file in my image are in the same directory I don't have to worry about any funny stuff before that okay alt it just needs to be set to something so we can just say me in the mountains because that is that is a picture of me standing on a mountain right come back yeah hit refresh and now we can see we've got this rectangular image in our browser if i zoom in a little bit you can see that the corners are all completely square as if this was a normal photograph that you took with the camera which it is and so what I want to do is round these corners and make them a little bit more nicer if that's a word right so let's create a class called rounded corners and then I'm going to to select the property here called border radius and border radius we'll round all of the corners across the thing that we're trying to round right so in this case it's going to round the top left the top right the bottom right the bottom left there are other properties that we can use so there's border top left if I take that away border top left rias is for the top right radius which will obviously earn you around one corner at a time so if you want to maybe just round this corner and this corner something then you can play around with those properties but let's just work with border radius which going around all of them for now let's set that equal to 20 pixels all right save this come back here hit refresh who made the same mistake as I did earlier I didn't apply a cloth to my image so let's go ahead and add cloth is equal to and then grab this class name copy that paste it onto the image all right so now our image has a class of rounded corners which we know is going to use the border radius property to actually around these corners let's come back here hit refresh and now we've got corners that are rounded by 20 pixels and all of them are round it right we could also play around with this like I said you don't have to round all the corners you can do border top left and that'll do just the top left corner so now this corner is rounded but all the others are square we can do if we just copy that border bottom right so you can select all the corners one by one if you wanted to or just one of the corners at a time so it saves us come back over to the browser come on I don't think it's safe because my keyboard disconnected border bottom right radius is that actually a property just check 20 pixels sorry my keyboard disconnected a seconds ago it appeared on the other screen not on the screen that you're looking at so there we go okay so now we've got this corner around this corner around it and these two still square so that's kind of the effect you were going for you could do that but I'm just going to just go back a few steps here and just have that setting set to 20 pixels right something else you could do is instead of just rounding one of the corners at a time you could run instead of rounding just the corners you could actually turn a square image into a circle or in this case we've got a rectangular image so we can turn this into an oval so let's create a class called circle image and I'm going to set a border well border radius of 50% so what that does is automatically detects how big the images and just round all of the corners by 50% so if we take this cloth copy that and paste it over this other one so we get rid of the other class and we use the circle image class we now can hit refresh and instead of having a rectangle with rounded corners we now have an oval image so if that's kind of the effect you were going for than that kind of how you do that right I understand that an oval is a little bit of a weird shape not too many people use an oval on their site but something that we do see quite often is circle images especially on YouTube profiles when I log into YouTube and I look in the top corner up here somewhere is a circle image of me and circles are quite popular on the web right now so if you want to use or if you want to have a complete and accurate circle then let's just duplicate this and instead of using a rectangular image you need to make sure that you're using a square image from case the images named square mountain so pretty much the same name except landscape changes to square all right come back here hit refresh and now I've got my square image you can see there's a little bit of a size difference between the two images it's just because this one 225 in height whereas this one 400 pixels in height so this one is actually bigger that's why it's it's bigger right so now we've got an actual complete and accurate circle image so that's just if you wanted to use a circle then that's the styling you get right you use you create a class and just use border radius 50% and then you get a circle and this doesn't only have to be applied to images so if I maybe just comment this code out come on okay if I comment this code out I can also apply some of these classes to things like divs and it's not only did I can apply these things to buttons I can apply these things to form elements which okay we haven't learned about form elements and buttons yet but we will learn about those in future and you can actually use this property on those things as well so let's just create a div over here I'm going to say some text in here okay and let's give it a cloth man my keyboard just totally disconnected ah and again I think the batteries must be going flat okay so this gives us a class of what is it rounded corners on the dash corners and I want to give it a secondary class now this is something I probably haven't explained to you guys in the past I might have touched on it briefly right but I think I definitely said when you give a class a name you can never use spaces in a class name and that's because whenever you use a space in a cloth it becomes a secondary class so in other words here I have one class but I can add a second class in you class which I'm just going to call block save this now and if I come back over to the browser and hit refresh about this div with some text but we can't exactly see the rounded corners at the moment so right now this class should be getting applied but I can't see that until I actually add a little bit more extra styling onto this div so let's let's grab that block class come on block and I just want to give this a background color of blue and then I want to give it just a heist maybe of 400 pixels and a width of 400 pixels all right save this now come back over the browser hit refresh okay and there we go now we can see that we've got rounded corners on our div and I div is 400 by 400 we've got the rounded corners there and the text is being affected somewhat because it's like going out of the top corner over there I don't know if I'm I should zoom in to make it a little bit more clear but yeah the text is kind of like popping out of that box so something we might want to do to fix that is add a little bit of padding in here as well so it's got padding and we'll just add it all around the block of 20 pixels come back here hit refresh and now the text is actually within the block it does it doesn't pop out of that that rounded corner over there all right so that's just how you fix a problem like that if you ever have one and it doesn't have to be just with background colors as well so I mean we get rid of this background color and have a border or one or let's go three pixels solid red save refresh and now we've got rounded borders instead of a rounded background color our text is still in there because of the padding right so yeah if you guys ever wanted to create divs or buttons or images to have rounded corners that's how you do it and that is all I have for you in video I just want to send a shout to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that while you're
