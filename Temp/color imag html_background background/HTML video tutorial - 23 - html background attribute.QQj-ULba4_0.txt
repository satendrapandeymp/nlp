hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series let me double click on the first page dot HTML let me right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad in the previous tutorial we understood how we can set the background color to a web page also we understood how we can set the default text color for the web page in this tutorial I am going to discuss how we can apply a background image to our web page to set the background image of course we need an image here we have two images one image with the named pattern dot jpg another image name is picture dot jpg to apply the background image we are going to use an attribute called as a background the background is an attribute with respect to the body tag so after the body text before the greater than sign I am going to write BAC k gr whoa U and D background equal to in double quotations we have to give the value now the value we have to give is the image name Here I am going to Ray give p IC ture picture dot jpg file save go to browser refresh you can see that my picture got displayed over here in the background and you can see that the picture or image is getting repeated in x axis as well as getting repeated in y axis the picture is arranged in a tiled base fashion now sometimes you might be not interested to repeat the background image then we need to take a help of cascading style rules we need to write the style rules then we can control how we can display the background image according to our requirement I am going to discuss about the style sheet style rules when we learn CSS just for the example here I am going to write a simple style row after the double quotation before the greater-than sign I am going to use sty le style attribute to that I am going to give a value value I am going to give is bi c kg ryu and a background - repeat repe ad repeat then the value to the background repeat I am going to give is no - repe 8e repeat semicolon if I say like that file save then what happens is background repetition will not happen we are telling here no repeat okay let's see here if i refresh you can see that the image got displayed in the background only one image is displayed image is not getting repeated so you can write the code in such a way that you can control the background image how it should get displayed I can say here instead of no-repeat I can say here re pe-8 a repeat X repeat - X file save go to browser refresh you can see that image is getting repeated in the x-axis only not in the y-axis similarly if I say just repeat Y file save go to browser refresh you can see that the text is getting repeated in y-axis also if you say no repeat then the repetition will not happen the image will get display only one image will get display if you do not apply any style rule by default file save go to browser refresh by default the image is going to repeat if it is a very big image if it fills properly this whole background then of course the repetition will not happen only one image will get displayed if I want to apply some other image you can see I have one more image here called as pattern in this place instead of picture dot jpg I am going to use PA TT ER pattern dot jpg file save go to browser and refresh check this out you can see that the pattern that I have is a very small pattern it is 1 by 100 by 100 image the dimension you can there and that image is repeated throughout the webpage can you see that so repeat is very very useful most of the time vu we use just the image name when we have a pattern and that pattern will be applied to the whole background this is how you can use the background you can apply the background image to the webpage if you do not want to repeat something then you have to use the style CSS you have to use here you can see I have just used the image name if your web page and the image both are in the same place both are in the same level then you need not to mention the path name if we image is in some other folder then you must and should mention the path name then you should mention the image name for example I create one folder here right click new folder underscore images I put it here I put this pattern image inside the images folder now you can see that the pattern image is actually in the images folder it is not in the same level if I say file save and refresh you are not going to find the background image applied because pattern dot jpg is not in the same level if I say refresh you can see that there is no background image applied if I have to apply that background image which is in the images folder then here I have tried underscore images that is the folder name forward slash then I have to give the image name file save go to browser refresh check this out now the pattern image is applied to the background so hope you guys are understanding what I am explaining here if the folder and the HTML page are in the same level then you just need to use the folder name forward slash then you need to write the image name that's it this is how you apply background image so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share thank you guys thank you much see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
