okay we're continuing along with the fixed layout and we talked about the container in the last video and how we set that at nine hundred and sixty eight pixels in terms of the width now with a fixed layout you have to be rather precise in terms of the widths that you set for your different sections they have to all add up to equal 968 pixels if you're too short or you're too long you'll get some strange results and I'll show you that in a few minutes so it's pretty easy for the header if we take a look at the header here it's 964 pixels right in here and then we have four pixels total of the left and right border and that gets us nine hundred and sixty-eight pixels so it equals the width of the container which it should do but it gets a little trickier when you have sections that are side by side so the main section right here and the sidebar right here all have to add up to 960 pixels so let's take a look at that so if we go down to the sidebar here we've got 176 pixels here and so let's put that in a calculator and again 176 pixels now the border is 2 pixels now you'll notice I didn't put a border right I only put a border left and that is I wanted the borders all around the webpage to be 2 pixels well if we added two pixels here we would get 4 pixels because keep in mind the main section also has a border so I only wanted to put a border on the bottom top and left side and then just use the border from the main section and so we just add two pixels for this border on the left so that gets us 178 now let's go down to the main section and there you can see the border left that I have for two pixels and the border right also has two pixels so two pixels for the border left and two pixels for the border right gives us four more pixels so let's add that in here and now we've got 182 and then the width of this section is 786 pixels so let's add that in and that gets us 968 pixels so everything is very precise and fits our container perfectly and now let's go ahead and alter the width of this and let's make it 790 and you'll see what happens here so let's make that 790 pixels will save this get rid of the calculator if we hit refresh ah you can see it would happen here the main section was thrown down here below the sidebar and that's because this could no longer fit in the container both of these sections side by side now so that's what happens if you're not precise in your calculations in terms of determining the width of your sections in a fixed layout so let's go ahead and fix that and we'll set this back to 786 will save this will refresh and everything's back to normal now if we go under let's put this at 776 pixels and we'll save this we'll hit refresh and now you can see the main section moves it in so this is not very pleasing to the eye is it so that's what happens if your wisk come in under the width of the container so you'll get strange results but not quite as strange is actually going over but it still looks a little weird so again the main point is you just want to be precise so if we set this back to 786 pixels we save this and everything is back to normal okay that's going to do it for this video in the next video we're going to add a few styles here they're going to be like squares because we're going to get to the master and content page concept and so before we do that I actually want to add some tiles to this section and that will tie in nicely to the master and content page concept I'm going to talk about in a few videos so we'll do that in the next video see you guys on
