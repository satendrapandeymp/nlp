hi in this exercise you can learn to start restricting one or more text fields in your forms to allow only characters that you desire to be typed into them we will remove undesirable characters in real time as the user types now let's say you have a web page and on that web page you have a couple of form fields that you want to restrict and in this case we're going to be gathering first name and last name of user so I want to restrict my form fields to intake only letters because nobody's first name should have a number in it nobody's last name should have a number in it and they shouldn't have spaces in their first and last name either as well as any strange characters like dollar sign or question mark so those things should all be stripped away as the users typing okay the first thing I'll do is I'm going to target the event I want and I'm going to happen to just use the on key up event now you can use the on key down event on key press event you can use the blur event or any event that you would like we'll make that equal to a JavaScript function that we'll write in just a moment and we'll name it letters only open closed parentheses and inside the parentheses we're going to put the this keyword and when you put this keyword in a form field like that or in an element that's going to tell this letters only function that we're referring to this form field this input and it doesn't even really have to have an ID so let's just copy that and we're going to put that into the next form field that we also want to make sure has letters only so now all you have to do is make sure that in your document you have the JavaScript function so just as a quick example I'm going to throw in a script tag here and that's where I'll put my JavaScript function but you can externalize this function and add it to some greater library that you're building for your website or whatever or you can just put it directly in the document within a script tag like I have so we'll type in function letters only will open closed parentheses opening curly brace and closing curly brace now we're going to access the this object which is going to represent each field that the user is typing in to dynamically so we can just call it input so the variable name will be input so when the user is typing into the first name field input will refer to the first name field when the user is typing into the last name field this input variable will refer to the last name field so that way you can use this function for more than one form field now the first thing we want to do inside of that function is establish a variable for the regular expression that we want to write and since this tutorial is going to be dealing with regular expressions I'm going to lead you to a page that will show you all the basics and the little nuts and bolts involved with regular expression programming in JavaScript so I'll lead you through that document at the very end of this tutorial which won't take very long so we'll put in double forward slashes and then we're going to type in G for global and then I for non case sensitive now in between our forward slashes is where we put our regular expression logic so since I want these form fields so only have letters typed into them we can group A through Z make sure everything except I'm going to use the caret symbol to say everything except a through Z will be stripped and since we have an I here that means even uppercase a through Z will be allowed and it will be global our replace method that we're going to put on this next line will be a global replace so now we just take the input variable let me say input dot value is equal to input dot value replace method we're going to use the string replace method in JavaScript and the first parameter we're going to feed it is our regular expression the next parameter is what we want to replace anything that gets stripped out with and in this case we want to replace it with nothing we just want to strip those things out so if you're not familiar with regular expression programming don't worry I'm going to send you to a document that will give you the basics if you need a little refresher and so that it the program is done so now you can test this in your favorite browser now as I type in my first name I type in Adam and then I try to put a space it won't let me put a space character in and if I try to type in numbers it won't let me put in numbers it won't let me put in strange characters either only letters uppercase and lowercase letters so if I put a eight it's going to get stripped right out by putting characters strange characters they'll be stripped out if I put in spaces get stripped out but I can put my last name now as an extra layer of restriction what you can do is also make sure you strip out all strange characters and numbers in your server-side language which might be PHP so that means when all this data gets sent from the form to your PHP processing script you might want to also restrict or replace all of the strange characters and numbers that might be in the values because sometimes sneaky people can bypass your forms and submit straight to your parsing scripts so that would be just another extra layer to make sure that things are really restricted now I'm going to show you the document that I was talking about if you go to develop PHP comm and you go to the JavaScript nuts-and-bolts you'll see we have the regular expressions object and here's where you can learn about writing regular expressions in JavaScript and all the little nuts and bolts that go along with it and what all of the syntax means that you see in regular expressions which means you can just change things up so if I wanted to only allow numbers I would put 0 through 9 here and I wouldn't need the eye which deals with leather casing so now if I run this you'll see that it only allows me to put in numbers so if I try to type in Adam it's not going to work but if I type in a number it works just fine so you see how that works you can change things up customize it to restrict it exactly the way you need it restricted by using regular expressions and the string replace method okay so I hope this tutorial helps you start restricting your form fields so people can't play around and put goofy things in them
