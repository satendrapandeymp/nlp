in this video we're going to add a heading to our header I guess that's the best way to put it and this will serve as the logo for our webpage so let's go ahead and take care of that so let's go ahead and add a heading and I'll just copy and paste in here we're going to use h3 we've already used up h2 and h1 in the previous tutorials it doesn't matter you can arrange these in any way you want some people want to make this h1 but I don't really care either way but we're going to use h3 as I said because we've already used h2 and h1 so we'll save this and we'll open up our web page and as you can see now we need to style this because this is stuck up here in the top left so we'll go all the way to the bottom here where our heading section is and I'll copy and paste in here and now we've got our h3 rule set and I'll copy and paste our first set of roles in here and so we're going to increase the font size by 250 percent because this is going to be our logo sized text so we want this to really stand out we want to Center this text we want this to be right in the center of our header and we're going to use this for the color of the text it's kind of a nice off-white and I like to use century gothic for the font so let's save this and let's open up our web page and there you can see we've got our nice logo now but it's stuck at the top and we'll deal with that in a minute now you will notice that 10 pixels of margin were added and this is a little strange but what happened well here was that this h3 element actually inherited from the header up here this 10 pixels on the top apparently so what we need to do is set the margin to 0 pixels down here and that will ensure that our h3 element now adds no extra pixels to the margin you can see it's back to normal so we have this horizontally centered now what we need to do is Center this vertically and that is a little bit complex and so let's go ahead and do that and we'll make an extra space down here to copy and paste the new rules in and there they are and these are the CSS rules that are going to vertically align our text as well so let's save this and let's open this up now and there you can see we've got this nice logo now and it's vertically aligned now one thing I want to point out is that a lot of websites these days are using lowercase for the text in their logo so that's kind of what's going on today so that's why I kept this all in lowercase now some people will capitalize this I'll leave it up to you but I like to keep everything lowercase because that's kind of the trend today so let's close this out now in terms of these rules right here this is for a more advanced tutorial to explain how this works you don't need to really understand this right now all you need to know is that these five rules will always vertically align your text so you could actually reuse these without really having to know how they work but again relative positioning is quite complex and I will do a future tutorial on how this works along with this transform property but again you could reuse these these exact five rules to vertically align any text you want so let's go ahead and save everything up and that is it for this tutorial I will see you guys in the next tutorial when we will deal with the footer see you guys in
