today we're going to learn how to insert a Google API map inside our website meaning we're going to take the map from Google you know the Google Maps and insert it inside our own website so when we do that it's going to look something like this where we get a map you can change you know the size of the map - just from width to width and we can go ahead and drag the map around if we can zoom in we can zoom out we can change the look of the map we can change it back to to just map and we should be able to do this inside our own website using Google's API map so what we're going to do here to start with is I'm going to go ahead and start up a new document so you guys should have a new document as well with a very basic html5 styling like the one we have here now one thing to point out in order to get Google's API map working you need to code html5 code meaning that we need to have this tag up here in the beginning in order to get this working okay now the second thing we need to do is we need to make sure we have a Google's API guideline open inside the browser and I'm going to go and leave a link in the description so you guys can actually find it but the reason I want you guys to open this up is because there's a lot of good references in here in case you guys need to learn something else about Google's API map so what we're going to do here is we're going to go ahead and go through the guideline not you know directly from the website because that would be kind of boring but I'm going to show you guys quickly how to set up the Google API map so what we're going to do is I'm going to go ahead and go back inside my coding program and I'm going to go ahead and start up some styling now one thing that's important to know about Google Maps when you want to insert inside our website is that we have to use a div that has an ID as a map so inside my body tag I'm going to go and create a div like so I'm going to go and give this div an ID as map like so and once we've done that we can actually go ahead and style the dip now the first thing we need to do is decide how long and how tall should this map be so I'm going to go ahead and just either directly inside my my front page document I'm not going to insert it into a external stylesheet you guys can do that if you want to I'm just gonna go ahead and start up here my header now inside the style tags I'm going to go and say we have an ID called map bottom up the brackets or at least the curly brackets and then inside of him I'm going to go ahead and say it should have a height of maybe 500 pixels then I'm going to go and give it a width as 100% now you guys can give it a fixed amount if you guys want to I'm just going to go ahead and make it go from left to right side of the browser so I'm going to say a hundred percent now one thing we need to do as well is since we don't have any kind of reset stylesheet anything going on here we need to eliminate all padding's or margins inside the browser at least the default once we have since we haven't removed them yet so I'm going to say star which means that we're styling everything inside the web site curly brackets margin should be 0 and then padding should be zero as well so once we have the styling done we can actually go ahead and go back down to the div we can actually go ahead and close it here because we don't actually need to put anything inside the div and what we can do here is we need to go ahead and open up a bit of JavaScript code because this API map that we're inserting needs to have some JavaScript code in order to work now I know we haven't talked about JavaScript yet but I'm just going to go and make this really simple so it's not something that's you know the flies overhead and you just don't understand it I'm going to go and take this step by step and just explain what we're going to code here so I'm going to go and open up a script tag which is something we do each time we need to insert JavaScript inside our website so the Apps Script code has to go inside a pair of script tags so I'm going to go and go inside my script tags and in here we're going to create a function now on ovm talked about function shed but basically this is something that we can activate once something happens inside the web so now in this case it's just going to happen straight away so we're just going to go ahead and write function we're going to write space and then we need to call this function something we're going to call it in its map with a big M which means that we initially is the map parentheses curly brackets then inside this function is where we start writing in how the map should function for example you know where the location is when we want to put the marker that we usually have inside Google Maps because we need to tell them where we are inside the map otherwise it wouldn't really make sense to have a map inside our website so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and create a variable by writing BA again we haven't talked about variables because this is not a Java Script series if you guys are interested in learning this sort of thing you guys can check out my JavaScript series on how to you know write JavaScript so we have a variable which means that we have a piece of data we need to set equal to something I'm going to go ahead and call this one location because why not we can call whatever we want I'm going to set it equal to a latitude and longitude inside you know just the typical latitude and longitude coordinates that we can find inside the web so I'm going to say curly brackets then inside the curly brackets I'm going to start with the latitude so I'm going to write lat : minus 25 punctuation 3 6 3 and again this is something you can find online I'm going to show you guys a link so you can find your specific location I'm going to say comment I'm going to say LNG which stands for longitude then we're going to write : 131 punctuation 0 4 4 so now we have these numbers here and again like I said we can find this online now after we have the curly brackets we need to make sure we have a semicolon to end off this line of code and just to show you guys what I'm talking about here if I were to go inside my browser here and find this website here then I'm going to leave a link for you guys in the description as you guys can see if I want to find for example one done like so click find you guys can see we get a longitude and a latitude and this is the numbers that I use inside the code in order to find out where I am inside you know the world so now what we need to do is we need to go inside our code again and after we decide the location which we have right here inside you know a variable we can go ahead and write that we want to start up a new Google map and we need to insert it inside this div we have up here so I'm going to go inside my code again inside the script tags inside the function going to create another variable I'm going to call this one map I'm going to go and set it equal to new space Google dot dot map with a Big M because we need to refer to something called the method which means that we need to add parentheses afterwards then inside the parentheses we're going to go ahead and say we have a document which is the one we have open right here dot get element by ID parentheses which means we're going to go ahead and get some kind of element inside our website using the ID of whatever the element is in this case is called map which we have right here I'm going to go and copy what we have here I'm going to insert it inside the parentheses to create it just here now before the final parentheses you created T I'm going to go ahead and say comma I'm going to say curly brackets I'm just going to move this down next line to make this easier and inside of here we're going to go ahead and say we have something called zoom which is going to be how much you want to zoom in on the map when the web page is loaded when the user enters your website so I'm going to go and set this one to for example 4 which is also taken from the example inside the Google map guideline I'm going to say comma because you need to add a second piece of data in here so underneath I'm going to go ahead and say Center colon space and then we need to write the name of the variable we created up here called location because we want to Center the map on this location here once the map has been loaded inside the website so once we have this we need to go down to the final parentheses down here and write semicolon to make sure we end off this line of code here so once we have this we basically have a map and we can actually go ahead and load up the map inside the browser once we insert a key inside this because inside Google we want to use the Google Maps we need to have permission to use the map so we need to go inside Google's website you know the the guide line in here and as you guys can see it says get a key inside the menu bar here so I'm going to say get a key once you go in here it says some information regarding the keys such as if you want to get the free one you can have a limit of twenty five thousand visits per day or per hour I don't quite remember it inside your website but for now the free one can suffice with whatever need we have so I'm just going to go ahead and click get a key and once we do that we can actually go ahead and create the name file project T I'm just going to say tutorial you guys can call whatever you want whoops that was spelled incorrect like so and I can go ahead and say create an enable API so once we do this it's going to go ahead and load up a key for us to use inside our code and we're going to go ahead and keep this key because you need to use it in order to actually get the Google Maps activated inside our website so once it's loaded which it should be in a few seconds there we go I'm going to go ahead and copy this key we have here and paste it inside my code and for now I'm just going to go and paste it down here because we don't actually need to have it here but we need to have it ready for when we do actually insert the line of code we need to use the key so we need to do one more thing here we need to go underneath the script we created and create a second script and the script is going to be the one that accidie allow for us to use the Google Maps inside our website so I'm going to go inside the script tag inside the first one at least and I'm going to go and say space async space defer or defer space source which is equal to double quotes and then inside of here we're going to go and write in the actress to Google's API so we're going to say HTTP colon forward slash forward slash maps.google.com forward slash maps /j s question mark key is equal to and then we need to paste in the key we just got from the website so I'm just going to take it here copy it delete it because we don't need it anymore and insert it right after the equal sign so now we have the key inserted we need to finish off the code by writing and callback is equal to in it map with a Big M ok so that actually cut the video here because I realize we've got to insert one word inside the link here right after maps when we say forward slash we need to API forward slash and then Jas question mark so now that we have this we can actually go and save it go inside our browser refresh and as you guys can see we now get a map now this map works perfectly fine we can zoom in we can zoom out using the mouse control if you want to we can zoom in using the buttons here but right now we don't actually have a pointer or like a marker that says where in the world we are so going inside our code again we're going to go ahead and include that so inside the script we have up here we're going to go ahead and go underneath the last code we just wrote and we're going to go ahead and create another variable we're going to call this one marker I'm going to set it equal to new Google dot dot marker with a Big M parenthesis and then inside the parentheses we're going to say curly brackets I'm going to go ahead and just move it down to the next line so we get the closing curly bracket and a closing parenthesis on the line below here and inside of here we're going to go ahead and include two pieces of data first of all the position like so which is going to refer to the location we have up here because it makes sense to just include the location that we actually decide down here inside the same place where the mark is going to be so I'm going to say location by the way I don't think I explained this one up here because this one up here's the center just basically says where the map need to be centered once we load the website so right now as you guys can see the latitude longitude in my case is Australia so what we can do here is we can actually go and set the marker in the same location as Australia so I'm going to go and say we have another piece of data which is going to be map which is going to refer to the map you have up here and we want to tell that this is a map so now we have this we can actually go ahead and close off the code we have down here with a semicolon and then we can go and reload the map and as you guys can see we now have a pointer that we can actually you know zoom in on so we know where exactly we want the user to to find us so this is basically how to insert a Google API map and again we can do all sorts of things and again we can actually insert this map wherever you want inside our web sites I just decided to just insert it inside an empty browser so you guys can go ahead and take the code and just use it for whatever purpose you for example your own website if you want to so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time
