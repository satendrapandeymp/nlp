hello friends this is Sagar Murray from southern marauding and today in this video I am going to explain you what is CSS what are different types of theater and how to apply a CSS to your web page so what does it mean by CSS CSS stands for cascading style sheets cascading style sheet is a style sheet language will call describing the presentation of document returning in markup language such as HTML CSS is a rule-based language that applies a link to your HTML element you can write CSS rules in element and modify properties of those elements such as color background colors with border thickness on size etc CSS helps developers to create visually angling web pages and user interfaces for web applications CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various else's property CSS has some variations or words like CSS one CSS to here's a 2.1 and now the independence we are using PHP CSS 3 is the latest version in some additional features and properties are introduced there are three types of cases the first one is in like user and inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element and in my theater uses the style attribute of an HTML element the second type is internal sizing which is also called as embedded CSS an internal style sheet is the section of a HTML page that contains style decoration internal style states are defined by using style tags between the head area of the document and the third type is external CSS an external style sheet is a file containing only CSS syntax the style information is not exclusively tied directly to the document element so selector spintax is used to specify what Styles attached to which portion of the document page so these are the types of fearful so I have a basic dot HTML created in my ability so I will open eclipse non-fertile occurs so this is the structure that we are going to format now so as you can see here reading paragraph anchor tag and investigation protein molecule so there are three types of phases the first one is inline paper so inline CSS you the type of CSS which we applied to the element so take an example of this heading element so with the help of inline CSS we can actually apply CSS to a element directly without using the style tag so here is the example so if I want to apply a background color to heading type then with the help of internal pages I will write a code like this so first of all you should write style then is equal to in double quotes the property name in this case I want to apply a background color so it will be background hello Poland and the value of the property so in this case suppose I want to apply a big seller to this heading there so there are many ways to do this we can write RGB color code we can write hexadecimal color code all we can write the colors new mixer so let me write the coloring so let me save it and so as you can see here the pink color got applied here so likewise if I want to align edge to the center so this is the text which is heading 1 so I have to write text align text align is a property which aligns the depth so there are values like left right and center so here in this case I want to align it to the center so you give her a bottle and cycle let's go back and do some other stuff so the default text color is the black so suppose if I want to apply a green color to the text I will write color so that is the property change the color of the text : the value would be color name RGB values or excitation code Here I am writing the color mean green semicolon and let's check the output yes so here is green color got applied so this was the example of inline CSS so the second type is internal fuses so by default in line cases has more priority about internal fuses or external field so let's take the internal CSS example also so if you want to apply internal thickness you should apply in Penryn CSS in the header section with the help of style tag you should close the started so there are some standards that we need to follow while writing interval just like we should write type so type will be 'text slash Pierce's we should also write relation the relation is style fit if you don't write these there are so it will not give you any error because the browser is smart enough to understand the missing code and corrected itself so let's go ahead and write some here so take an example of this voltage so if I want to apply a background color to this body then I will write ball which is the tag name then background-color and we cover the color name that we you want to apply so in this case if i wanted to apply sky-blue color if I replace the page then it will show you sky blue column see the sky blue color contact line here let me show you one example of CSS priority so as I said before the inline CSS will have more priority about internal or external filter so as you can see here the pillar is green on the first day other the Headington has practiced so what I'm going to do here I will write this one and the color name [Music] so if I write seller name as rate so what do you think will it change the color of this heading one text or is it going to keep the green color which is applied here so it will not apply red color to this heading ten because in line style sheet has more priority about internal or external filter so let me show you this see still it is in green so it has not changed too ridiculous but there is a big business you can actually apply the red color even if the green color is given in inline styling so to do this we have to use the keyword important important is the keyword which overrides the default property value and form the CSS to apply whichever value is v1 before the important Kiba so in this case the rate seller will get applied now because the important keyword is written let me show you this [Music] see now the redditor a decline okay so this was the example of internal cases there is another theory which is called as external casing external CSS present in external side further we need to first create external cases so let me create a blank document first okay here we do not need to write started because this file itself tells the browser that it is external filter which is extension which is dot CSS so let me go ahead and save this file so here I would like to give it a name as l dot CSS it should not be a text file so the extension is self saying that it is a CSS file or will be not to write time database but I am NOT including this side or theater into the key equation to do so we have to write link tag link is the tag to load external CSS into your web page again the type of Link's which is text slash CSS again the relation solution is statute and the hypertext reference attribute so this is the path of our CSS file you know get it is encoded so I will write style not see this okay I have to write some CSS in this external CSS file to make sure whether the file got included in our web page or not so I'm in right body tag again and background plus so let us write brown color so for now the sky blue color is also given in the body type so which color will get apply in this situation the intervals here six colors will get applied because internal cases has more priority over external surfaces let me save this [Music] so sighs no color is the default we should be have given in internal senses so it will not change now as I said before we can use important keyboard also to override the default values so here I have written important keyword and it's just a matter of this so brown color multiplied actually it does not look good so let me change it to great let me run this so this was the example to show you serious priority and how external is to work so I do not require this code now so let's go ahead and and write some other CSS so take an example of this paragraph tag so by default paragraph has no text decoration and I am going to write a text evaporation property for paragraph set so for that I need to write P tags then cut the list is open and close in between them then I should write text decoration and underline is the property there are many powers of let me show you something [Music] now the paragraph tag has got underline so it means that you can give as much as a property that you want to apply to the particular element and this is how external CSS internal CSS and inline CSS works so friends make sure that you watch my other tutorials also so if you like this video click on
