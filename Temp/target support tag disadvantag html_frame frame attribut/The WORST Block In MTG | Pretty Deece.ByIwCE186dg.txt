all right we're talking about the worst block in the history of magic but most importantly this is about me it's about me being mad at the stuff that happened to me as a kid that I wasn't old enough to know to be mad at yet the sense I'm going to talk about took advantage of a dumb child me and probably hundreds of thousands more kids around the world I'm talking of course about the Merc ad and masks Bach masks Nemesis prophecy these sets are complete trash but why are they so bad I'll get to the cards in a bit but just to get some context it's time for a little history lesson from alliances in summer 96 to Exodus in summer 98 Magic's R&D department was on a roll the power levels on individual cards were pushed but nothing proved too broken as successful sets kept piling up on top of each other development was seen less and less as a necessity and more and more of a tedious thing that anyone can do so why throw more resources at it our designers are killing it anyway the gravy train ground to a halt with the release of verses saga in the fall of 98 originally intended to be an enchantment themed block the mechanics highlighted a nurse's saga committed three critical sins many of the cards circumvented mana costs or made absurd amounts of mana many of the cards drew too many cards to easily and finally there are too many one card engines which is to say too many cards allowed one resource to be transformed into another way too easily by the timer's is destiny the last set in the block was released a tonne of cards got banded standard in the wake of all of this Peter Adkison the CEO of wizards the coast at the time famously called mark rosewater and the rest of Rd up to his office and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they screwed magic up this badly ever again they'd be fired because banning a bunch of cards and standard is bad for business knowing that would it surprise you if I told you that the follow-up to ursus destiny was by most metrics a horrible set would it shock you to discover that a handful of nerds with a dream job making magic cards saw their lives flash before their eyes in a meeting with the guy that signs their paychecks had decided to play things a little more conservatively you now have the appropriate context for Acadian masks released in fall 1999 where KD and masks pushed the wrath cycle out of standard and saying goodbye to a bunch of banned cards along with it five cards remain banned but hey this half the amount of banned cards is before noise let's take a look at some of the mechanics highlighted in Merck ad in masks probably the most popular one is rebels which are pretty absurd and ended up dominating block constructed like few archetypes ever have combining tutoring with circumventing casting costs rebels made sure every game looked pretty much the same Castro motion sergeant sergeant gets lieutenant lieutenant gets captain captain gets commander commander gets sky marshal on and on and up and up the chain goes take a look at this cycle of uncommon creatures these things are atrocious for the low low cost of form Anna you too can deploy a hill giant that will just give your opponent as many spells as their heart desires maybe you would like to give your opponent a bunch of free jumps maybe you would like to give them some free tremors how about free mind peels or maybe stave offs now you can give any of these mediocre spells to your opponent absolutely free of charge wow what a bargain these cards are garbage I never thought my line of work would ever include having to explain that giving your opponent free spells is bad but just trust me it's bad speaking of bad check out this cycle of nonsense this cycle represents a particularly virulent philosophy of early magic design where creatures basically weren't allowed to be good to make something as innocuous as a 4/4 4/4 back in 1999 it needed to have a ginormous drawback which all five of these definitely bring to the table you get a 3/3 flyer for four and your opponent gets whatever the hell they want these cards are garbage I don't think any cards in this set are worse than these three I mean these things are bad to a degree that there's just no point to them can you imagine playing in a tournament and saying hello opponent here is my three three four four it is a rare you may pay three mana at any time to kill it dead thereby firmly dunking me into the core of the earth if the point of these cards is not solely to trip up newer players and I don't know what the goal of these cards is they are flabbergasting ly bad well a lot of the cards are indeed unplayable Merc ad and masks did contain cards that are good but ultimately they're powerful in a way that doesn't really promote enjoyable gameplay example the best card in the set is Rashaad in port which can best be described as a land that sometimes doubles as a temporary stone rain it's certainly nowhere near the power level of wasteland or strip mine but its efficiency and the fact that it's colorless meant that almost every deck played it when a card like rashad in port is ubiquitous games aren't much fun it created an environment where its controller paid to deny their opponent a resource turn after turn the whole friggin goal of the card is that neither player is able to play magic look the cards and myrrh kadian masks are predicated on the hope that what's happening on the battlefield is important and also the creatures are the crux of the decks hilariously this completely ignores the fact that the creatures the set puts forth are without exception terrible even rebels suck their value is just derived from the fact that they're all inherent card advantage engines urges toggle block didn't help matters the way its cards play out nothing on the battlefield makes a difference it's all just combos and resource denial and engines trust me yaagh mouths bargain does not care about you're free one two just doesn't Nemesis released February 2000 is probably the best set of the three which is like saying the chicken fingers are more delicious than a spare tire and rat poison it introduced fading which is under nonsense Hey look you paid all this mana for a card it's going away now bye-bye card so dumb there are maybe four decent cars with fading and the rest are all very degrees of useless I have vivid memories of this thing for example holy smokes it's a 10/10 if I could just hit them with this thing twice it's over that is true and thanks to fading you only get two bites at the Apple so good luck little letdown basically if your opponent did pretty much anything at all the giant idiot you invested seven men and two is rendered useless here's the thing creatures needed a lot of help from nemesis and nemesis responded by giving all the good creatures built-in detonation devices not great let's talk about this cycle of enchantments parallax Nexus is horrible but parallax wave and tide were the final pieces of a truly annoying deck built around replenish and attunement here's how it works attuma lets you churn through your deck dumping a bunch of stuff into the graveyard parallax wave and parallax tide cut opponents off of their resources temporarily and it doesn't need to be permanent because soon enough you're gonna tomb it enough times to fuel a ginormous replenish and oh look at that opalescence is in your graveyard too so now all these enchantments are also ginormous creatures that can attack letting you win the game in one fell swoop replenish happens to be the first deck I ever played against Anna sanction match and my trusty mercenary deck in tow and I got slaughtered my opponent Shane relax ties together meaning I never got access to any lands and attunement filled their graveyard quickly enough to dunk on me with a replenish that I had no way of stopping because my deck was full of terrible mercenaries that did nothing to stop my opponent in any way but if I'm being honest I really just had no clue what was going on I was 11 my opponent moved a bunch of cards around really fast and at some point I was informed that I had lost the deck was not very beginner friendly there was no way for eleven-year-old John to make the jump from starter and pre-constructed next to that it was truly disheartening and it was my first ever sanctioned match to this day I have no clue why I kept playing magic after that I think my skull was still soft which brings us to prophecy boy is is set atrocious for my money there's no set worse than prophecy and I should know when I picked up my set of starter to learn how to play magic the prophecy pre-release was going on the same days so yeah I have a lot of experience with these sets back before invasion sets mechanics were often internally competitive quick example tempest had by back and shadow one mechanic is lightning fast shadow was another form of evasion since shadow creatures were all aggressive the mechanic tended to wrap games up quickly by back is a slow plodding mechanic sink a lot of mana into this spell and you can have it back the advantage comes at a steep mana cost but you can parlay that into a way to take control over a game the two mechanics don't play very well with each other ones controlling and ones aggressive it's a weird way to make sets they don't do it much anymore the sum total of prophecies internally competitive mechanics equaled an environment where no one got to play magic the first mechanic is ristic spells most of them had ristic in their names but also extended to cards like glittering lion and ribbon snake basically these cards have an effect or an ability and your opponent can pay some amount of mana to take them away sometimes the simple act of your opponent paying mana has a drastic effect on what your spell does take this card if your opponent pays 3 it does nothing you have literally cast a sorcery that says target opponent taps 3 lands ristic cave mystic cave Rishta cave-like the flailing idiots former kadian masks is beyond the pale in terms of pointlessness I refuse to believe that someone playtesting prophecy in order to get the set ready for a wide release patristic cave onto the battlefield multiple times determined that they were happy with its impact on gameplay and shipped it along with the other 142 toilet cards to the printer I cannot believe this happened what kind of bad this card is if your opponent has won mana open something that happens quite often in games of magic this card no longer has text 1 on tap to mana it's not the highest bar to clear the other thing prophecy cards do is they let you sacrifice lands or tap out to do stuff how clever one of the mechanics needs me to pay mana in order to stop a mediocre spell and the other mechanic allows me to be less likely to pay mana and stop my opponent's mediocre spells this set is just one big stupid red herring you have to figure that at this point R&D wasn't even concerned with whether or not the games were fun but rather whether or not they were breaking the game asunder through that lens prophecy was a wild success I'll frame it another way imagine getting your $10 allowance bringing it down to your LG s5 3 packs and opening veteran brawler shrouded serpent and salmon sanctuary one thing that happens is that you learn to stop buying packs pretty quickly I never understood people who bought boosters over singles and recently I realized that it was because I started playing during sets where I was literally impossible to ever open a good card there was no lottery to win in prophecy why they're open crap or crap I played in tournaments and got dunked on week after week and as my opponents joyfully pointed out nonsense like denying wind and coffin puppets weren't exactly helping me break the cycle despite all this I'm gonna show you guys my commander deck it is a Senate Emin car and it's a Senate Evan card because the whole deck is masks block constructed commander I've never been really been interested in commander but all my friends play it and I wanted to play with them so I wanted something that was a and capable of winning and B would remind me of dumb child as opposed to the dumb adult sitting in front of you reflection is a gift and looking back on who you used to be can be painful but I think it behooves all of us to have a sense of humor about it and I'll give an example this thing is a 4-3 flier for four and during your upkeep you have to pay for or it dies because you couldn't make a for power flier for four back then without it like Armageddon 'you or burning down your house or whatever I I don't know I just think it's funny thanks for watching I'll see you next time
