[Music] hi guys welcome to nourish a Technologies this is subbaraj in this video session will will try to view that inline elements these inline elements applaud popularly known as block level elements these elements exclusively we are using for indicating a specific line or lines for example you can take your mark attack mater attack and another one is time tag most important progress total in line elements are classified here four types every element its oh one boundary is there for example if you are taking mark mark exclusively to highlight the text for example in such engine you type html5 video tutorials wherever the keyword existed you are seeing with the highlight color yellow that is a mark actually for example you open one MS Word document you type to control F and you entered for example RHIT in the document wherever narration a availability is coming in background ello color so this is nothing but mark mark is nothing but highlighting the text from other text so it is showing particularly the user reference now that practically we can see before we are entering into practical it is used for indicating textures markers are highlighted for reference purposes this tag is used to highlighting as I said already the highlighted text get the much more emphasis emphasis means italics tail also available highlighted one and it is a paid tag mark oprand mark close there is no attributes available specific if you are going to apply we can apply global attributes right practically we can that inline elements and for example html5 is new markup language new markup language for latest web applications like that I entered now once you entered I want to highlight html5 simply open market act and close the mark tag and once you closer that it is highlighting that html5 word yes I light it this is mark usage in this page wherever html5 available I want iolite yes definitely we can write selector or we can write JavaScript but particularly statically I am showing to you is it possible to change the color or is it possible to highlight another word yes definitely if you want to highlight another word the same mark you can take and latest web applications so latest I want to highlight so take that wherever you require you can copy paste now let us highlight it can we change this color definitely because global attribute is their style equal to background the color background the color I am giving a light green so that that color is going to light green and latest so like this whenever we are going to change the colors happily we can highlight the particular area now for example you want to change the color of the text also definitely color I want random now black available red so using global attribute this mark tag we can implement in different different areas so but you remember it is an inline element not for multiple lines so that point you need to remember while you are implementing in the project so finally using CSS only how to develop that now come back now I am using using CSS style I am taking style text or CSS now inside for example I am using mark as per your requirement what is the mark means already explained but in this situation mark is selector please what is selector why selector means please refer my CSS videos before you are coming to html5 compulsory you must watch HTML CSS videos otherwise that Here I am unable to discuss again what is selector which is a completely mark level so mark and I am here background the color so now background color not provided for example only marks provided so body level mark is their style I am removing right there is no style here mark right refresh and a mark is the tag here mark only existed now without anything that cascading type executed by default displaying a low color and you can observe them on now mark available here and I said background color red I said okay now you can observe now I am showing I am showing that select our level previously shown only image that is completely related to only style level so this is completely mark is select our level now in this select our level for example I want same color multiple times for example I required maintain break different areas you required also means maintain multiple breaks and refresh that and I want different words I want to make sure that okay definitely so we'll see different words only we'll try to highlight first let me highlight html5 okay let me highlight for example applications so three areas with the same color and closed closed right so latest and where available first one second one is and third 1/3 1/2 times I provided latest I provided as well as applications I provided good so these are the things wherever my words are viable different of no I want only particular vote only multiple times yes the uses you can use particular word time only multiple times so this is a mark tag mark is nothing but only highlighting the text so the second tag is beta what exactly meter what are the attributes existed for that we can see meter defines scalar measurement within the known range or a fractional value means we can use value is equal to 9.0 like that also we can write a fractional value means a decimal that is means floating values this is also known as gas and I said displaying a scalar measurement within the known range like hard drive usage whatever this force is also available query results available for example executor one query the query is executed for example how many paths how many failed like that you want to show with the meter tag these many members passes many fail these many warning these many attendants well or something we are giving so that kind of means this meta element represents Cal our measurement scalar in the sense it is a strategy means it is not changing dynamically every second so the point I want to show you very clear it is a paid tag and paid that and come down here I wrote very clearly the note point easier in my working experience of my projects a meter tag should not be used to indicate progress because progress is a dynamic one mater is a static one in the static dynamic usage is not possible right we can see attributes attribute wherever available we can try to form high low max min min after optimum available optimum generally we are using for the decimal numbers so floating values we are using practically I will show you that one value also existed now one by one metric in Plymouth where in the live environment we are using this meta tags directive meter and meter I am using so meter inside something I should require I am writing here paragraph paragraph oops your browser not supporting not supporting I will show you this message meaning also not a supporting meter tag a bit and try update and try good so I am providing here in between this style is equal to color red and font family also I am giving little bit neatly display that one Tahoma and font size also I am going to use here font size for example pixels so once you are using 30 pixels back now I am going to refresh meta tag already used is a plain meter the completely empty meter so meter is nothing but my heart disc nothing occupied completely fully free okay right now I want to put enable here label is a form element so label label level I'm saying 5% full out of full out of 10% okay now that practically I can show you label and break that now output will see before output also meta tag is ready and little bit colorful will make that okay right code so now I am giving style equal to not sell first value equal to five and a max equal to 10 right once that is there that is a simple one so 5% this total is 10% 5% also other occupied green color means more space existed it indicates itself more space existed so 5% occupied that and I am giving meta tag inside okay this is I am leaving I am not showing much though I am executing the same example other browsers for example I am taking that Mac means Apple Safari once you are going to take Apple Safari and it is giving see oops your browser not supporting means what if browser supports meta tag will display like this observe please may detect displace like this if browser not supports the related oops message display means what you understood here so in from my from my source code from my source code two ports get execute here when when supporting this part will be executed when not supporting this part will be executed okay this is whatever available that is doesn't require we are not related to now style right if remove also nothing affected is happy and your also nothing affected happy so now once that is completed now I want to modify this as per colors when colors are coming when should colors should be applicable now come down to the colors will read the note point if the value is higher than high the Gaggia is red red the gajj is red okay now next when low available and next one the value is more than either optimum is yellow and Max available these two node points you need to remember first let me show what is that red color and completely full color I am showing to you right this made already implemented just I am removing that that's all enough nothing is there and value also hundred because you required red when low available and low is there 69 and I am refreshing that observe 10% out of ten percent full hard-disk nothing free excellent is a perfect output means what you are understanding here can we save any file here right now no you know already that because it is giving red color red color means there is no space in that practically you can play step by step out I am showing example to you right yes we can see the next one so I need a low color in local of node point we can try to observe that all that is shown to be very clearly if value is more than high then optimum is yellow so when optimum is a low then we need to understand that so I'm again I'm taking that only when available high and previous major attack I am overwriting that right already forever element is a reasonable first and how much nine percent only occupied here I am giving value ninety percent so that I am giving nine percent out of ten so you are getting one kind of clarity it is a low yes almost helpful ready to complete so it is giving one warning message to you generally 90 industry mainly software industry more important in the web environment area yellow color or orange color indicates warning to you so it is giving one warning my dear tortoise 10% space is their main person already occupied only tempt wasn't existed please take care about that that is giving for example I am developing one each a shopping mall card for example ecommerce one for example some kind of tutorials related up side for example RHIT dot-com for example bashful are completed so there is no other there is no admission in that batch I am displaying radical up so new batch I am giving again day there only and for example product is that 20 quantity available already 18 already sold out warning I'm giving means please hurry ready now green color full stock is there no problem so like that mater tag has a several usage on the webpage in different different areas so by default green color and a lo color and red color so where we are using as per the client business requirement we are implementing these meta tag uses on specific environment area now we can come to optimum story so what exactly optimum where we are using simple point director understanding of optimum is only we are using for the floating point n numbers floating point is nothing but where decimal numbers are viable their optimum required if decimal value is not their optimum design required is very solid and note point also for you now I am taking that simple note point directly because without time wasting typing all the things just I I develop with that a single line example I am showing to you that cell and value 3 put 0.3% I am giving 0.3% and 20.9% means total I am occupying 5% 0.5 watts occupying that so 0.5 right and I will show you grid that's one simple so optimum uses vendors should very clearly so this is about your mater attack so market AGG meter tag I am going to dynamic one progress progress very simple so for example you are coming to progress if I posit occupied out of 10 percent very good and now progress I'm providing here progress every second increasing and progress again that progress progress inside I am writing max 10 percent value just 5 so once you are giving 10 5 in between if you want note point also can apply that is up to you just we can see that every second how it is going to be increased that progress maximum value minimum value so whenever we are going to increase progress no meter code right now progress implementation level also we need to observe how the syntax available yeah this maxvalue so progress level right refresh now every second bar is coming quarter 10% 5% unoccupied see the blood the blood is nothing but progress so it is showing to you some file downloading some file installing some set of still going on that is that kind of sense is there now you want to observe here some kind of colorful see in your hands everything style is equal to color 0lu or whatever the color you require just I am displaying radical yes also right a color displayed now I want to change the font yes we can semicolon font family please see the videos of CSS for better understanding of my current example right perfect now I want to increment total 10% you can't see any blur now yes right refresh now right there is no blur now observe like that only a few a few seconds blood is not coming so progress 10% of oil is 10% full it is not showing anything means file downloaded successfully a file successfully installed so like that we can show the message and finally we can see the time tag so generally we are writing tomorrow tomorrow there is a session tomorrow there is a station at 9:00 a like that 9:00 a.m. as per is T so this is I want to display on my web page definite it is correct tomorrow there is a session at 9:00 a.m. it is not it is not any grammatical mistake no is not there it is a perfect statement you are running perfectly displayed then what you are talking now that that is all is the story whenever we are writing time time must not be a number it must be a time so that time you must use time tag otherwise as per SEO your information is incorrect maybe there is a chance Google caller is going to take as a number that time if anybody type that time related google searching your web page unable to come ranking wise there is a problem html5 is not only design development UI you need to view as a programmer as per se were no marketing no website marketing is the most so as a programmer as a developer first you need to take care about what exactly the rules and regulations output is not changing you observed our man with the time without a mass of output same but I am indicating my source code is indicating to my Google or my gy m other explains you am Google Yahoo MSN so it indicates what exactly the data is related to so this is a whatever inline elements or block level elements thank you for watching my videos for more videos log in on
