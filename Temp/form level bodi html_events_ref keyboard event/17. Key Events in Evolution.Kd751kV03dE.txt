okay we're in the middle of the section on macro-evolution we've had three lectures about macro evolutionary principles speciation how to build a a tree and then what kinds of uses you can put a phylogenetic tree to now we're going to do three lectures on different ways to look at the history of life and the first cut the first lecture the one today is a abstract conceptual view of the history of life and it looks at it as a series of major transitions in the organization of life and how information is transmitted and this is the structure of the lecture we'll talk about what life is how we think it originated the origin of cells and eukaryotes some other key events and then we'll summarize with the principles that are involved in key events and major transitions in evolution well life is basically anything that has the properties of multiplication variation in heredity plus metabolism so it's not necessarily carbon-based or silicon based or based on anything else it has these abstract properties and what we really mean by metabolism is something about thermodynamics a living thing that has metabolism is using free energy that it's getting from the environment and it's using that to maintain a partially isolated system it's a local system your body is a partially isolated local system and it's doing so to keep it in an ordered State it's preserving the information that evolution and development have given it and doing so against an entropy gradient so basically we eat energy and we excrete entropy and the next you're looking at the toilet flushing down think about all that entropy that you're putting down into the system okay so this this is what metabolism does now if you try to do experiments in the laboratory in which you're watching the evolution of RNA molecules or if you try to do in silico experiments in the computer in which you are looking at the origin of structures and and that can get to be pretty sophisticated stuff you're not dealing with a living system that's that's artificial because with the RNA we're providing the metabolism we're putting the ATP and the enzymes into the test tubes and in programs for artificial life the things that are evolving in the computer are actually getting their energy from the basically from the electrical cable that we've got plugged into the wall feeding the computer so if you can get independent of any human intervention any system that's got multiplication variation in heredity so the basics to make natural selection work and you can arrange metabolism then it's going to start to evolve and it will be alive so our problem is to figure out how did this all get going the first major transition was the transition from an abiotic world to a living world the origin of life and to do that we had to get multiplication variation heredity and metabolism and the answer is increasingly that it is likely that metabolism came first and that heredity and multiplication came second variation was probably there from the start so I'm going to actually dwell on some things that are now chemically fairly trivial and some things that are logically non-trivial and involved paradoxes because this is an area that we know it did happen and we can now break down the steps in increasing detail but important things are not understood so the environment at the origin gosh I went through this thing yesterday and I got all the words on it and then I start talking and they're not there so the environment at the origin the Big Bang is now dated at about thirteen point five billion years it was just a few years ago it was tainted dated at twenty billion years so the universe as we know it is a bit younger than I had thought a decade ago and in stars the nuclei of all of the elements were synthesized out of hydrogen basically and some of the novae and supernovae created things that are heavier than iron and a lot of that is important cofactors for enzymes in your body you could not actually function biochemically as you do if you did not have things that had been cooked up in the explosions of giant stars now the solar system is formed basically from recycled star stuff about five to four and a half billion years ago and there's intense planetoid bombardment of the inner planets going on at that time nothing could have living could have existed on the face of the earth because temperatures were simply too high the surface of the planet was really a toxic wasteland of boiling lava and very very extreme temperatures and PHS the initial atmosphere got blown off the moon was formed possibly because of the impact of a large planetoid that hit the forming earth and actually blew a chunk of it off and at that point the earth had short days it was spinning very rapidly it had condensed from a cloud of stuff and as it fell in it brought angular momentum into the system and so the earth started off with a higher rotation speed speed than it currently has then about a billion years after the planet forms the atmosphere is reducing the temperature has fallen to where liquid water can exist on the surface of the planet and life probably originates on a positively charged mineral surface and it seems now likely that it was probably at a deep hydrothermal vent so there was a hot high-pressure acid around a positively charged mineral surface there was a lot of chemical energy at that interface we don't know that for sure but this does seem to be the kind of a context in which you can get certain chemical reactions to work that won't work elsewhere so you need the building blocks of life you need linear lipids they can make membranes and they can make compartments you need amino acids to make proteins you need purines and pyrimidines to make nucleotides you need sugars and phosphates to link things together and so there's a branch of origin of life research that specializes in the chemical conditions under which you'll get these building blocks and then after you get the building blocks and get them to work together you need things that will make copies of themselves so if you can get reproduction variation in reproductive success some kind of inheritance then natural selection will take over if you can get some kind of primitive genetic molecule it can get honed into an RNA or a DNA structure if you can get some kind of primitive cell with a very simple membrane then it natural selection can hone it into a selective filter where there are pores in the cell that lets certain things in and out and so forth so you have to have you can start with fairly simple things and natural selection will refine them fairly rapidly but you have to start with at least these simple things so that's kind of a bootstrap operation you've got to get those first replicators up and running before natural selection will take over and create complexity and precision and and make it into a sophisticated system so how do you get the building blocks well there were some very interesting experiments done by a grad student at the University of Chicago Stanley Miller working with Harold Urey and what basically he did was he would put methane nitrogen ammonia ammonia chloride he would put in carbon monoxide nitrogen hydrogen different kinds of mixtures into a vessel and then he would pass an electric spark through it and he found that it was fairly easy to get these amino acids to fall out and by the way most of this guy's PhD thesis consisted not of performing that experiment but of doing the analytical chemistry afterwards to convince everybody that this was actually what he had got okay in 1953 that was not so easy we didn't have all these beautiful gas chromatographs and whatnot can do the identifications okay so the basic structure of this is that you make something out of fairly small simple molecules likely to be in the atmosphere or in the water on the surface of the earth four point three and a half to four billion years ago and you give it some energy in the form of an electric charge or you heat it or whatever and you see what comes out so amino acids are pretty easy when I was 15 years old I was fascinated by this experiment in high school and I tried to repeat it and I blew up the chemistry lab and I produced a toxic cloud of cyanide gas which you can get out of these guys and that caused the evacuation of the entire building with 200 students sitting outside on the lawn in the middle of the morning classes deeply satisfactory okay so we have a bit of ambivalence on this issue of abiotic synthesis some things we get real easy okay we got amino acids fatty acid sugars and and furies pretty easily some things are hard so primitive nucleosides ribose is not so easy a linear long-chain fatty acid that you might find really useful for making a membrane that's not so easy and it's not easy to get these things all in the same synthetic environment so you have to imagine that well perhaps we're getting different chemical reactions going on different micro environments and they're mixing somehow but then once we got the building blocks you run into what is not a chemical synthesis problem you run into an abstract logical problem okay that's the error threshold so the amount of information that you can maintain by selection is limited by copying fidelity basically what that says is that if you have a very high mutation rate you are destroying all of the information that you've accumulated and you're not transmitting enough of it to the next generation to be able to usefully accumulate information on how to do something better so that's the error threshold you if you don't really have high copying fidelity then mutations will kill you and if you have a small genome basically if you have a small genome that's big enough to do something it can actually have a higher mutation rate than a large genome a small genome is small enough so that the probability of a mutation at any one place in it is fairly small a big genome is extremely likely to have a bunch of mutations so there's a relationship between size and the size of the genome and the amount of mutation that can be tolerated so Manford eigen he's a German guy who got a Nobel Prize for his work in biochemistry was thinking about the origin of life and he said well the relevant mutation rate is non enzymatic replication we're going to be making copies of molecules and at the origin there aren't any enzymes anymore okay where enzymes are things that are produced by living systems we don't have them I have to imagine ourselves back into the situation where we don't have enzymes but we want replication and for that it turns out he did the calculations the maximum genome size is about a hundred nucleotides so if we're dealing with replication of a DNA like or an RNA like molecule you can only get up to a genome of about 30 amino acids with the kinds of mutation rates you get with non enzymatic replication well that's much much too small for an enzyme you're not going to get an enzyme out of that anything bigger than that you need to make the replication more accurate and in order to make it more accurate you need an enzyme you need translating machinery to take the genome and make it into that enzyme you need the enzyme then to be working on making the genome replicate accurately and that takes a lot more than 100 nucleotides it takes more like a thousand to ten thousand nucleotides to construct any of the things that we know of now they can do that and so you can't get enzymes without a big genome and you can't get a big genome without enzymes if it catch-22 or are you gonna go so eigen tried to cook up a way out of this and he called it hyper cycles and the word hyper immediately makes you think of something that's almost quasi metaphysical it's nothing complicated okay here's what a hyper cycle is each one of these little things here is a chemical reaction and this little loop that I'm pointing at where B is making something that's making more B indicates that B is actually capable of making more of itself it's a chemical reaction that can make more of itself and there are a lot of such chemical reactions often in a chemical reaction you'll get product out of one side plus some other stuff that's like what you started with and this big dark arrow here indicates that some of what B makes is actually a precursor for C so C needs something that B is making and it takes it and makes more of itself and then it ships something on that D needs to make more of itself and D takes that makes more of itself and ship something on that makes a etc okay so if you can set up it's called a hyper cycle because it's a cycle with cycles inside of it it's a cycle of cycles the rate at which any one of these can replicate increases with the amount of product that's being given to it by any of the others and that means that B can make more B if it's getting more from a seek and make more see if it's getting more from B that means that in order to function the elements have to cooperate for substrate they can't compete for substrate they have to take what they need and pass some on and if this is then going to get refine and become more sophisticated and perhaps get to the point where it acquires an information molecule like DNA then it has to competitively exclude other such systems you could imagine a surface at a hot thermal event 3.5 billion years ago with many different such things a high degree of variation in just tiny little micro local chemical reaction systems and if this is ever going to bootstrap life and get underway then it has to be isolated and in a compartment and start competing with other such systems because only then will natural selection kick in there is a problem with this kind of thing it's just sitting there in its happy hot thermal event taking its chemical energy out of the environment and it's open it's an open system a selfish mutant could invade and destroy it somebody could come in who was say an alternate version of C and take stuff from B and make a lot more C but not ship anything on to D it could make a lot more C that would essentially be a selfish act okay that means taking but not giving back and in this system here an altruistic mutant won't spread and an altruistic means taking some and passing enough along so if this thing is open and it's not isolated from the environment any one of these steps in the hyper cycle could be invaded by a chemical alternative that would destroy the hyper cycle so these things are a model okay they we're not saying that this is what actually happened but it is a model of how a small group of cooperating molecules might have evolved before there was a genetic code if we could get them to be sufficiently complex then they would start competing with each other and then at a certain point in the complexity they might invent genes and have a competitive upper hand by being then being able to transmit the very the information on what was working so that would certainly give them an upper hand in competition and they would solve against Perry docks because each one has a small genome but in some they would add up to the information in a big genome so if you could somehow stabilize these small competitive systems so that they had internal cooperation but they were competing between themselves you could get life going so one way out of this problem of the invasion of mutants is to actually put them into compartments okay so you actually have to get the chemical reaction system isolated inside something like a membrane and that means it's a local group well are you finding certain things here resonating well the political scientist and he's interested in the interaction between cooperation within groups and competition between groups those basic ideas that actually resonate in economics and political science are there at evolutionary biology right at the origin of life in order to get this going in order to get the whole process going basically what you need to do is isolate one of those hyper cycles let it grow have some kind of division going on with some inheritance and then have a mutation that's going to improve one of the descendants so that this one that has a better hyper cycle can out-compete that one once you get that process going then you're going to retain cooperation within compartments you're going to increase competition between compartments and natural selection can take off and start to produce the very early primitive cells that's not so easy you got to get the compartments and there's some issues about the compartments you need them so that you can keep the co-operators on the inside and you can put the parasites the defectors on the outside so you can keep the guys that you like and you want to work with in there with you and you can tell the other guys to go away what this does it's associating cause with effect strongly in the sense that if you're cooperating and you are shipping your product on to the next member of the hypercycle that actually is an effect that's retained within the system and then comes back to help you if it's open you have no guarantee it's gonna come back to help you so there's no guarantee of reciprocity but if you can contain the cycle then reciprocity is going to occur because the cycle is shielded from the outside and it means that all of the elements in the cycle have a common stake in the success of the compartment they are all in the same boat they're all in it together if they get better at what they do together by cooperation they will improve their competition with the other similar things on the outside now we don't know where the long-chain fatty acids came from so I'm just going to pull them out of the air if you know we're back in Greek comedy deus ex machina a machine lowers a god onto the stage and he gives us one chain fatty-acids so we have our long-chain fatty acids and in fact we have a special kind they've got a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end there's a bo missing there that's hydrophobic so one end likes water in one end hates water and if you do that if you make those things and you throw them into water so you have an aqueous solution this is what you get these are things which are either micelles or primitive little spheroids or some times linear things that actually start looking pretty much like a biological membrane the fatty tails are sticking in and associating with each other and the hydrophilic parts are sticking out and associating with all of those nice charged water molecules well make a mixture of those things and then put in a surface so you have either the water surface or you have a mineral surface and this is what naturally happens this is called AB striction you will get a little bump forming we're talking about stuff that's there for free in the sense that you don't have to have any natural selection going on to give this to you in the chemical structures these things once you get them will do this spontaneously okay so you can get something like this happening this is a nice little sphere that's starting to bulge up off the surface and if you make them big enough they will divide so they will grow and they'll actually kind of start pulsing around a little bit just from Brownian motion and if you get these little spheroids that are lipid bilayers up to a certain size they will actually divide so you can see that it might not actually have been necessary for natural selection to arrange the first replication events for cellular compartments that might have been something that was just happening physically and chemically so that the part of the bootstrapping was there for free making it efficient making it good making it precise making it complicated that's a whole nother story that took a lot of evolution but just that very simple initial step of having a sphere of a bilipid membrane that had a hyper cycle in it maybe one in each compartment that would then divide that was probably there for free now if you want to make it grow then one of the things you want to put inside it is a hyper cycle that will make more membrane building blocks because that will just make this thing grow so perhaps that was actually the kind of chemical reaction that was going on you some of the early semi cells or protocells they were making the building blocks of lipid bilayers however then you've got a problem of how they get to sub the different substrates that you need in through the membrane that's the problem of membrane transport you gotta have a membrane you've gotta isolate your reactions so that they can be cooperative and not destabilized by parasites but once you've isolated them then you have the problem of moving things in and out through the membrane so there's got to be a period back at the origin of life during which membrane properties can evolve and that in a replicating entity that's not yet fully cut off from its environment and the solution to that one possible solution is a semi cell that would be you make a cup on the surface of the water or on the surface of a mineral and you don't completely close the perimeter so the things kind of leaky stuff can go in and out of the edges of the cup and that will solve the problem okay it'll is allows a partial openness it gives you a certain degree of control over who comes in and out and that that might have helped to adjust these early semi cells if you want to have a look at a fairly recent article this is now five years old Rasmussen was talking about transitions from nonliving to living matter in science and then this would be a good way in web of science to go and trace the more recent literature they will all all the more recent articles will almost certainly cite this one and then it also cites you back all the way to the miller-urey experiment in in 1953 so there is there's really growing interest in how a simple life form could be synthesized in the lab and there is a desire to see whether or not we can understand the origin of life well enough so that we can make alternate forms of life so that we can make self-replicating and self repairing nano machines and Druidry up at MIT runs an international competition every year where our bright young molecular geneticists and microbiologist get together and they try to engineer biological machines and the point of the competition is to try to make the most complex and sophisticated little biological machine that you can and he's got funding from MIT to bring these people from all over the world so every year there's an international competition and a team comes in from Beijing and a team comes in from Paris and if ul puts one together a team goes up from Yale and they all play with their biological machines which are at the scale of viruses and bacteria so out of this kind of creative play we may actually learn a lot that then applies back to the real origin of life rather than the geeky postmodern nano machine so I see some hope in that kind of playful research okay now I will wave my hands and a miracle occurs and it's later on in the evolution of life we're now going to discuss the prokaryotic eukaryotic transition and the prokaryotic eukaryotic transition is thought to be a major transition because it contains a significant change in the transmission of information every major transition and the evolution of life has consisted either of a difference in the way that genetic information was transmitted or and or in the unit of selection a thing that was actually evolving so both of those things are going on here what's going on in the transition from the prokaryotes up here to the eukaryotes down here is one thing that's going on is that you're going from an organism like a bacterium that has a single circular chromosome anchored to a cell wall to an organism that has a nucleus within which the chromosomes are and motile there are then often multiple chromosomes inside the nucleus plus organelles that are out in the cytoplasm plus a lot of cell structure that's simply not present in the prokaryotes so one of the things that you have is an organizing Center out of which actin filaments will grow and these are used to in meiosis and mitosis and associated with that organizing Center is a little circular chromosome which is actually thought to indicate that this was originally an independent bacterium and that these actin filaments are home Oliver Li homologous with a bacterial flagellum you have got vacuoles you've got into plasmic reticulum all kinds of stuff and all pro all eukaryotes if they have a cilium they have a characteristic 9+2 structure in the cilium and this is thought to have been constructed from multiple bacterial precursors and so forth so you've got compartments forming you've got organelles and you've got a difference in the way the genetic information is compartmentalized and transmitted so the prokaryotes have a rigid outer cell wall they have a circular chromosome attached to the cell wall and importantly the transcribed mRNA is translated directly you can see that here you can see the mRNA coming off of the DNA helix and you can see little ribosomes here chunking out protein that's the there are these little squiggly things whereas down here that process is being done at the endoplasmic reticulum and it's not direct it's indirect in the eukaryotes there's an internal cytoskeleton you've got lots of little micro environments that are giving you the opportunity to create local industry within the cytoplasm there are several linear chromosomes inside a nuclear envelope transcription and translation are separated and there are organelles and with eukaryotes you get meiosis so you get an or a precise and organized way of making genetically different offspring in each generation now in order to go from prokaryote to eukaryote you gotta lose your cell wall and that's a real issue because the cell wall in a bacterium is protecting it from swelling up and bursting like a balloon due to osmotic pressure so the bacterium is using a rigid cell wall to protect itself from the influx of water and in order to do that in order to lose the cell wall you need something to stabilize it on the inside and that's the cytoskeleton so the cytoskeleton is really an extremely important morphological invention in this transition yep well you would need to have cytoskeleton elements in the precursor wouldn't you you couldn't make the transition unless they were already there if you made the transition without them you would blow up so I'm not surprised that there are cytoskeletal elements in bacteria okay and remember it's three billion years later so a lot of stuff could have gone on in the bacteria oh I think that I think that what you're on to actually is an interesting system to see whether or not you could actually do experimental evolution what is the state of the cell wall in those bacteria you know they don't have a cell wall they have a normal cell wall if this idea is correct then of course it should be possible it might take a long time to experimentally select them to lose their cell walls but in order to do so they would probably have to organize their fibrils their cytoskeleton in a very precise way before they can do it just having them they're probably using it for some other reason just ought to read me I can't hear the last part of that cell wall synthesis some of the cytoskeleton is actually involved in cell wall synthesis so that would suggest that it was there for a long time that's that is actually how evolution works it invents things for one purpose and then takes advantage of them for another so what you're telling me is actually that this scenario now has all kinds of supporting information because the bacteria probably had evolved for a long time using the cytoskeleton for another purpose but then having gotten that they were in a position to use it to keep from blowing up if they got rid of their cell wall but they did have to get rid of their cell wall to become a eukaryote okay I by the way I definitely accept the fact that I don't know everything so I appreciate that now if you put your DNA into a nucleus and you no longer have it as a single circular chromosome then it is possible that without having to attach it to a cell wall it might make it easier to make multiple chromosomes and you get a big advantage from that in terms of how big a genome you can have because you can then start replication in parallel at multiple points rather than going around a single circular chromosome to do it and that means that there really would be no upper limit on genome size if you can make a hundred small chromosomes and start them all off at the same time and replication you'll get through the replication step very quickly so there is an issue about the origin of chromosomes that's actually a major transition in the sense of how is the genetic material organized on the one hand there's this replication advantage okay so you can make a lot you can make copies a lot faster if you do it in parallel in small pieces than in sequence and big pieces and so that would be a cost of having a bigger chromosome you might want to have a chromosome of intermediate size and if it's taking an interaction between two or more genes to produce either an organism or to produce a biochemical reaction system that has a certain ratio that is well balanced in terms of product then linking the genes that are involved in that ensures that they'll both be found in all the offspring and that's a benefit of making a bigger chromosome so there would be a tendency for the genome to a glutton 8 if this were the only thing going on but it's balanced by this cost this benefit is balanced by that cost and I'm sure there are other things as well I'm sure you can probably think of something now once you make chromosomes and you synchronize their replication then essentially what you've done is you have eliminated the competition of the genes because by putting the genes onto a chromosome you've put them all into the same boat you're no longer getting a situation where one gene might be replicating at a higher rate than another gene which would lead to unbalanced biochemistry and unbalanced development so you've given them a stake in the same process and that process is the replication of the chromosome on which they are sitting so particularly for the genes that were involved in replication if they needed to cooperate to replicate this would be an important consideration now if you've got a primordial cell that has a lot of reactions going on in it that are being controlled by genes that are all on separate chromosomes and if those chromosomes are not being divided evenly at mitosis and meiosis then it's possible that all those reaction systems are going to get out of balance okay and so if you've got unlinked genes with products need a certain ratio then getting them onto the same chromosome and regulating them all together gives you a big a big advantage over your competitors at that point I'm sorry this is running off I think it I think it shows up on your printout okay now the other thing that's going on in the eukaryotes is they've got these symbiotic organelles that were originally independent bacteria the mitochondria the chloroplasts and possibly the spindle apparatus so one thing that we notice when we look at the chloroplasts in the mitochondria is that the chloroplasts have a much bigger genome then do the mitochondria and the mitochondrial genes have been transferred into the nucleus we can sequence the mitochondria we know that they were independent purple bacteria and we can estimate from the size of the genome of a purple bacterium how much has now been transferred into the eukaryotic nucleus and we can see that a great deal has been transferred into the eukaryotic nucleus so one of the reasons to do that is essentially efficiency if you put those genes into the nucleus you're just maintaining two copies of them rather than thousands of copies out in the population of mitochondria that are living in the cell another is conflict resolution basically you're cutting way down on the opportunity for different variants to exist in mitochondrial processes if you're constructing all of the mitochondria out of essential elements that are in your nuclear genome you've gotten control over them in a way and you are making them all look the same rather than mutating and possibly having the option of creating a runaway mitochondrial cancer that would destroy your metabolism now why not put all the genes into the nuclear genome well there are a couple of reasons one is that the genetic code is actually different in the mitochondria and in eukaryotes and in the in the nuclear genome and in the chloroplast so the tRNA and ribosomal RNA genes the translation machinery had to be retained in the mitochondrion at least that much now that explains the mitochondrion but it doesn't explain the chloroplast it looks like the chloroplast retained more genes because it has to move macromolecules through more layers of membrane remember the world record on a chloroplast is that it has four membranes around it and all chloroplasts have two membranes around them so it's harder to move big molecules through them and so you need to if you need them to make the chloroplast function you have to make more of them locally so that's probably one reason for the retention of more genes in the chloroplast genome than in the mitochondrial genome do we think that the organelles were originally slaves of the things that ate them or was it in a relationship that might have been like a farmer and livestock the way that corals harvest dinoflagellates that are helping them make their carbonate skeletons well there's some evidence we can look at where are the tapping proteins made that are inserted into the organelle membranes and those are encoded in the nucleus okay and it looks like they evolved from host proteins so it looks like there have been manipulative steps where the host was actually tapping in to the symbiotic organelles that's one piece of evidence but there's also thought that they may have been mutualists and the excretory products of one of them which was a u bacterium it was making hydrogen and co2 and the missing piece of this sentence basically is that that would then have been food for the archein ancestor of the eukaryotic nucleus so they could have actually been mutualist so there is a slave hypothesis and there's a mutualistic hypothesis and that hasn't been settled why not just have one why do plants need to have two and if you look at their ancestors you can see that purple non sulfur bacteria cyanobacteria so those are the ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts they can do both they can both photosynthesize and they can respire however the purple bacteria can't photosynthesize when there's oxygen and the cyanobacteria used the same machinery for both functions and so that means that the host cell would not be able to separately control photosynthesis and respiration which one might want to uncouple and so it appears that mitochondria lost photosynthesis and chloroplasts lost respiration and coming into the cell so I'll I won't run through all of this you can read through it if you want basically what's going on here is the world record for membranes around the chloroplast is for it's in the dinoflagellate and what's going on here is that one thing eats a cyanobacterium and that makes a chloroplast that has the outer membrane of the cyanobacterium and the outer membrane of the cell that ate it wrapped around it so that makes two and then it happens two more times and so the world record for this is in a dinoflagellate okay and it turns out that the things that got eaten to make dinoflagellates had separated so that there were different kind of chloroplasts that got eaten by different things that both ended up making dinoflagellates and so it looks like in that sense dinoflagellates might be fought polyphyletic it's a it's a complicated sequence here and you will notice in here that you have got some interesting words roto fights photosynthetic stramenopiles have to fight the dinoflagellates themselves it would be worth doing a google image search on those things just to familiarize yourself with this bit of protists and biodiversity there are more things out there in the then our fantasies can imagine and these guys are specialists in all kinds of weird genetics so I just want to cue you to that we're not going to go this isn't a course in protest ology but there's been an awful lot of interesting evolutionary biology that's gone on in these single-celled creatures so that's the dinoflagellate they're cool things they have kind of a a bit like a small algal cell sitting inside of a complicated glass case so there are some other key events origin of the genetic code origin of multicellularity origin of germline and soma origin of social groups origin of language it's a big topic and in each one of these steps there are several very important things going on and there are certain similarities of the process and each one of those steps so I'd like to summarize those with a few principles that are involved so one of the things that's happening here is that there is a new level of selection there's a new level of replication the hierarchy is growing so you go from the hyper cycle into competing groups of proto cells and those eventually make a prokaryote and then there are symbiotic events and you actually then have selection operating on a eukaryotic cell that's got 2 or 3 genomes in it and then in the process the genetic material of course is also going through its reorganization into chromosomes then after that you get multicellularity you get cells that are probably genetically almost identical that are growing together you get division of labor within that so one of the things that happens is that the the babushka doll the number of levels in the hierarchy grows when that new upper level originates then there's an opportunity for functional specialization and division of labor in the in the multicellular organism we call this division of labor the origin of cell layers and organ systems so that some cells make brains and other cells make hearts I mean respiration some do excretion that would be a multicellular division of labor in a social insect colony we would say that the queen is specialized on reproduction and then we have the different castes that are doing things some of them are cleaning up the garbage in the colony some of them are feeding the queen some of them are foraging outside and you can see the analogy to a human society as well so there's functional specialization with division of labor there is a change in the system of information transmission so when you go from prokaryotes to eukaryotes you have to arrange for information to be transmitted not only in the nuclear genome but also in the cytoplasmic genomes and then you have the evolution of meiosis and you have sexual reproduction which is a huge change in the way information is transmitted probably since the origin of sex the biggest highest impact change in information transmission has been the origin of language and culture which gives a method of transmitting information from generation to generation that is independent of the DNA and allows the process to be going on in different directions in two levels then often in the process of forming this higher level of replication you have a bunch of lower-level units that are coming together to make a higher level unit and they need to cooperate to do that properly but they could be invaded by selfish mutants they could be destabilized and so there's a conflict issue and this conflict is sometimes stabilized by selection for cooperation you've heard me use several times in this lecture the a phrase like they're all in the same boat or they are all sharing mutual interests as in the genes getting together on a chromosome or the chemical reactions coming together in a single protocell those are all principles of conflict resolution because it you are in a tightly spatially organized system where your own welfare depends directly upon cooperation and with another thing in that system and your system is in competition with some outside system and the performance of your system is actually a direct function of how cooperative you are then there is strong selection for integration within that group and it's thought that this is the kind of thing that's going on when you have a key event and the origin of a new higher level in the evolutionary hierarchy so those are some of the key events in evolution they are a rather abstract way of looking at the history of life and next time we're going to look at major events in the geological theatre and so the lecture next time is more for people who like fireworks on the fourth of July and the clash of meteorites
