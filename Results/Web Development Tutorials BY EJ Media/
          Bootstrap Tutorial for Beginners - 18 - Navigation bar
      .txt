one of the most important features of any website is the navigation bar and bootstrap provides several classes to construct really really awesome navigation bars and you can do all sorts of things you can add buttons logos dropdowns and even search boxes so that's what we're going to cover over the next several videos so the first thing we're going to do is construct a basic navigation bar in bootstrap in this video so the first thing we want to do is create a div now for the first element you can either use a div or you can use the html5 nav element we're going to go ahead and use the html5 nav element now the first thing you need to call is the nav bar class that's one of the main classes and you guessed it that actually just tells bootstrap we're creating a navigation bar so let's go ahead and put that in and again it is nav bar now the next class we need to call is nav bar again now a lot of people have emailed me and asked me why do I have to specify all these classes in bootstrap why is there all this repetition well first of all bootstrap uses classes that's the main way you construct whatever it is you want to construct second of all they provide a great deal of customization so I mean I guess they could just provide one class but really what they want to do is provide a whole lot of different options so that's why this can seem very repetitive but again there is a method to their madness okay so let's go ahead and we're going to specify a nav bar again and here is where we can use an option and the first option we're going to use is the default option and this will just provide a default styling to our navigation bar and it will actually switch this a little bit later on but for now we're going to use the default option and let's go ahead and close out our nav now we need to specify another diff and another bootstrap class actually it is our first if not our second if so again we need to specify another class and the class we're going to specify here is container - fluid and basically what this tells bootstrap to do is to expand the navbar all the way across the browser so basically this will give us a responsive navbar whatever size the browser window is that it will expand out to the size of the browser window so this is an important one okay now we need to go ahead and start adding our menu items and in this video we're going to add buttons and of course that means we need a UL element along with Li element so let's go ahead and create our UL element and now we need to call yet another bootstrap class and that class is the nab class this is the bootstrap class that you'll always call inside your UL element so now and then we need to call the navbar class again and the option that we're going to use here is map that's all we need so this is the basic structure that you need right here you need to first create the navbar then you create the container which in this case is going to be a fluid container and then you need the UL element and these to bootstrap classes and now we're ready to go ahead and add our buttons first let's go ahead and actually close this out and there we go now as I said we're ready to add our buttons and what do we use for that we use the li element of course so let's go ahead and create our first button and we're actually going to call another bootstrap class and I'll explain what this does in a second and that class is active and basically what this does is it highlights the button that is active and in this case we're going to set this to the home button and we only will actually use this with our first button because we only want one button active at a time and then of course we need our anchor link and we're just going to put a pound sign in here for now but you can put whatever link you wish to put in here and as I said this is going to be our home button and then we just need to close out of course the anchor link and of course now we need to close out the li element and there we go we've got our very first button now let's just go ahead and put in a few more buttons here and let's go ahead and just copy and paste this now as I said we don't want both of these buttons active at the same time so we're going to get rid of the bootstrap class for the second one this is just going to be a regular li element and let's say we need a news section so let's go ahead and put that here and let's go ahead and copy and paste this again and we'll call this lifestyle how about that and let's create one more button and we'll call this one entertainment how about that okay good I think we're all ready to go here let's go ahead and save this and then let's launch this in Chrome and let's see what we get here there you can see look at that it worked and take a look at that the home button is active as you can see it's highlighted now we can also change the overall color of this and there are many different styles that bootstrap will provide so let's go back here and as I said this is just sort of the default look and you'll remember that's what we specified let's go back to our HTML though and let's go ahead and flip this to inverse and you will see what this does in a second so let's go ahead and launch this in chrome and take a look at that now our navigation bar is black so some people like this style instead but as I said there are different styles that you can pick and choose and we'll cover those in the upcoming videos okay that's going to do it for this video we will continue on with the navigation bar in the next video thank you
