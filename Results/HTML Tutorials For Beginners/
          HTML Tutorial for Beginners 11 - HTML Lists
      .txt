ah yo people I'm Sean from the nettinger and this is HTML basics lesson 11 HTML lists so there's a few different types of Lists in HTML and we're just gonna have a quick talk about them first before we dive into the code so let's go over those and the first type is an unordered list and this is a list or grouping of items that you've got on your web page that doesn't necessarily have some kind of order to it the second one is an ordered list and this is for kind of Lists with some kind of structure to them there's an order to them a definite order so for example how to catch a fish five logical steps and a definition list is the final one and this is a bit different we'd use this for something like a dictionary of terms so where we have a definition and then a description to that word and we use this DL tag for this and that stands for definition list and then we use a DT tag for the term that's done for definition term and then we use a DD tag for the description that stands for definition description so we're going to dive back into the code now we're gonna have a quick look at using each one of these right so I'm back here in the index page and we're going to look at the UL list first of all now like I said before ul doesn't have any order to it or it doesn't have to have any order to it so it's just a grouping of items on a page that you want to put together in a list just to kind of contain them within some kind of logical grouping so a lot of websites use ul tags for navigations because they're a grouping of links and we're going to do that here as well so I'm going to come just above where we've got our links here and I'm going to pop the UL tag at the top I'm going to take the closing tag and pop it right at the bottom over here and then what I'm going to do is just get all these highlight them all I'm going to click the tab key and that's going to move them on so they're indented so we can see the contents of our list and then each item within this list is going to be a link so we're going to surround each link item with an Li all right so so I've enclosed each a tag with an li tag so each of these items now is within an li tag within the UL tag so I'm going to save this off and I'm going to have a look in the browser what this looks like show an explorer index and you can see here now the browser has looked at the code and it said okay well these are list items and I'm going to kind of format these in a list in the webpage now you can use CSS later on and you can kind of rearrange this list so they can be side-by-side you can remove these little bullet points here you'll have squares or nothing at all and you can style them exactly how you like this is just the default styles which I talked about in a previous tutorial so there's our ul now we're going to look at an ordered list next so to demonstrate the ordered list I want to jump over to this how-to page of made here and I've just done this by right-clicking here and got a new file and and I've copied the head and the opening body and closing body tag from the front page the index and I've just got this h1 in here how to catch a smelly fish I'm not going to pretend to know how to do this so I'm just going to put some gummy text in here I'm just kind of demonstrating how we'd create an ordered list and to do that with using Oh L stands for ordered list remember and we're going to jump in between here and we'll do Li and then we'll say step 1 jump down and I again step 2 and finally step 3 okay so there are three steps to catch a fish and I don't know how to do that so I'm going to leave it just like this rather make a fool of myself and so I'm going to save this and preview this in a browser and you can see this time where is the unordered list just gave us blank bullets because there was no particular order to that list this is giving us logical numbers and so one two and three and we could even have kind of sub-lists beneath each step so if you wanted to point one for example you could kind of do that and have some sub lists on here in fact I'll show you quickly how to do that so I'm going to jump under the step two and within the Li tags I'm going to just do a line break there indent and I'm going to do another or well tag like that and I'm going to do an li tag between that so what we've done here is nested and ordered list within another audit list and I'm going to pop step two point one and I'll do this copy and paste this do it one more time step two point two save that out and then preview in a browser and we can see now it's indented because the browser is saying okay well we've got list nested within another list and I'm going to show that to the user so I'm going to indent it along okay so that's an ordered list and finally we want to look at a definition list so a definition list is a little bit different we don't just have our allies for each item philippi for each list item we have a DT for a definition term and we have a DD for a definition description so I've created this blank page here called lists and we'll just create a definition list here with you the Yong tag and then we're going to put our DT tag first because we're going to give our term our definition term and we're going to say unordered list and then below this we're going to do a TD tag which stands for definition description so we're going to give a description of the term and an unordered list is a list without any consideration to order so it's just a grouping of items in a logical manner we're going to do our second term our second DT tag I'm going to say a ordered list and for this we'll give a definition of this is a list in which order is important okay and then finally we're going to put our DT and have this one be the definition list and our DD tag the definition for the description and a definition list contains terms and descriptions much like the dictionary okay so that's what a DL list looks like we've got our opening and closing DL tags then we've got our DT tags for the term and then we've got our DD tags for the description of that term so I'm going to save this and view it in a browser and there we go we can see we've got a definition here and then indented below it we've got our description so that pretty much covers everything to do with lists if you have any
