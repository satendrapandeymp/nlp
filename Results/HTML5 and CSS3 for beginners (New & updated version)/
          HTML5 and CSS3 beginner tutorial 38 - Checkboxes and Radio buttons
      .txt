hey you do b'hala going is Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 38 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit more about forms and we're actually going to continue with the form that we worked with in the previous video so hopefully you guys watch the previous video and then you'll be up to date if you didn't watch the previous video maybe we go back and watch it but yeah basically what I did was I had this form over here that had place for a name a password and a submit button and if you take a look at that in the code we basically have an input of type text for a name and input of type password for the password which obviously allows you to have bulleted bullet points instead of having actual characters show up and that's just obviously for security purposes and now we can see what parts were you're typing in here and then the last one is that input of type submit' which made the submit button right so that's the the code that we're working with and also you'll notice that I have an action in my form of login dot PHP and that just means that whenever we click the submit button we get taken through to that file and that happens to be this file over here which actually does nothing it basically just tells us that the data has been submitted so I will take care of data manipulation and data validation when we actually learn about PHP and JavaScript and stuff like that but for now because we're only now learning HTML we're not going to worry too much about that right so now that we've got all that ketchup stuff out of the way let's move on to checkboxes and radio buttons and labels I think I saw anyone talk about in this video so the first thing I want to do is add a checkbox to my websites I'm going to do that by typing in inputs and then under type we're going to add in check box and that's going to create a check box on our webpage then we're also going to have to give this a name I'm just going to say sign up and like I said in the previous tutorials these names are not really going to mean anything to us right now because basically yeah that it only gets used for when you are processing data with PHP or with JavaScript or something so right now the name doesn't really mean all that much to us but we should definitely get into a habit of giving each one of our check boxes or input elements or whatever a name so let's save this now and take a look at this in the browser so let's go back to just the index file and you can see that okay yeah there we go now we have a our name and our password but we also have a checkbox that I can tick a none tick right although that doesn't really mean anything to me as a user because I don't know what I'm checking this checkbox for so we're probably going to need to add in a label just to let people know what this checkbox is supposed to do so the reason why I named the signup is because now we can add a little label over here whoopsie a little label over here so go ahead and type in label and that's going to add in this tag and I'm just going to drop down to a new line to make it look a little bit more tidy and then I'm going to grab some of these line breaks over here and just paste those down there as well and all that's going to do is obviously just make everything appear on a new line and then for this label let's add in sign me up for the news letter or something like that right just an example of where using a label would be useful all right so it saves us now refresh and there we go we now have a label next our checkbox so I can at least see why the hell I'm checking this thing and yeah now that we know why we're checking it I just want to show you another really cool trick that you can do with this label so basically if you go to your input element or this checkbox element and give it an ID so type in ID is equal to and then I'm just going to use the same ID as the name it just makes a lot of sense for me to do this and you'll probably see why in just a second and then basically on this label go ahead and add another attribute calls for and then set that equal to something and basically what you want to set it equal to is the exact same thing as the ID if for some reason whatever you typed in this for attribute and this ID are different than this thing that I'm about to show you is not going to work but let's save this jump back over to the browser and refresh and now you'll notice that when I click on my label the check box gets ticked and when I click on the label again the check box gets an ticked so it just gives you like more space to click on something right so instead of like forcing the user to have to check on the check box they can check on the label and that's especially useful when there's like maybe three or four check boxes when you click on the label then you know exactly which check box is is matching up to that label basically right so now that we have that one sorted let me show you guys another attribute which is an attribute called checked and basically this is really useful for check boxes and the next thing that we're going to take a look at which is radio buttons because it then automatically checks a box for the user so if we save this and jump back over to the browser and refresh you can see that right now this box is ticked and it's because I've set this attribute to checked is equal to checked if I take that out and save this and then refresh in the browser you can see that when the user visits the page for the first time that checkbox is not going to be checked but with the attribute if you save it that checkbox is automatically ticked all right now let's go ahead and just take a look at what happens if we have multiple checkboxes so right now we only have the one but let's say I added in another two so let's paste in two more checkboxes and I'm just going to give the label something different over here so let's just say sign up for special offers and sign up for a premium membership or something like that right just all cases of where you might want to use a checkbox in a form and then underneath the names you might want to use different well actually for the purpose of this tutorial I just want to I'm going to use the exact same name for three of these but basically in future you might want to use different names but yeah again for the purpose of this tutorial I want to use the exact same name because I want to show you guys something and then okay for the IDS let's go ahead and just change all of those because you can't have three elements with the same ID in HTML it's just very very wrong so you should never do that so let's just change these IDs and because we're changing the IDS we also need to change the four attributes on all of the labels so we've got signup one sign up two and sign up three and basically we just need to take that and move it across as well so sign up one sign up to and sign up three save that and jump back over to the browser and that basically just makes it so that when you click on the label the right box will be checked or unchecked if you didn't change any of these IDs or these four attributes probably going to land up with a little bit of a problem when it comes to checking the boxes right okay so now we have those three checkboxes checked and this is something I wanted to show you guys right is if you have three check boxes and they all have the exact same name all of the check boxes can be checked which is awesome for when you have multiple options for a check box or if you want basically the user to be able to check all of these options so in this case yes the user can sign up for all three packages right but let's say for instance the user needed to specify a gender or basically just you need it you needed the user to specify something but they could only select one option they couldn't select all three right then that's where something called a radio button comes in handy so let's copy all of well actually let's not copy all of those let's just type it all up again alright so I'm going to create another input element over here and I'm going to give this a type of radio so instead of checkbox we're using a radio button and for the name I'm going to set this equal to gender and basically the reason why we're doing this is because when a user maybe signs up for your website you want to know what gender they are and usually this is going to be male or female and in some cases you can add an other box to accommodate certain people right but there aren't going to be too many people who are more than one gender they aren't going to be people who are male and female or another you're right so you only want them to be able to pick male or female alright so we've got the first box over here and I'm going to give this a ID of male and maybe a value of male and again value is maybe not going to come in much use right now to us just knowing HTML but if you know PHP then it's definitely going to come in handy when you want to get the value of whichever box to use the ticked right and in fact we probably don't need that but I'm just placing it there anyways just to show you guys that there is an attribute over here that we can use which is called value and then I'm going to go ahead and just copy a label over here and paste that label above the radio button and then the for attribute needs to be whatever the ID was so this ID is male and then for the text in the label let's go ahead and add male right so now we have a box for a male we just can't well now we just just going to copy that and paste it below here and then we'll say female and then for let's just change that to female and then the ID littlez we'll change that to female and the value to female alright so just make sure that you update all of those things it's going to be really confusing for you if you don't but I know that there's a lot of different places to change them so just make sure for the label the ID and the value all match up and they're all exactly the same thing okay let's go ahead and copy this and paste this down here and then add one more gender which is just going to be other and we're just adding that to accommodate somebody who believes that they're either not one of the other two genders right so let's go other other other and other right save this and come back over to the browser refresh and now we have these radio buttons it's probably going to be a little bit better if we add break tags after each radio button and save this now alright and the reason why I did that was obviously just to make it look nicer all right but you'll notice that with checkboxes if you check mail then you can only have mail checked so you can't go ahead and then check other because of the second you do that male gets unchecked and it's the same thing with female the second you check female then one of the other in this group is going to get untaxed and the way that the browser knows that these three things are all a group is by looking at the name so make sure that the name for each one of these checks boxes is the same so if I've named them all gender so this one's name is gender this one's name is Jen and this one is gender if for some reason you change the name and you made the name different basically it's going to mean that the user can check more than one of these radio buttons and we don't want that to happen because that's obviously why a radio button is useful for when a user only can check one of these buttons right so now we've gone ahead and taken a look at what radio buttons are we've also looked at what input or checkboxes are and now we know the difference between both of them by the way you can also add in a value on that checkbox as well I know I didn't talk about that but yeah basically you can also add a value here it's just really not going to come in a much use to us right now until we know some sort of scripting language like PHP and yeah now that I've explained all that stuff and you also know how to use labels I'm going to end the video off right here I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to
