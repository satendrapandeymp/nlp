what's going on guys welcome to your 1980 ml5 tutorial and this is actually my first tutorial since I moved to New York for those of you guys who were watching before you knew that I used to live in North Carolina and then I moved up to New York a couple weeks ago actually I think like a week ago today in fact and so yeah the move went well I did get in car crash or anything so I'm ready to start making some tutorials again so let's jump right into this in this tutorial I'm just going to talk about all the leftover stuff that I kind of left out when I was talking about the flexible box model so after this story you're going to know everything about laying out the flexible box model so let's see where we picked off because I know it's been a while okay so obviously by this little website we've been talking about the WebKit box flex property which means say you had three boxes of a fixed width and you had one that was box flex one it would just say okay take up all of the available extra space so what it would do is it would add all these and see how much space it had left over in the parent and it would just give this that much space so actually this o is zero property this with property you don't even need it anymore and actually what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be deleting the width property for all of these and I'm going to be giving all of them a box flex property of one so delete this paste that in its place delete this width paste in this place and the reason we don't need the width anymore is because it's automatically if I show you guys actually it's automatically going to figure out the width of the parent and then figure out how it can evenly flex all of these to give them all the same share of the pie so I know this parent is like 700 pixels wide but say this parent was a thousand pixels wide what it would do is it say okay I have four kids in since they all have the same box flex value of one I'm going to flex them all 250 pixels and yes I know that we have margin and padding's as well but I'm just giving you guys an easy example so here is what you know already you know that there's a box flex property of zero whenever you're working with fixed width you also know one to make it flexible but did you know that you can have a box flex value of anything greater than one for example two three five whatever you want you're saying okay that kind of just blows my mind because I know that excuse me and got a hairball in my throat I know that zero makes it unflexible and one makes it flexible so what the heck what to do well let me go ahead and give you guys example let's go ahead and pick on kid number two take number two so if we go ahead and save this we can see that okay kid number two kind of grew a little bit so what's going on is this you know how I told you guys if the parent was a thousand pixels wide and you had each of these with the property of one then it pretty much says a thousand divided by four since you have four kids equals 250 now I didn't explain that to you guys because I didn't think you guys could do math I explained it because of this whenever you have four kids with the even box value it divides it evenly however since kid number two now takes up two spaces what it's going to do is this think of it like this this number right here says how many spaces do you want to take up so this one takes this one this one takes up two this one takes up one and this one takes up one so now if you add them together one two three four five so now it's going to say a thousand divided by five each space has 100 pixels so this one takes up excuse me 200 200 400 200 or you can think of it like this is it's easier whenever you have a box fixed value of 1 and to the one where the box x value of 2 is going to take up twice the width of 1 and 3 will take up 3 times the width is 1 that may be easier explanation so let me go ahead and change this back to 1 and now what I want to do is I want to show you guys one last example and this is the last thing I want to talk to you guys about concerning the flexible box property so say okay we need to change or give mommy height so say we have a height of like 300 pixels high equals 300 pixels so mommy is 300 pixels tall for some reason that's how tall we want our website and now we say each kid has a height of I don't know 100 pixels so let me just go ahead and change this right here so go ahead and give each kid on 100 pixels and this one too and of course this one too right there and what we're going to do is go ahead and save this refresh it and take a look at it so now we're laying on our website okay that's how tall we want it looks pretty good yeah this is how tall we want the kids but I don't know like maybe we have an article in a picture here and an adder right here or something stupid say okay this website is looking pretty good but I wish these could just move down a little bit in the center because they look kind of weird when they jammed up against the top there well what we can do is we can add a vertical alignment in the web or excuse me in the flexible box model and it's not vertical align like before you add this property whenever you want to vertically align the crap inside your box its WebKit and this is going to change whenever a browser start adopting this but for now when you're using Chrome it's a WebKit box - a line and it has a bunch of values for now I'm just going to show you guys Center real quick whenever you Center this think of this right here is saying vertical align property vertically align everything in my box hmm that's kind of a yeah anyways so anyways just go ahead and center that and as you can see since we added that Center aligned property it's Center aligned vertically up and down everything inside the parent box so as you can see now all of these kids are in the center vertically again I'm not talking about horizontally vertically can't stress that enough and actually it isn't top center bottom it has a bunch of all let me think of the values star and Center baseline and stretch in by the way everything by default is stretch so if you don't mess with it at all um what it's going to do is in if you don't get a fixed height like this what it's going to do is it's going to go ahead and let me go ahead and delete these heights the reason it's not stretching is because they gave it a fixed height but if I get rid of that by default in the Flex box model everything is set the stretch so now I should refresh this and if I don't look like a full everything is stretched out perfectly so that's the default value but again star is like the top and the end is the bottom you'll figure it out so anyways that's all the time I have for this tutorial in the next tutorial we're going to get away from the flexible box model because I'm sure your brains are as packed full is a much flex box model info as you can handle so anyways thank you guys for watching and oh forget subscribing now see you guys in the next tutorial
