welcome to the sixth video on beginning CSS we are going to use the code from the last video that we did and continue on now in previous videos a lot of the CSS rules that we set up were generic rules so that is when we set the rule up it would apply to every element on our webpage and what I mean by that if we take a look here at the paragraph rule we set up this would apply towards all of the paragraph elements that we had in our HTML document so you can see here everything is read as it should be the rule was applied to every P element that it found so even though these are separate elements P elements it applied it to every one of these elements because we told it to do that now you might ask the question how do I select these paragraphs individually and that is where classes come into play and so let's say now we want this paragraph right here to be blue and we want this paragraph right here to be green and so we have to use classes as I said and so we're going to come down here into the element and we're first going to add our class name here so you add the class to the element first and then you create the rule up here so first we'll create the class and you say class equals so that's an attribute that's the attribute and you type in equals and then it'll be double quote and you put in the name of the class you want and it can be anything but you should make this something relevant so it'll call this blue because this is going to be blue text and then we'll close it okay and then let's go down here and actually let's not leave a space there and then we'll go down here and we'll go ahead and copy and paste this and we'll make this green text right here so now we've got our two classes and so we're going to come up here and now we can go ahead and select our classes and let's go ahead and do that and so we put a dot here now the dot is used to specify the class that we defined down here and in this case we're going to call this blue and we'll go ahead and change this to blue and now let's just copy and paste this rule and we will now create one for our green text that we want and now we've selected the P element with the green class okay so we're all set so now let's go back up here and I just wanted to point out pretty much everything else is the same if you take a look I mean it's the same brackets that we have here same type of rules everything else is the same is just this dot here that we specify a class now so we're using a selector and we're selecting the class with the dot and so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and close this out we don't need this anymore and let's reopen this and there you see we've got our blue text and we've got our green text you know what we probably should have made this purple or something because we had our if you remember in the last video we had our h1 and h2 tags green so let's go ahead and switch that really quick to purple and we'll change the class name to make it more relevant and we'll come up here and call this purple we'll save this and there you see we've got our purple text from our purple class and now we've got our blue text from our blue class that we created Oh before we go I wanted to point out one more thing you'll notice that we put the class attribute in the first tag so the it's not in the closing tag it always goes in the first element tag here and so that's just the way that works and it goes inside the angle brackets for the first element tag as you can see here so it's always inside the angle brackets of the first element tag and so that's how classes work and I'm going to do another video on this there's some more nuances to this and we'll cover that in the next video see you guys that
