hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss CSS selectors and how they are useful CSS selectors are used to select an HTML element or more than one HTML element and apply styles on them there are three different styles selectors we have that we use most commonly they are tag selector ID selector and class selectors let's have a demo I go to start and then I say here notepad I click on notepad then I say HTML opening tag closing HTML tag then I write opening head tag and a closing head tag opening body tag and a closing body tag in between head section I am going to write opening title tag and then I say CSS selectors demo closing title tag I go to file save as I save the file with the name CSS SEL ECT urs selectors demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and save it and desktop I right click on CSS selectors demo dot HTML open with the Firefox you can see that the file got open and title is set to CSS selectors demo in the body section I am going to put some div elements I am going to write opening div and closing div and then I am going to copy this div and paste it five times one two three four five so total six div elements we have if we want to apply styles on these developments of course we have to use a style tag so here I am writing opening style tag and then I write a closing style tag we know that style tag must and should be written in the head section it has an attribute called as type there we put the value text or CSS to indicate that whatever we write in between these style tags is going to be a normal text or CSS we know that div tags are block level tags they always put the content on new fresh line and they take the entire available width of the browser window now here I want to apply some styles on these developments like I want to apply BAC kg gry you and a background - color pink I want to apply the width of each to be 100 pixel and height of each div should be 100 pixels that was my intention now I have listed here few style rules that I want to apply on these div tags now how do I tell to the system that I want to apply these styles to these div tags by using tag selector we are going to write the tag name so here I write a div then we use flower brackets to group more than one styles here you can see that I am telling to the browser that locate every div element so this is a tag selector method so I am writing the tag name you can see that I am telling to the browser locate every div element apply the background color pink on it width of 100 pixel height of 100 pixel if I say file save good browser and refresh you can see that there are many deep Scott created we don't find any space in between so what I do is I say margin ma are GI n margin of 5 pixel then what happens is we find a margin around a div elements you can see we have 5 pixels margin applied and we can see the space this is an example for tag selector guys so I indent a little bit okay now we understood what is tag selector I hope you guys have understood if you have many paragraphs and all you want to apply Styles you just need to write the tag name and whatever the Styles you want to apply on those paragraphs or any HTML element group them in Flour brackets that's it quite simple we might come across a situation where we want to uniquely identify an HTML element and apply style on it for example I want to apply a background color of red to this specific development how do I do that now is there a way for that yes we have a way called as ID selector we are going to use ID selector to identify uniquely an element and apply style on it for example to use ID selectors we have to use ID attribute so here I'm going to use ID attribute and then we have to give a value I am going to say here do one you can see I have given a ID attribute to this do one to uniquely identify this div element from other developments now how do we apply a specific style on this div now what we can do is we can use ID selector instead of writing the tag name this time we have tried ID name d1 but before that we have to prefix hash sign hash symbol indicates that you are referring to an ID called do one now in brackets I am going to put here BAC k gr whoo und background - color of red semicolon now what we are telling to the system is locate any tag which has an ID attribute with a value do 1 and apply the background color red if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that this div is set with a background color and red and also you can see that it is having the width 100 pixel height 100 pixel margin also 5 pixel set the reason is only this div has done the operation lot of operation for us it has already created a width height margin it has set to this div and it has previously set the pink color but we have overwritten here down we want the background color to be red to this specificity one hope you guys are understanding similarly I want to apply some other color to this div I want to uniquely identify this div in CSS and apply some other color for example I can say here ID and I can give a value maybe I can give d1 but it is recommended that every ID attribute value should be unique that means this is a problem what I do means I am going to write here - so these two are different values you can see now I can easily and uniquely identify these div elements file save this time what I do here I say div - should have the background color BAC k gr o UND background - color may be blue but i should write here hash sign hash must and should be written file save go to browser and refresh you can see that this div is now having the background color set to blue you can even specifically tell like locate a div element which has an ID div - you can prefix the tag name also like I am telling here locate a div element which has an ID of d1 if I say file slave go to browser refresh this also works perfectly there is no problem this is you are telling specifically okay now next thing is there are there might be one more situation you get for example you want to apply these two div elements should have a background color of green or maybe these three should have a background color of green now how do you apply you can use the ID tag there is no problem in that you can say ID and you can uniquely say div 3 this is going to be ID and you can say div for and this is going to have an ID of 5 you can see now I can access these independently in CSS and apply the style for example I can copy this and paste it down and say locate a div which has an ID d3 and apply the background color green on it if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh this got green color similarly I can copy that and paste it down and say locate a div element which has an ID of do four and apply the background color green file save go to browser and refresh you can see that similarly I can say one more time copy that and paste it down and say do five should have green color background file save go to browser refresh this is also having a green color but you can see that we are repeatedly writing the same code again and again why can't we group these three div elements in one group and apply the styles on all of them at a time here comes the use of class selector to take help of class selectors we are going to write instead of ID attribute we write class attribute so here I am going to write CL a SS class here also I am going to write class it is not necessary that if you have to give unique we can use a same name for all these divs here what I do is I can say here green div class name or class values can be same there is no problem if you have same values now what happens all these divs are grouped in a class with the name green div so here what I do instead of writing all these I'm going to delete this and simply I say dot dot indicates class ok and I say here gr EE and green div opening bracket closing bracket so green div is a name or value of a class attribute so we are telling locate every green div class and apply the background color background color here I am going to say now in this place maybe I say yellow semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that all these divs are set to yellow background color because all these divs have a class attribute with a value green doom you can still specifically say by writing the div prefixing by the tag name so you are telling here to the browser that locate a div which has a class name or class value Green div and set the background color to yellow and if I want I can set here green also no problem file save good browser and refresh now you can see that all these are having the green color remember that tag selectors you can use to set the default styles you can use ID selector to uniquely identify an HTML element and apply style on them you can use the class attribute to group set of HTML elements and apply styles on them and remember that when you are accessing the ID attribute or a class attribute in CSS ID attribute must time should be prefixed by the hash sign you can see and a class attribute value must and should be prefixed by the dot dot indicates the class ok hope you guys have understood how to use a tag selector how to use ID selector how use a class selector and how they are helpful in different situations so for this tutorial this much is enough friends I suggest you to try with some other examples try using paragraphs try using some other tags and apply different styles on them for this tutorial this much as you know friends in the next tutorial will get more information on HTML and CSS for more benefits please subscribe and don't forget to like comment and share these videos keep learning keep coding keep sharing see you in the next tutorial guys thank you very much
