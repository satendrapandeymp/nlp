welcome to the 24th video on beginning CSS in this video we're going to examine the border property and so let's open up our CSS style sheet and let's work against paragraph for the CSS code in paragraph four and that of course is right here now of course we've already talked about the border color the border width and the border style properties but we're going to examine these a little bit more in depth but first let's take a look at the border color property now of course we know that in CSS there are three ways to specify color one way is to use the name and we're doing that right here we're specifying black the other is to use the RGB value and the other is to use the hex code so let's go ahead and put in the hex code and we'll just come over here and paste this let's save this let's open up our web page and there you can see we've got a nice green dark green actually border so let's close that out now in terms of the border width you can use three keywords here you can use thin medium or thick or you can just give the pixel size and we've been doing that we gave this two pixels but let's go ahead and use one of these border width keywords so let's make this thick and let's go ahead and save this and let's open up our web page and as you can see now we have this nice thick border around our paragraph element so let's close this out now the third property of course is the style property and this is where things can get pretty interesting now we've been using solid of course throughout the series but let's let's take a look at some of these others let's try let's try dashed let's take a look at this one so we'll save this and there you can see we have a dashed border ah let's take a look at double let's try that and you can try some of these yourself as well so let's go ahead and put in double we'll save it again and there you can see we have a nice double border now now these bottom four right here have a 3d effect and so these can really make your border very dynamic so let's try let's try Ridge and if we take a look and you can see there's a little bit of a 3d effect here now and actually that looks really good in my opinion and so let's go ahead and use that for our border on our paragraph for element and we'll just keep that okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
