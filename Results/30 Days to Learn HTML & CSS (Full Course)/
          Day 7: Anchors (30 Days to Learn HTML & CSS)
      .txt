today we're going to learn about anchor tags and this allows us to connect one page to another and this can be a local page or we can even link to a different website so let's take a look I'm going to add a paragraph tag and I would like to say visit me at my site I would like to make my website a link to my personal website so we do that by wrapping it within an anchor tag we do that it has an element name of a we can do it like this so let's wrap it but then this alone will not work let's see though what happens when we view it in the browser as you can see here even though my website is wrapped within an anchor element it's not even receiving any styling so we need to add a specific attribute that specifies what we are linking to that is vital and it's required for all anchor tags for obvious reasons so we do that by speccing h r e F some people will say whore F you'll also hear people say href either will do now we need to say what are we referring to what are we reference Inc to my personal website in this case now I will save it again and let's view it one more time and now you'll see that the browser has provided some default styling for anchor tags we can see here that it makes the text blue or purplish for visited websites and it also makes the text underlined to help specify that it is a link but remember you can override every single one of these things so now let's click on it and see where we go now it's taken me to my personal website good but notice we've lost our current page and that's fine and it is considered a best practice don't always open up new windows that said though you should know how to do it because sometimes it does make sense to do so so if we want to specify that this link should open within a new tab I can add another attribute name and you'll notice that some editors will provide some hints in this case we're going to specify target what is the target of this link I'm going say open it in a blank notice then underscore blank tab so let's save it and I'm going to reload the page and this time when I click it notice that it creates a new tab that links to my website you'll probably want to keep it like this unless you have a specific reason where you need the person to stay on your website but don't be greedy and and do that by default because it tends to irritate people now what if we want to link to a local page so right now I have one page that I'm storing on my desktop and you can see it's right here so I will add a new file this one's going to be called how about about and this will be our about page now I'm going to copy everything here and we'll say my about page and now on this page we want to be able to link to a page that describes who we are so let's give it some quick info first the heading 1 what's most important on this page about me that way they know exactly what they're getting if all they read was this h1 tag and then we'll say that looks good to me so now I'm going to link to this page and I will say right here learn more about me and now we're going to take about me or we could take the entire string why don't we do that and we're going to wrap it once again we're using an anchor element and we're going to specify an attribute name of her F or href and an attribute of value and this time because it's in the exact same directory in my case the desktop directory I can simply reference it like so about HTML come back and I will reload the page and now notice because I have never visited this site before it's not showing that purplish color it's showing blue so I'm going to click on it and now we are on the about Me section so this is the basic concept between if you were building a static web site now a static web site is simply a website that is not using a database it's not determining content dynamically it's static meaning every bit is coded in simple markup and we're not using any kind of server-side language because you're not ready for that just yet but now we have about me but how do we get back to our homepage well this is why you would normally have a navigation section that would be present on every page but for now let's simply add one more link back to the home page and we'll call this back to home and once again reference it with an anchor tag linking to index.html now one more time I load the page and now I can return home and I can go back and forth and notice this time because these pages have been visited the browser has specific styling that says if this anchor tag has been visited meaning if it's in your browser history then you're going to style it this way so the user has a quick little note to note I have been here before now coming back to local references this works because both of these files are stored within the root folder so why don't we do this I'm going to create a new folder because you will find with all of your projects they will be contained within a root folder so I'm going to say learning I'm going to take each of these and drag them in like so next I'm going to create an additional directory and maybe this will be the about folder because this is going to contain everything related to the about me page so I will drag that and bring it in like so and now let's see what happens with this alone so first I need to update my project so I'm going to close each of these out and now I'm going to drag this new learning folder back into my editor and now you can see we can reference the folder so let's see what has changed now let's come back and now we are referencing desktop learning index.html so let's see if this link works if I click it nope that didn't work because we are trying to reference or we are trying to find an about that HTML file that's within the root and it's not in the root anymore it's within an about folder so we reference about folders by using the name of the folder followed by a forward slash in this case we would do about because that's name of this folder right here and then followed by a forward slash like so now let's try it refresh click on it and now we are correctly referencing it so always make sure that you reference the folder names and you're not always assuming that every file will be within the same directory but we also must remember the same is true for linking out of directories this link will not work as well because now we're trying to link to end XHTML within the about directory but of course that's not contained within there so to go up a directory meaning from the about go up to the next parent directory and then look for a file called index.html we do period period forward slash if you're familiar with the terminal or the command line at all this will look very familiar to you so now we're saying go up to the parent directory and then look for whoops I am in the wrong file let's do it one more time go up to the parent directory and then look for index.html let's try it again refresh and there we are so now we are learning how to connect files that are in different folders just take a look at one last thing before we finish up today notice how we are referencing in about folder but then we duplicate that again so we have about about now what you'll find is when you name a file index dot HTML as we've done right here that becomes the default file to display for a folder so for example if we come back to our root learning directory and I don't type in anything it will still render the index.html file click it and in this case it's not because we are on our local system but by default it should do that if you have it on a website this is identical to this that in mind if we have an about folder we should be able to link automatically to the end XHTML file we should be able to change about that HTML to index because these are not within the same folder you can have multiple files with the same name so I will do that right now rename it to index now if we load the page this will load instantly once you upload it to your web host so that is the essentials of what you need to know about using anchor text it's really not that difficult is it in the next lesson you're going to get to have some fun because we are finally going to learn the very very basics of working with cascading style sheets or CSS
