hi guys welcome to nourish a technologies this is Brazil in this video session will observe HTML forms these are popularly known as web performs almost all in HTML for version most important session in a very web page there are the form controls available form related controls available these controls also classified into different types before entering into those controls what is a form form is a container which can able to hold some more other controls it is a popularly known as web before I made already definition clearly if the form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing so that is form exactly it is taking from the user and it is submitting to server not from taking with the help of of course HTTP now a form will take input from the viewer as very select or input whatever it data is entering is taking that from client to server forms are used to create user interactive web applications so it is comes under dynamic hypertext markup language concept not fully I'm talking about the partially actually real dhtml is nothing but HTML plus cascading style sheets place JavaScript equal to original dynamic hypertext markup language but whereas in forms action attribute available it is behaving like the HTML because it is moving from one static page to another page that is a dynamic it is showing so based on that we are calling interactive but not pure interactive form is a paid opening available as usual closing available firm has a different attributes name method action target encrypted type so name Java suite purpose we are providing a renamed action we can specify the page which server you need to submit dot aspx dot JSP dot PHP any kind of CGA related target generally you want to display the output of the same page or the new page new tab we are going to specify based on values and keep the type and crypto type generally we are using for them post attribute it has a different values also to encode that and two types of possible values we are using application level as well as another one is a multi form data level so these also practical I will show you it is a best concept in html5 environment also encrypted type but these form texts are classified different types but basically these are the form tags tag description from input button text area label field set legend like the different different controls available based on these controls practically one by one we can see and form fields are basically classified into two types simple input fields select fields input fields again now I wrote a big list about that these are the field name keyword syntax what are the field names are available what is a keyword and the related syntax syntax is the most important here so every keyboard every syntax based I will develop some login pages some registration forms in couple of minutes so again these fields supports a different kind of attributes what are the attributes basically available here so these many big list of attributes waiting for us to implement practically forms attribute name any name we can apply value any value can apply name only JS purpose value visibility purpose size a textbox size max'll and how many characters rows the columns the visibility for only text area readable two are false by default false disabled is equal disabled we are using to disable a form control check it is equal to check we are using generally check retribute for them radio buttons as well as checkboxes and finally multiple so when you are going to convert a combo box into list box we are using multiple is equal to multiple or multiple usable true or multiple is equal to false so now based on these attributes one by one examples we can observe so let will start one login application for better understanding and first I am giving as usual formalities HTML header section title part HTML forms title close header close body open body close HTML close and inside simple form from open and from close once form close inside whatever required elements available input type is equal to text close that and I am using BR same control I am going to copy paste and I want to replace the text as password small login form I am showing to you and next one submit button I am talking next one I am going to be way set cancel purpose I am using and from inside I'm using label user name yes I am using label break tag amusing and password level also same label I want to copy paste and I want to modify that password yes password write submit button and reset so maximum no attributes available simply one type attribute I use textbox password box submit reset it is a past basic example I am showing to you just observe on the screen and refresh on the web browser and you can able to see and be are available that BR will remove and perfect it will be satellite no BR and no BR yes and refresh so username password submit recent whatever we entered the same values or displaying it for example I entered the name is my name I entered and I am giving password I am clicking reset the values remove so cancel also we can say now we can apply these many attributes on this login form so before I am going to apply first attribute name I made already Java suite purpose logical purpose we are using generally name is equal to I said you name real time industry purpose name attribute compulsory you need to maintain PWD name is equal to SN name is equal to cancel simple I said C and C cancel so name attribute completed run it nothing will be changes same thing now name attribute after I am using value attribute value always visible to the end user value equal to I am writing name name for example enter valid username just I am asking the user please enter your valid username if I say I am going to run on that observe clearly visible to you and if I am going to ran that again value here value equal to enter valid password enter user valid password S will observe that but this is a drawback of here actually my my thinking is different and differently expected but it is giving in an encrypted format okay this is one kind of drawback we can say and come down now while you I am giving value is equal to I am giving sign in sign in again value is equal to clear the data yes you can refresh on the web browser so if you are entering also here you need to select then you need to enter your username otherwise it will be at the data if you are entering so password my password entered I don't want for example this one clear clear it original data k means value attribute automatically appears so name has shown to you value already completed size attribute we can apply and sighs I need small text box so I am applying on that size equal to size equal to I want a 6 a pixel text box enough and refresh observe that Xbox 6 pixel test works and after that there is a max L and attribute available maximum characters so I am taking max a length is equal to I want to take just six characters now you can refresh and enter more than 6 characters remove whatever available Raju 1 2 3 4 5 6 it is not taking because you said 6 characters only max it takes 6 characters after the next attribute is rows/columns this is possible with the text area read-only yes possible here we can apply read-only equal to so once you are coming to my username and you cannot do anything just read-only is equal to I said true for example so whenever you are saying read only true if you are trying to refresh that vessel value came if you are trying to cut this one you are Dilek trying to remove that one nothing possible you want to cut it also right-click so copy available cut is no you can observe so read only just through next one read only after disabled is equal to disabled yes I want to disable more clear so disabled is equal to disabled so whenever I am going to say that disabled is equal to disabled observe now clear but are now enabled refresh that one now disabled try to click on that something data enter here and try to try to click on this so it is unable to work so almost all input level whatever attributes available from our list I made very clear that just observe whatever the attributes are implemented HTML to and top to bottom HTML and M in middle form form level attributes available right the form level attributes first basic level information means basic level input types I am showing to you so these are the basic level input types so completely we did almost all input level attributes right guys we can see after that rows and columns we need apply here so we will try to apply on text area right I am removing all these things and I am applying text area once the text area if you are going to say that and text area level yes completely and your rows available columns available first I need some data there and I am writing google.com just I am opening some kind of what is HTML symbol I type there it is providing some data I am going to copy paste that once copied you can paste in your inside text area just a data purpose and I am going to run on my web browser observe the text area by default two rows only visible and by default 20 columns only visible you want to see more than that practically you can assign for example I want to see rows equal to I want at least minimum 5 I want the calls is equal to 3 0's come and refresh perfect so this is a text area so here named also available name not visibility JavaScript my tea area whenever I am saying that refresh nothing difference available because name always for the JavaScript this is a text area control rows/columns possible here text area is multi-line input text box type now if you are coming that I made already very clear regarding text area level attributes calls rows name calls number rows number and a name is message whatever you are going to supply so after the text area will observe select select means simple we can develop combo box how we are going to develop that so remove this inside from whatever available and I am gaping select select open select close and once you are going to close the select write to close it once select close or inside option available option right option you can select once again that so owns option you selected and I am writing here JavaScript I am writing JavaScript so like that different different values I required before I am going to write more values I am writing my information to the end user select any one item once you are writing a given signal to user very clearly select any one item because combo was single selection then I am writing JavaScript like there's some elements let me copy paste multiple times to come to know for example live script I said JavaScript I said next one is dojo and next one I said jQuery next one I am saying angularjs any value but I am entering JavaScript elated frameworks ember.js and I am entering node.js backbone.js react.js rhyme JS like this number of available lime JS more than 100 JavaScript frameworks are waiting in the market so these are the total option level here also you can mention better value value you can mention LS so like the remaining also you can implement come to on your and select any one item I said so there is that one so how you close you can check it you didn't close properly you didn't open that right select any one item click on that at a time you can able to select only single item now I am selecting live script that's all I am selecting dojo that's all I am selecting angular JS so more than one item unable to select climb J's so combo box means at a point of time we can select only single item select our country best example for the combo box next one same combo box you want to convert into list box then you can do like this select multiple multiple is equal to multiple so it is converting into list box now list box select one or more items select any not one items item you can select or items you can select so I am giving end user to one picture so anyone hold the control key select any number for example no I want to select only three items only two items more than that I do not want allow the end user definitely we can do like that also it is not that matter of how many elements you are selecting based on JavaScript by taking this index we can control only two you want allow only two also you can so depends on business requirements we can do but by default it is allowing multiple items to select from the list box by using multiple is equal to multiple or multiple is equal to on right any one attribute you can use that parameter and next one is radio buttons radio buttons completely different when we are selecting about the gender we are using radio buttons only so how these radio buttons we are applying checkboxes are we are applying what is a button what is reset what is image like that we can see it in advance illa these are basic forms in the video one in the video too I will show you these advanced level form controls thank you for watching my video catch me for more videos on youtube.com slash nourish IIT
