dear elephant here I'm going to show you how to make an image or a link clickable in HTML now I have notepad open here and I'm just going to type some HTML code if we do a which stands for anchor href equals right here we can put and usually have to put it in quotes over well we should put it in quotes you don't have to we can put the link that we want people to go to right there and then whenever we put after that close tag is going to be clickable this can be an image it can be some text it could be whatever now we have to close the a tag your closing HTML tag using that slash and now we have a clickable link that says go YouTube let's make it a go to YouTube now let's make one that's an image in HTML the whitespace in the source code does not matter if I actually want this just to leave some spaces between that link in this image I'm going to put in I have to put in some more HTML code a P stands for paragraph I could have also done a couple of be ours which stands for line breaks and that's a href equals I'll show you that you don't have to have the quotes here google.com now here's an interesting thing the image the source of an image that would even worked got a do HTTP colon slash slash now if I'm going to put an image here I can do image source equals and then quotes close quotes like that now that's nothing's going to show up except maybe if I put in some alternative text which is just for if images or not there anyway we can go out and find an image anywhere on the web any image that you show has to be on the web it's usually in the same site that's showing the image but in this case I'm going to go just kind of borrow on from Google itself this is Google is the alternative text that's what you see if the image doesn't load now let's go find out what our image source is going to be I'm going to go to Google itself and steal their main logo let's go to google.com let's see right here is the image will copy let's see we want to go to properties actually and that is the address and that's we want to copy so I'm clicking to highlight that all right click and do the copy and we'll close this okay close that and we'll go back to our thing here or insert oh I missed a bit right there the image sorcerer in there now let's save this out and look at it and you'll see what I mean we do need to save it as a dot HTM or a dot HTML let's save it on the root of the C Drive so we can find it easily and instead of a text document we need to do let's do all files let's go to the C disk and then let's call this test dot HTML now if we so test about HTML is the name of it if we go and we open that up in our browser and you can do this with file colon slash slash C test our HTML and we have spelled Ryder it doesn't work there we go and that's a link that takes us to YouTube click on that we go to YouTube go back and this is going to take us to Google and that's how you make a hyperlink in HTML
