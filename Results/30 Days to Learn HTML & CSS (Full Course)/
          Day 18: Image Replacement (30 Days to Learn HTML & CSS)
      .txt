many times you don't want to use text for your logo even though it makes sense to add the name of your business within an h1 tag you might prefer to use an image of your logo how would you do that the first step is of course to get your logo if I open up our project you'll see that I've added a net touch logo to the images folder let's learn how to reference it and I'm going to show you two different ways the first step is we could have an h1 tag and we do net types this is the most basic form we're using text for our logo reload the page there you are now we want to change that and use our logo instead one way and this was frowned upon but I think it's okay and a lot of people do if you can simply nest an image tag within here and here we will link to the image IMG so I've seen that touch logo jpg now the reason this is okay for SEO purposes is we can still provide alternate text of net touch that way if images are turned off it'll still display net touch now if I reload the page you see our image this is fine but a more common way is to use image replacement and the way it works is you instead apply the image as a background of the h1 element a lot of people think this is cleaner especially for your markup as well you don't have images it's easier to understand this is my logo so let's do this now h1 and now we're going to specify a background now you know we can use colors like red but we can also specify URLs to the image in this case we'll say IMG net Tut's logo however this is not going to work if I load the page you're not going to see it how come and that's because remember your stylesheet is within the CSS folder however the image is up one folder into the sibling IMG folder and then within it so we need to specify from the current file style that CSS go up to your parent then find a folder called IMG and then get net touch so I'm going to do period period /to go up a folder now if I reload the page you're going to see in this is very odd isn't it remember heading elements have a display of block by default if we wanted to override this to inline you'll see that the width will only be as wide as is necessary so here that touches finish so it immediately cuts off but next if I remove that why is the image repeating the entire width and that's because even though the text only takes up a small portion the heading element takes up the entire width that is allowed as you can see right here if I resize the window if we instead change the body which is the wrapper and we gave it a width of 600 the background would then be stretched for 600 pixels like so but what if we want to say you know what I only want this image to display once why is it repeating at all and it's repeating because it's often times common to use a texture or a grain something like that for a background in which case you do want it to repeat that way you don't have to use a massive image when you just maybe want a little bit of a sand background you can get a tiny fragment a tiny image and then repeat that for the entire width of the window and it saves you a lot of bandwidth now here if we after the URL specify no-repeat and that means don't repeat this image at all other options are repeat X or the default of repeat X and y or just repeat Y alone here we're going to override it no repeat this is a single image and I reload and now it's being displayed like so the next step is though it looks like the image is cutting off a little bit and of course we don't want to display the text itself and the image so maybe we should try to push the text on top all the way off the page and we can do that by specifying a new property text indent now if we were to set that by 10 pixels you'd see the text would be pushed up 10 pixels if I do 50 it's pushed up 50 pixels so why don't we put it a huge number negative and that's going to push it not to the right but to the left and now we're going to push it off huge enough number that it would never show up on a computer screen reload and now it's disappeared but in actuality it's really far off to the left good so now this is looking a lot better our markup looks fine nice and clean but now I see right here it seems as if the image is cutting off and that's because the image itself is taller than the heading text so we can explicitly state what the width is of this image specifically and you can do that by maybe opening up Photoshop or going to the image and viewing get info why don't we do that open this up get info and we can see right here the dimensions are 142 by 43 so let's specify that now come back with 142 pixels in a height of 43 pixels and now the h1 will be set specifically to the dimensions of this image and a text itself will be put off the page reload the page and there we are and we have perfect image replacement so one thing you might be thinking is well why add the name at all because you're just going to push it off the page why don't we remove the name and then you can get rid of this property entirely reload and it looks the same and you're right it does look the same but it's not the same the difference is what if the browser does not have images turned on in that case they would see nothing at all what if the image does not load for some reason maybe it's not referenced properly maybe you accidentally delete the image in the future again nothing at all would display also maybe what if CSS was disabled entirely in that case the image would not show up because we're adding it so once again nothing would be displayed surely you see where I'm getting so always make sure you add it here and you use a text indent technique to push it off the page that way you're good in most situations reload the page and now you've done your first image replacement
