hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series in the previous tutorial we understood there are three different types of lists we can create in HTML order lists unordered lists and definition lists we already understood how we can create order lists how we can create unordered lists and how we nest one list inside another list in this tutorial I am going to discuss definition list which is a third type of a list that we can create in HTML I double click on the first page dot HTML I right click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad first thing I set the title de fi ni tion definition list file save go to browser refresh you can see that title is set here I have a WordPad document right click open with the word pad in this WordPad document you can see that I have definitions for different terms computer what is a definition for computer computer is an electronic device it accepts data as an input processes it and produces information as an output 'html what is HTML HTML is a formatting language for web pages it is used to create structure of a web page CSS what is CSS or definition for CSS CSS adds design aesthetics to web pages it is used to stylize web page and make it appealing what is javascript javascript is a scripting language used to add behavior to web pages if I want to convert this WordPad document to web page there are many ways one of the simplest way is to create definition list to create a definition list in HTML we are going to use a tag called as DL now definition list is a pair tag so I must and should write the closing DL so we have a opening DL tag and a closing real tag inside this definition list we have to create def nation terms and definition data to give a definition term we are going to use DT dagger now DT tag is a pair tag so I am going to write a closing DT tag in between these two tags we have to give definition term that is computer : file save go to browser refresh you can see that it is showing computer : now we need to give definition to computer to write a definition data we are going to write DD tag now DD tag is also a pair tag so I am going to write here closing DD in between these two tags we have to give the definition for computer I am going to copy this from here right click copy and paste it in notepad we have written here definition for computer in DD tag let's see what happens file save go to browser refresh you can see that automatically it is indented one step forward and definition is displayed something like this similarly I can add more definition terms and definition data right so I am going to copy this paste it down here we are going to give definition term html4 the definition term I paste it in DD tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have one more definition added automatically formatting is done by HTML itself you can see that I can add one more definition copy paste it down so here I can say CSS I am going to copy the content from here paste it in definition data attack file save go to browser refresh I'm going to add one more let me copy this and say ctrl V here I am going to give JavaScript then I copy the definition for JavaScript from here and paste in between daily tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that we have created definition list very easily by using the definition list tag in HTML this is a third type of list that you can create in HTML hope you guys have understood how you can use DL tag DT tag and DD tag for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial
