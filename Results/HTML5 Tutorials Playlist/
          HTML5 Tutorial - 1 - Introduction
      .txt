what is going on guys my name is Bucky Robertson welcome to your very first tutorial in html5 now in this tutorial series what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be taking you from a complete noob in html5 to a seasoned vet teaching you guys all little tricks all the tips giving you guys all the information you need to create awesome websites so for you guys who are like okay I don't even know what the heck html5 is well I kind of just gave it away it's basically a way where you can create awesome sweet epic websites so if you're saying okay I thought I learned about web development before but maybe not well I want to tell you guys this if you are completely new to web development and you never made a website before then I would highly recommend you check out my XHTML and CSS videos and then my JavaScript tutorials once you do this you're going to be ready to move on to html5 if you kind of skip over these and this is the very first video you're watching on what development I'm going to be moving kind of fast and you might get kind of lost so I just want to tell you guys that first now if you're like okay what the heck is all this crap I'll give you guys a five second introduction XHTML is basically the core basic elements of a website it's basically like your foundation CSS is how you make everything look pretty at some colors arrange the pictures nicely and JavaScript provides functionality interactivity it lets the user interact and basically makes your webpage a whole lot smarter so with the basics with making it look pretty in by making it smarter you guys might think okay so that's basically everything I need to make an awesome website well html5 is kind of like an XHTML CSS in JavaScript burrito it ties all of it together makes it a whole lot better and it's just going to take your web development to the next level so that's what you guys have to look forward to it's going to be awesome and amazing so as we can clearly see from just browsing the web that the website isn't like it was in like the 1990s it's no longer just static and information like reading a book online but it's becoming more interactive in media based so that's where we're going to be learning to do with html5 kind of like I said taking our websites and web pages to the next level so before we begin before we start typing a whole bunch of code I want to mention a few things we need a couple tools in order to write html5 the first tool we need is a text editor now you already have a text editor probably already on your computer called notepad however this is a really dull and boring and simple one it's not the best so what I would recommend doing is downloading this one right here this is called notepad plus plus if you go ahead and type that in Google you can find it and download it for free but this is a text editor that I would recommend it's the one I always use and you guys are going to thank me so much for telling you guys about this did I mention it's free oh yeah it's free so aside from a basic text editor you also need Google Chrome now that's kind of lie because you can test your html5 websites in any web browser but Google Chrome is a web browser that's always up to date with the latest html5 stuff so if you're using Internet Explorer or Firefox then I would recommend switching over to Google Chrome because like I said it's always up to date and aside from that I'm going to be testing all my sites in Google Chrome so if you want to follow along and do exactly like I'm doing then it's probably best you get the same tools that I'm using so anyways those are the two things you need actually three things you need a text editor you need a web browser hopefully Google Chrome and you need some ambition but hopefully you guys got out that already so anyways once you are all set up and ready to go you're ready to move on to my next tutorial where we are going to be creating the basic shell of an html5 website so it's going to be awesome and amazing thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
