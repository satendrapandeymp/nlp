hey YouTube how's it goin it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 42 and in this tutorial I want to take a look at forms again as I want to continue styling my form and right now I've gone a while I'm starting from the same code that I had in the previous tutorial so if you watch the previous tutorial this is exactly where we ended off with our HTML and then again the CSS exactly the same thing you will notice however that in my browser right now I have a slightly different form and this is basically what I want to try and create in this tutorial so basically whenever you're working with the form you kind of want to make the labels and the input elements kind of line up and get the button lining up as well so you just want to try and get all the spacing in here is what I'm saying you want to try and make this look a little bit more neat and tidy than some of the previous forms that we've seen in the previous tutorials so yeah let's take a look at how to do that and so I'm going to hit refresh and yeah this is basically what we should be starting with in this tutorial so let's go ahead and make all of those changes right so the first thing I want to do is jump back up in my browser and I want to copy this entire line and paste it down here with the break tags with so we're getting rid of those breaks and I think wherever I see name I'm just going to change that to password so password and password and pop web password and password so yeah basically just copied and pasted that line and changed all the all the values for the full attribute to type to the name and the ID right so now if we take a look at this lebra in the browser let's refresh you can see that first of all everything is now on one line and secondly the password styling doesn't really match the input hole a text styling a via even though they are more or less the same element right so let's go ahead and change that or fix that by jumping over to our CSS and here where I have a styling rule for my text input I can go ahead and just copy that and style the password field in exactly the same way you simply just select password instead of an input with the type of text you want to select the input of type password right save that and yeah just to kind of give a quick recap basically whenever you separate elements with a comma it means that you can then style more than one element at a time so we're styling our text element and we're styling our input element or our input of type password elements right so let's come back here and refresh and now you can see the password field and the name fields pretty much look the same now so that's cool but I want to work on getting them to display in multiple lines or on separate lines so one of the ways I go about doing that is by just breaking that one down one line and breaking that down one line and I actually surround these in divs so I'm just going to create a little bit of spacing here and then basically indent everything and so within my form I want to create a div and I'm going to give that a class of row or we can give a class of form - row and then below the so we want to include the label and we want to include the input element so below that input element I'm going to close that deal off right and I'm going to do the exact same thing for the next row so we want to include the password label and then I want to also include the password element and then I'm going to end that off here alright then the next thing I want to do is well yeah basically do the exact same thing again for the submit button except our submit button doesn't have a label so this is just going to be a button and that's why it will display underneath all the labels so let's save this now and jump back over to the browser and refresh you can see that's looking a little bit better everything is on multiple lines but there is no spacing so to fix that up a little bit what I'd like to do is jump back over to CSS and then select my form - Rome and give that a margin now I want to give it a margin not just a margin bottom of 10 pixels and zero pixels and what that does is space it out a little bit more but one of the things that you'll notice now is that your name field is a little bit longer or a little bit shorter than the password field so then these two text boxes don't really line up and that's not cool because it doesn't look very tidy so we want to just try and get these things to line up and make them look a little bit more tidy so what you do that is by jumping back over to CSS or backing over to your HTML rather and within that div within your div row you want to create another div so I'm going to go ahead and create a div over here and we'll take that ending to ending tag or that ending div and place it underneath the label and basically push that label in one further right and then I want to give this a class of form - label right so that is our label and essentially I want to do the exact same thing for my input element so let's open up another div over here indent that and then and also our div right so basically this is kind of what you're going for you can copy and paste this down over the rest of the elements and that's exactly what I'll do but I just want to change this class from form - label to form inputs right so we've got a row then we've got a label and an input so I'm going to save all of this now and then I'm going to copy everything and skip to the part where I've already done that alrighty so I'm back and up basically what I've done is copied that same kind of HTML structure down to our password so our password now has a surrounding div or form label or the label for our password has a surrounding give our form label and the password field has a surrounding div of form input which is good and you'll see I haven't actually followed through with that same HTML structure with our input button and I think the reason for that is because if you look at this input input button is fine where it is right I think below the label I mean we're not going to create another label that says click the button or something like that so I'm fine with having the button display all the way on the end underneath our labels where it is right now all right so if I save this HTML and I jump back over to the browser and refresh I'm going to see a small change so let's refresh and you can see that basically what has happened is this input box has fell below the label and the reason for that is obviously because we've surrounded them in divs but what I'd like to do now is have the label and the input element display next to each other and the way I do that is jump back over to CSS and select my elements now before I select those two divs what I really like to do is also add a background of red to our form row and the reason why I'm doing this is just to kind of make it really obvious what's going on because I'm going to be floating and clearing a few things and so yeah let's just save this jump back over to the browser and you can see that now each of my form rows has a red background to them so that's one row that's another row and that's another row we can clearly see that and what I'd like to do is select my form - label and I'm going to float that to the left right left right okay and then I'm going to select my form input so basically the same thing and I want to float that to the left now something else I'd really like to do when floating these elements is to just give them a width so I'm going to give this one a width of 20% and then I'm going to give my form input a width of 80% because basically when I'm floating these two things next to each other I want the total width of both of them to equal to 100% so 20 plus 80 is 100 and let's come back here and refresh and now you can see quite a lot has changed so our label and our input boxes are kind of lining up right now but there is a slight problem because yeah the spacing that we had between our elements has now gone so these two input boxes are kind of rubbing up against each other and that's not cool so I kind of like to fix I kind of like to fix the spacing over here so one thing we can do to fix laughs is use something called a clear fix and the reason why we need to use a clear fix is because we've floated our label to the left and we floated our input box to the right but there's nothing underneath each one of these floated elements that's clearing the floated space right and when I spoke about floating and clearing in the previous tutorial I kind of made mention to the fact that when you float something you kind of need a clear it so yeah to fix that I want to just make use of a clear fix so I'm going to select my forum row and then I'm going to add a pseudo selector to this so to create or to select a pseudo selector we're using that double colon and I'm going to go ahead and say after and basically after my forum row what I'd like to do is add in some content so let's add in a word like here okay and the reason why I said or I'm the reason why I'm using a big word like here is just make this very obvious to you guys what's going on so there we go right after each forum row I've added the text here below the forum row and what that has done is now created the spacing or given that spacing back to us underneath each one of these forum rows but you know that doesn't look all that good so most of the time when people use the clear fix they actually just put a full-stop or something in here because it's a little bit less obvious but even that you can still see the full stop and that kind of sucks because we don't want to see that so yeah basically what we want to do is a set visibility equal to hidden so that we don't see that full stop so I'm going to save this now and jump back over to the browser so now the full stops gone but you can see that we still have like a little bit of extra space underneath each one of our input elements and the reason for that is because this pseudo element this form row after is still taking up some height and we want to get rid of that height right so I'm going to set height equal to zero but I know for a fact that this isn't going to work unless I place display block in here as an attribute or yeah as a styling property as well so let's save this now and jump back over to the browser and refresh and I broke something what did I break content visibility:hidden height zero pixels maybe save that ah wait okay I know what I haven't done what I haven't done is clear both alright and that's the entire reason I actually said that we needed to make this form element right so let's come back here and refresh and now you can see what we've done is we've placed our label to this side our input element to this side so everything's kind of lining up and what I'd really like to do is get rid of that background because that is really throwing us off a little bit so let's remove that property save this come back over the browser and refresh and now our form is looking much much better you can see that all of our labels kind of have a specific amount of space which will be from here to here and then our input elements can take up the rest of the space as needed and then at the bottom submit button kind of lines up with the labels so everything looks nice and neat and tidy and yeah I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at their mountains they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that while you're still here there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
