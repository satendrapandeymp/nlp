hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 25th deed role in this course and in this tutorial we're gonna talk about the background color attribute that you can use with the several elements in HTML now this is the table that we construct in the last role when we made the table tag in HTML and you know it's different in the sense that we have different background colors for the four rows in the table and the rest everything is the same the values or the heading or the title so let me show you guys you know the code behind the page and this is what it is so you know you have the doctype declaration on line number one and then between the opening and closing HTML tags you have the head section the body section the body section has the heading for the document on line number seven between the opening and closing h1 tags and the heading is tables in HTML and then you have the table tag on line number 8 the border for the table is one pixel and thickness cell padding one pixel spacing one pixel and then we have the BG color attribute that I have used with the the first row as well as the other rows actually but then the first row has the value green for the BG color attribute and you know you can use the BG color attribute with the other tags as well so let's say you want to have an orange background you know for the entire page so you know you can use a BG color attribute with the body you know element here so I go to body tag on line number 6 I'll give a space after the word body type in BG color the equal to symbol and then I'll type in orange right I'll save the file and i refresh it in my browser and there we go we have you know the orange background for the entire page so what I mean to say is that you can use a BG color attribute with the Lord of different elements in in HTML and you can have you know different background colors so let's come back to your table so I have used the BG color attribute with the first row on line number nine and I have given the background color green to the first row and similarly I've given the background color yellow to the second row and you know that is for the TR tag on line number fourteen and then I have given the background color blue for the third row I've given the background color pink for the fourth row over here right on line number twenty four I have the opening and closing I have the opening TR tag and then I have the closing TR tag for the last row on line number 20 here so you know that's it for this tutorial I just wanted to you know show you guys that you can change the background color for different parts of your web page by using the BG color attribute and these days mostly people you CSS to you know change background color and everything and the BG color attribute does not use much actually so you know but anyway this is a feature of HTML so that's why I discussed it with you and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready I'll see you guys in the next video till then take care
