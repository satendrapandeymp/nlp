hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 19th tutorial in this course and in this tutorial we'll be checking out ordered lists in HTML and order lists are less that have you know some sequence right and the you know a sequence that can be observed so let's say you have a you know a list of countries ranked in order of you know population or rank an order of life expectance and you want to you know display that the list of countries on your website in that case it would make sense if you would use an ordered list because you will be able to display the ranking as in one you know some country and at number two you have another country and number three you have not going to be so the example that I have here is not of Nations but of tennis players so I went to a DPS website and I checked out you know the current rankings of players and this is in May 2014 so you know if you're watching this eat order later date then you know this order could be different you know Djokovic could be on top and Nadal could be at number two or you know who knows maybe water drinker could be the best tennis player in the world you know six months later so anyway that's not concern ourselves with that you know let's just see how we can create an order list in HTML so the element that you have to use is the o L element but before I get to that let's see what we have in the body section first so I have the center tag on line number seven and after that I have the h1 heading tag and between the opening and closing h1 tags I have the text ordered lists example and I have closed myself tag so this is what's going to appear at the center of the webpage and it's going to be bold and it's going to be large in size because I've used the h1 heading tag here and then on the next line I have you know the element o L which is a short form for order lists and I have the corresponding closing oil tag on line number 14 and between these two tags I have several list items so you know to have these each of these list items I have used the Li tag which is a part of the oil element so you have a opening a tie tag and the closing at I drag in between that you have you know list item that you wish to display so rafael nadal is the first item that it has to go in the list because he's currently ranked number one so that's why Rafael Nadal is you know the first item and then you have knock Novak Djokovic at number two then wobbling card three federate four and Ferrer at five and if you would open this page in Google room this is how it would look so you would have rankings of tennis players this way one two three four five and then you would have the names now let's say you don't want to use numbers and instead you want to use or alphabets so that's also pretty simple all you have to do is you know go to the oil element in your page and after Oh L give space and type in type and this is an attribute for the oil element and as a value to it let's say you want to use a small case alphabet so you just type in a here and save the file and go to Google and refresh the page and there we go we see that the numbers have been replaced by small lowercase alphabets right and if you want to use uppercase alphabets and you can change this to capital a and go back to my web page refresh the browser and there we go we see that we get capital case letters now and if you want to use a you know Roman letters and that's also possible like let's say you want to use lowercase Roman letters letters then you know just type in small I and I'll refresh the page and we see Roman numerals this time and let's say you want to use uppercase Roman numerals you type in capital I and i refresh the page and this is what I see right so order lists are very useful and I'm sure that you know the websites that you've seen have used order lists at some place with the other and you know you would find them really useful and you would want to use them at a lot of places trust me on that so anyway that's it for now in the next tutorial we're going to check out unordered lists and I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I'll see you the next video till then take care
