what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 36th XHTML and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about something called positioning so before whenever we are making websites and we added like an image and then a header and then a paragraph and then you know maybe some links or something everything kind of appeared after one another kind of flowed together in a nice in the order I mean your image new automatically not to appear on top of your text to cover it up and whenever you made a paragraph it didn't just put them in a random location it put it under whatever was there before like under your header or under your image so everything kind of flowed automatically but while this is good if you're going for that you know kind of boring organized look it didn't give you a whole lot of control over the layout and look of your website so in this is our oh I'm going to teach you guys how to change all that using something called absolute positioning now let's go ahead and look at an example right now so I'm going to make two divs or aka two boxes on the screen and I'm going to show you guys how to move them around exactly where you want so let's go ahead and make a div with ID of I don't know apples and just go ahead and end that div let's add some text in that I am the Apple box isn't there cereal like Apple Jacks that's what I was thinking of so let's go ahead and copy this and add another div with ID blueberry and just put like Yolo so Lyon blueberry this can be a Mexican blueberry box so anyways go ahead and save this and see what we have on our screen so far we have I am the Apple box and yo soy blueberry the blueberry box so in order to you know visualize these a little better let's go ahead up in CSS and give them a border you know actually so they actually look like boxes so go ahead and in your apples let's add some rules to it border equals two pics solid red because apples are red they might make it easier to tell and let's see in order to apply that absolute positioning here's what you need to do type in the attribute position and for the value type absolute and now well uh it's better if I just show you what absolute positioning is so anyways just leave it like this my newest since these are boxes we need to give them a couple things first of all a width in the height so CSS knows how wide and how tall to draw that border and also a top in the left or pretty much coordinate so it knows where on the screen to draw the border so with equals I don't know let's say 150 pixels and height equals hundred seventy five pixels that'll be good for this resolution so now we need to say where on the screen do you want to draw this box well 30 pixels down from the top is good and let's say right in other words 15 pixels from the left so now let's go ahead and save this and see what we got we got a red box to pixel solid red it's absolute in the width is 150 by 175 and it's 30 pixels down from the top and 15 pixels from the right so now you're saying this is pretty cool because now I can have my elements and boxes and I can move them anywhere I want around the screen so for example your boss comes in he's like Bucky and make this a hundred more pixels to the right and I mark in some more pixels down sort of saying alright now I can add 100 pixels of that and instead of 30 put it like 40 and save it in BAM check it out move it over some and move it down some pretty cool but now we're going to run into a problem and that's this it's not so much a problem as something that you just need to look out for go ahead and copy this and let's see if this works go ahead and now let's make a box for blueberry and let's first of all make that border blue so we can see what we're doing and make the width mm I mean those look pretty good so change this to 30 and you know 15 whoa easy Hoss so now in our blueberry box we have a blue border the position is absolute still the width and height they're the same but it's just at different coordinates so now whenever we save this and refresh this we see that something weird happens that didn't happen before with absolute positioning absolute positioning basically says our a I'm going to give you complete control over where to place your elements but I don't care if any other element is in my way I don't care if any other boxes in my way if it is I'm just going to overlap it F it I only care about myself so while this is an excellent way to position elements on the screen exactly where you want them you need to look out for a couple things first of all before whenever we just made dumb old web sites everything was positioned nice and neatly now we run into the problem of things might having to bump into each other or overlapping so whenever you're making your websites you have to make sure don't overlap your stuff or it's going to be hard to read I mean look it this is a you know this would be pretty hard to read if we had two paragraphs in here and you overlap them and try to read them together so anyways whenever you're making a website you have to watch out not to overlap your stuff right now because even though we have control over exactly where things go we have to watch out not to make them bump into each other so anyways it doesn't flow like other XHTML would just by default and anyways you guys can see what's going on so this is basically absolute positioning the idea that you can take an element and put it absolutely in a location no matter what else is in the way so saying all right this is pretty cool I'm just going to take all my elements and arrange them make sure they don't overlap and I'm just going to make a website like that well before you're just going and before you just go and make an entire website out of absolute positioning there are two other forms of positioning I want to teach you guys about and when you use them together it's going to give you a whole lot more control and it's going to make your website so much better so before you just go make a website with tons of boxes like this all over stick with me for the next couple of tutorials I'm going to be teaching you about some different types of positioning and trust me you will thank me by the end of these tutorials so anyways thank you guys for watching hopefully you guys understand the concept of absolute positioning and if you don't then just stick with me in these next couple stories you will so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
