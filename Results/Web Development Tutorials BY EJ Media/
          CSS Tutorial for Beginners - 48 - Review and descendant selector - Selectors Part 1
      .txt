over the next four to five videos we're going to review selectors now of course we've been talking about selectors throughout this entire series so you have a very good idea of what they are so again these next four to five videos will serve more as a review but also I will be introducing some new selectors as well as some new concepts and new ways to think about selectors because selectors are very very important to CSS they are fundamental and of course we know now that is a two-step process we need to target the element that we want to target that's the first step and we do that of course through the selector and then we need to style the content now the first type of selector that we've been talking about is the type selector and this is one of the most basic type of selectors we are just selecting the element by type a very simple process so we could select the h1 we could select the h2 we could select a paragraph we would just put a P there or we could select a div we would just put div there again we are just selecting the element by its type so let's go ahead and style this and we're just going to change the color of the text the point of these videos is not styling we're actually talking about this part the selector so let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh our page and there you can see we've got our blue text now the next major selector that we've been talking about of course is the ID selector and that of course is where we select the element with the hashtag buy ID and we put that right here and in this paragraph element we said ID equals para 1 and remember with the ID we usually will not be reusing this in other elements it's usually specific to one element that we want to style so let's just go ahead and change the text to green and we'll refresh our page and there you can see we've got our green text now the next major selector of course is the class selector and you will remember that we always select that element with a dot that is how we select it in CSS and you can see that right here dot para and the nice thing about this of course is we can reuse the class over and over again in other elements and that's what I've done here this paragraph element is using the para class and this paragraph element is using the para class so we can reuse this over many many times and all we need to do again is use that dot so let's go ahead and change the color texts to orange will refresh our page and there you can see we have our orange text now now we can also combine selectors so we can put multiple selectors in one of our rule sets so let's do that let's take let's take the h2 and we'll put that in here and of course we need a comma that's how we separate when we use multiple selectors and let's go ahead and we'll style against the h3 and we can reuse any other selector we want we can reuse the ID selector so let's put that in here as well and then what we'll do is we'll underline the text so we'll go ahead and refresh and there you can see the text in the h2 and the h3 are now underlined as well as the paragraph element with the ID now the key again is you want to use that comma if you don't CSS will get confused and think you're using a descendant selector which is what we're going to talk about right now and the descendant selector always selects an element inside another element and so that element which is inside another element is the descendant so in this case we have a div element and we have a paragraph element inside that div so this paragraph element is a descendant of the div so keep in mind here we are using the relationship to target this paragraph element that is the div is essentially an ancestor of the paragraph element and we do that over here by specifying div first and then the descendant which is the P and we put no comma there you only actually use a space so that's how you use a descendant selector so let's italicize the text so let's go ahead and refresh this and there you can see our text is now italicized and we used a descendant selector to target this paragraph element so that's what all these selectors do it's just a different way to target these elements now the descendant selector has a selector that's very similar to it it's called the child selector and that is what we're going to talk about in the next video we're actually going to introduce a new selector it's called the child selector and I'll talk about the differences between the two in the next video see you guys
