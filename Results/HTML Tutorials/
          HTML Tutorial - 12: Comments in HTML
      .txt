hello guys welcome to my channel this is the twelfth tutorial in this course and in this tutorial we'll be talking about comments in HTML now those of you who programmed in other languages would be knowing how useful comments are so you know if you're into the business of writing code and sharing it with people then commenting your code is extremely important because you know if you do something and if you do it in a certain way then you should explain why you've done it in that way so that it's easier for other people to just read your code and understand what's going on right and even if you was at your own gold six months later sometimes if you have a long and complicated program it's hard for you to figure out you know why you've done certain things in certain ways and in those situations if you have your code well commented then it's much easier to make sense of things so over here I've got a very simple HTML file and it has a title comments and HTML in the body section and I just have one paragraph of text which has the text I am a very lazy person I don't do any work and just keep eating junk food all day long and this is me or this was me until a few weeks ago actually so anyway so you know the file in Webre in google chrome looks like this obviously it doesn't do anything fancy it's called one paragraph of text right now let's say I want to add a comment here and comments you know those of you who haven't programmed in other languages for those guys comments are you know pieces of text that you insert in your HTML file and those pieces of text are not displayed when you open your files in any web browser and the web browser just you know ignores those pieces of text so you can type in anything that you want as long as you're not violating the rules of commenting in HTML right so let me tell you what the rules are firstly you get in your opening angular bracket or the lesson symbol right and then you get in the exclamation symbol and then you type in two hyphens right so this is the way you begin comments in HTML I know you know those of you who've programmed in let's say see this is actually a very long process because you need four characters for it you know see you just need two characters but anyway this is how you start comments in HTML so you require four characters and then you can type in anything that you want to type in so let's say I want to type in this is a comment and then I can also take it on the next line so your comment can span multiple lines this is a comment it won't do anything to my webpage right let's say I want to have this as my comment now I want to close it so the way you close your comment is you get in those two hyphens again and then you just get in your closing angular bracket without getting in the exclamation symbol over here right so this sequence is not the same as the sequence over here you have the exclamation symbol and over here you don't have the exclamation symbol you just have the two hyphens and the closing angular bracket or the greater than symbol and over here you have the less than symbol and the exclamation symbol and then you have the two hyphens right so as soon as I get this closing angular bracket you would see that the you know text editor restored the color of all the tags in the text and earlier it was all light green because you know it assumed that all the following text was part of the comment so I'll save this file now and I'll go to my web browser I'll refresh it and I see that nothing has changed right so Google Chrome has done absolutely nothing with my comment and that's what I was expecting so that's it for this tutorial and I assume the next video in which we will discuss more HTML tags more features and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready and if you have doubts you can obviously comment or you can send me messages on youtube or on Facebook or Google+ and I also have a Twitter profile now so you know you can also catch me there if you want to and see you the next video till then take care
