in this video we're going to take a first look at buttons in bootstrap and of course buttons are very important to your webpage they are what the user usually sees when they need to click on something so bootstrap provides very nice classes that you can call to display some very nice buttons so we're going to examine those in this video the first point I want to make is that you can create buttons on three different types of HTML tags the button element the anchor element in the input element we're going to go ahead and work against the input element but again you can use them with a button and anchor tags so here you can see I've defined a very basic button and of course we set the type of button and here's the bootstrap class that we're going to call it's called BTN and that's pretty much the format that you use for all bootstrap buttons so this will give you the most basic button now if you're following along you may want to go ahead and add this to your style sheet use the type selector input and add a margin of 5 pixels and that way our buttons aren't crunched right up in the corner so that's what I added there but again we're gonna go ahead and call this very first bootstrap button so let's go ahead and load up our page and there you can see we've got a default button not much to this just a very basic button so let's go ahead and copy and paste this line or we're going to do that several times in this video because we're gonna create several different buttons so the first class that we want to call is the default button and that's just going to be simply BTN - default that's it so this will give us the default but so let's go ahead and refresh our page over here and as you can see here is the default button class and it adds a little bit more you can see we've got a border now we've got some shading and if we put the cursor over the submit button we get a gray background so it's flipping the background so that's a lot nicer as you can see now bootstrap also provides a whole different number of classes these ones I'm going to show you next are basically color so if you want a different color you can call that class instead so I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste this several times over I think we need I think there's seven of these so let's do this seven times so now what I'm going to do is go ahead and fill all these different classes in right here there is a primary button that you can call and you'll see these in a moment you'll see that they're just really different colors so don't worry so much about the name you just want to pay attention to the color and maybe that's the color you want for your button there's a success one okay good so let's go ahead and save this and let's refresh our page over here and there you can see we've got all these different colors the primary button is this navy blue the success button is the green and actually later on when we fool around with JavaScript will actually flip the color of these buttons so maybe what we'll do is we'll have two different types so for instance maybe we'll have the submit button this gray and then when you hit it it'll turn green so you can also use these buttons with JavaScript but you could also just use them on your webpage if you like the color itself there are many different ways you can use these bootstrap classes okay so that's an initial look at the buttons now let's take a look at some different things you can do with some of these bootstrap button classes and they have a lot of cool features that you can use now the first thing we're going to do is talk about the size of the buttons themselves there are four different sizes there is extra large medium small and extra small default is medium size so that's what we have right here but as I said you can change these as well so let's go ahead and we'll create another button here and let's do it for the primary button so let's go ahead and just copy and paste this down here let's go ahead and we're going to create a larger button so we'll create a larger sized button and you can do that off the first class that we call this BTN so you just say - LG and that will create a larger sized primary button now if you wanted a smaller button you would just put SM here instead of LG but we're gonna go ahead and create a larger button so let's see what we get here let's refresh our page and there you can see look we've got a larger primary but now as you know buttons by default are inline elements so you can see these are all in line but what if you want the button to stretch across the entire page what if you want it to be a block level element well you can do that as well so let's go ahead and copy and paste this let's go right down here and we're just going to go ahead and call another class you see how bootstrap works you're just calling classes that's why it's so nice and that's why it's so popular a lot of people like to use bootstrap because it's very easy you're just calling classes and in this case we're gonna call the BTN - block class that's all we do so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see look at that this stretch is now all the way across the page so that's something you can do as well now what if you want an active button and a disabled button well let's go ahead and first start with active and we'll go ahead and just copy and paste this last button we did and what we're gonna do is type in the key word active so we're gonna get rid of the block and let's first go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see we've got an active button you know I want you to notice the difference between this primary button and this one notice this is a little bit darker so that's to signify that this is more of an active button so again you can see this a little bit darker other than that it's pretty much the same other than it's sort of giving you more of an active feel I guess that's the way I want to put it now what I really want to show you is what a disabled button looks like so let's go ahead and copy and paste this line and what we're going to do is just type in the word disabled and let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page now notice this when I hover over this no effect take a look at that this button is completely disabled okay we're going to continue on with buttons in the next video
