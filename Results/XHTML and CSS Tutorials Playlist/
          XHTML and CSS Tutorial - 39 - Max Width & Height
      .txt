alright guys welcome back to your thirty ninth tutorial on CSS N and this is aural I'm going to teach you guys how to automatically set the maximum width and maximum height of images or actually any elements using CSS now I set images because that's what most commonly you apply it to for example why would you want to set the maximum height of something if you can just automatically size it using XHTML or you know some photo editing software why do you need explicitly tell CSS that you need a maximum height for an image well for example say you're doing this say you're making a website that you're later wanting to turn into your blog or something and you're always copying images from other websites and posting on your website first of all I'm pretty sure that's illegal so don't do it but other than that the sizes are always different and you're always giving pretty much random pictures and putting on your website so therefore if you don't want to always have to go into your photo editing program and resize everything you can just tell CSS this is the size that I want this image to be and aside from that another example that's probably even better example if you ever went to ebay everyone always uploads photos of all their items and they're all different sizes different types but when ebay displays them on their main page they're all the nice little same sized thumbnail so in order to get all a bunch of different photos the same size you need to give it a kind of guideline so let's go ahead and first and by the way I'm going to be working with images in this tutorial but you can be working with any element you want so anyways I'm going to go ahead and use three images that I have on my computer source equals my face dot ping and let's just go ahead and copy this and paste it down here twice and my face stopping and aside from that I have one called Madden 1.jpg and lastly I have sell JPEG so now let's go ahead and save this and see what beautiful website we got whoa hey mama I mean my face is a pretty good size for this but scroll down here whoa mom I'm gonna have to scroll all over to see this big whopping humping thing and also geez Louise that is one big seller right there so say say I was selling my face and Madden for Xbox and also a cell of my body on eBay well this thing just isn't going to work so here's what I would need to do in order to set a maximum size putt for all images on your web page here's what you need to do go ahead and type image as your element then as your rules the first property that we're going to alter is max - height and now for the value go ahead and put a pixel size so for example 200 pixels would be appropriate and then under this might as well set max width while you're here max width and might as well make this one 200 pixels - why the heck not so now what we're telling our browser is this all right if you have any image that's taller than 200 pixels shrink it down to 200 pixels if you have any image that's fatter than 200 pixels skinny it up to 200 pixels and we do this so the big images fit nicely on our small web page so now let's go ahead and save this and see what happens it took all those images that were bigger and it shrunk them down so they nicely fit or fit nicely if you prefer that on our web page so pretty cool it kept the same you know aspect ratio and that is what we got so aside from that another thing you can use this too but it's not as commonly used is actually men with and min height and I don't even have to tell you what got those do so you know but anyways the only times actually never use those the only really rule I ever use is max height and max width and I do this too a lot whenever I'm like uh like if I made an auction website for someone I would take all their images and Sheree come down and thumbnails so all the websites look the same or if you made a website like Facebook or something where everyone was uploading huge images the size of billboards then you might want to shrink it you know to fit it on there nice profile picture so anyways that is the idea behind max height in max width it's very easy to understand and there's your example and don't forget you can use this with all elements not only images with tables and you know other stuff too so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
