hello guys welcome to my channel this is the ninth tutorial and in this tutorial we'll be checking out the big and small tags in HTML now these are two tags you know which people rarely ever use because you know there are other ways of achieving what you normally achieve with these tanks but then there are also some websites that use these tags extensively so if you ever bump into you know any of those websites and you should know what these tags are you know they just you know like result in to a very simple effect so the big tag you know lets you have some text with a greater font size than the rest of the text that you have in your paragraph and it just raises the font size by one right so I've got two paragraphs in the body section of my webpage here and both the paragraphs have h1 headings and some text between those headings so on line number seven I have the text the big lebowski and on line number eight I have the text the small wonder and you know the world big in the sentence the big lebowski has been enclosed between opening big tag and the closing big tag which is you know just the word big and the you know word big with a forward slash at the beginning and then on line number eight I have the text a small wonder with the word small enclosed between small tag and the closing small tag and the small tank works in the opposite way so whereas the big tag would raise the level of text by one the small tag would decrease the level of text by one and reason why I have these as headings and not just normal paragraph text is because I want these effects to kind of be prominent so that it's easier for us to make out you know how these tags work so now I'll show you how this file looks in Google Chrome and when we take a look at it we see that D and lebowski you know in the first paragraph have the same font size whereas the word big is you know slightly bigger so it's one size greater and in the second sentence on the other hand we have the words D and Wonder with the same font size in the word small is slightly smaller than you know the other two words so this is about the big and small tanks and I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial soon the next one which we'll discuss more times more features and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready an hour see you soon until then take care
