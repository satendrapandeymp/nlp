hey everybody this is roberto blake of robertoblake.com helping you create something awesome today so today we have another HTML for beginners tutorial we're gonna be using adobe dreamweaver because it's what I like to use it's easy for me to demonstrate this for you guys and since I'm using the entire Adobe Creative Cloud and paying 50 bucks a month I'm just gonna take advantage of that so let's go ahead and jump right into today's tutorial today's tutorial is going to be how to change the color of a hyperlink now in a previous tutorial we already talked about how to create hyperlinks we've talked about styles before with our how to use paragraphs tutorial so this is just kind of a bridge of a lot of those things we're going to learn how to manipulate the colors of a text hyperlink and it's really not that hard so the first thing you have to do is make a text hyperlink and we've already covered how to do that if you missed that tutorial you want to go back and watch it because it's gonna really help you here the next thing we need to do is we need to think about the different aspects of a hyperlink when a hyperlink has been made we can set a default color in this case it's green when we hover over it it's going to change to red that's why we need this hover state if it's been visited it will turn to blue and if we're on that page it will turn to black so we wanted to assign different color values to it just based on what's going on so that our user has an experience and understands what they've done or what they're doing now you don't always have to follow this you can make it whatever colors you want and you don't have to necessarily let the user know that they're doing something specifically different if you feel you want to just maintain the color you can go ahead and eliminate the majority of these and just go with the a link color and that will be fine so in this case if we decide to just cut all of this which we could do when we hover over this you notice that there's no change it doesn't change color it doesn't get an underline it doesn't do anything so I'm just gonna put this back and you're gonna see that now when we hover over this it turns red and it gets an underline and that's because here in the hover we've set the text decoration to say underline and we've got the color as red now we do have other options we could make this a line through so now when we hover a line goes through it now we may not want that we might want nothing to happen when we hover over that that special beyond it changing the color so we can set that to none and we can set the hover color to something else we could set something like yellow and if we hit refresh you'll see that that's taking place and you can't see yellow very clearly but you do see that the color is changing let's go ahead and make that orange just for the sake of argument so now you can see it's orange and if we want the default text to have an underline we could just set that text declaration underline and so now we know that it is a link and then when we hover over it the underlying goes away so that is how you manipulate the code for a hyperlink you can see all of that code right here on the screen and it's pretty straightforward you'll want to wrap this in a style and that's how you'll do it now you can go ahead and use an external CSS document which is a cascading style sheet but I will cover that in a future tutorial if you have questions about hyperlinks go ahead and leave those in the comment section below and I'll try and answer as many of your questions as I can if you have requests for future tutorials go ahead and leave those in the comment section and I'll try and create those tutorials for you in the near future so that I can help you guys out remember to share this with anybody you think will find it helpful because sharing is caring anyway like this video if you liked it don't forget to subscribe check out the other awesome content on the channel as always you guys thanks so much for watching and don't forget create something awesome today
