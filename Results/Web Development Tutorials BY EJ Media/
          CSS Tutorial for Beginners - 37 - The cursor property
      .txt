in this video we're going to go over the cursor property in CSS and I've listed out all the values here that you can use for the cursor property now the default is just that that is what the browser uses by default and you will recognize of course the very famous pointer and you will recognize the hand icon when you place the cursor over a link and you will recognize the text icon you get when you place the cursor over text but these can all be override it by the cursor property and that's what we're going to do so first let's over I the icon that gets displayed when you hover over a link and so we'll go down here to the hover rule set and you just type in cursor and let's pick crosshair let's try that so we'll just go ahead and save this will refresh our page and now we get a crosshair icon when we hover over our button now we can also change the icon when we hover over our main section and so let's put a cursor property up here and let's switch this to help so we'll go ahead and do that and let's do a save and refresh and now you see we get a Help icon with the pointer and you may want to use that if you have a Help section so you want to just let the user know that there over a Help section and so you get the idea you can use these different values now you can actually turn off the icon altogether and you just use the none value so let's do that down here let's switch this to none now take a look at this carefully I'll move this pointer up slowly and you will see the icon disappear and now I'm over the button and you see no icon so that's one way to remove icons if you don't want them displayed let's try the move value and now we get a moove icon and you may want to use this if you allow somebody to move an element I'll actually do a future video on how to do that if you allow somebody to move an element within your webpage and that gives them the sign to go ahead and do that okay that is going to do it for this video
