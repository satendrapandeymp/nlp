hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 27th retold in this course and in this tutorial we'll be continuing our discussion on forms and we're gonna check out some more form elements right so this is the form that we're going to prepare and we know how to have the first name field the last name field and the gender field in the last tutorial we built the form till here and the rest of the fields that you see one two three four five six and also the submit your form button here you know all these things how we're going to do that we're gonna check out in this tutorial so this is the HTML file and till line number 14 I'm sure you guys are familiar with the the the text in line number fourteen because this is something we covered in the last role when line number fifteen I have to break tags and then on line number sixteen I have the text arrow birth a colon and then the Select tag so this is going to result into this effect you know arrow birds there are five values people can choose from and there's this drop-down icon here if I click on it I'm presented with five values and I can choose one of the five so if I select 1991 then that will be displayed here if I select 1994 that'll be displayed and this is something that is used fairly often you must have seen it on several websites wherein you have to create your account on Facebook Gmail I'm sure you know all these places they ask you for your Arab birth and you know there is a list of I don't know you know 6070 years between 1960 and then 2010 or maybe you know 1930 1940 so it starts from there and to have each value in this select list you need to use option tag so let's first check out the parent tag here which is select right so you're not using the input tag here you use in the Select element you type and select and then obviously you have to give a name to this this field and I've given the name your and I have used the name attribute so just as we did with the input element I have used the name attribute with the Select element this time and I've given it the name your and then to have you know each value let like 90 90 or 91 92 93 and 94 you have to use the option tags right so you type an option between less than and greater than symbol and you have to give a value for each you know value that you've displayed in your list so here it's simple you know because it's a robot so you can give the same value to each each text value that's displayed in the Select list so for 1990 I have the value 1994 the first option then I have 91 for the second option 92 for the third and you see for the fourth and 94 for the fifth and you also have to close your option tag the traditional way by using / option after the text right so if you change the text here like if you change the text 90 92 95 then this text would appear in the drop-down list and you know if you let it be 90 90 here then even if someone selects 95 from the drop-down list the value that's actually going to be retrieved is 90 90 right I hope that makes some sense and then I have two more break tags on line number 23 and then on line number 24 I have another simple text box and this is similar to the first name or the last name field that we have in this form so choose a user name input tag and then the type for it is txt the name is user name I have two more break tags on line number 25 and then I've asked the user to choose a password so choose a password and then I've used the input tag again but this time the type for it is password it's not text so although it you know it is similar to the user name field or the first name or last name fields it is different in the sense that if you type in a username in the username field let's say I type in M IDs you are you can see the text but if you select your type for the input tag as password whatever text you type in you know you can't see the text you see bold you know whatever these hidden characters are right so this is a significance of using the password type for the input tag and then again you have to give a name to your field and I've given it the name password I've closed the tag and then two more break tags there on line number 28 I have you know the element text area and the significance of this is if you're asking for something that can be long like you know some people ask you to upload your resume a and some people also ask you to copy the text that you have in your CV and just paste it so you know CDs are generally long or if you're writing about your hobbies or you know what you're interested in or you know if you're just writing about yourself then you actually need larger areas to express yourself so in in those cases you use the text the you know what do you call text area element and between the opening and closing angular brackets you type in text area and of course you have to give a name to this field too so I've given it the name goals because I have asked for what are your goals in life that's the question and then you have to close this so you can immediately open it and close it and you know you can also drag it expand it and you know make it small or large and this is I guess a smaller size and you know you can make it as because you want you know for your convenience and the next field that I have is a field that has checkboxes so again you know I told you a bit about this in the last tutorial when we were talking about radio buttons I told you that using radio buttons you can sort of force that people select only one value for a field the beauty of using checkboxes is that you can select multiple values so let's say you the question here is how would you want to contact how would you want to be contacted you know how would you want us to contact you and there are three options here phone email SMS so let's say you want to be contacted through phone and SMS you can select these two and you cannot select email and on the other hand if you want to be contacted through all three then you can select email too and you can you know check any combination so the way you have this in your webpage is by using the type box with the input element so you type in input and then you give the type checkbox' you know the value check box to the type attribute and you have to use the same name as we you know did with the gender field here and the name for all the three values phone email and SMS is contact and the values are different so the value for phone is phone the value for email is email and the value for SMS is SMS right I hope this makes sense line number 34 I have two more break tags on line number 35 I have this button that you know will ask you to select the picture and you know it says choose a file so when I click on it you know I am presented with this so I can browse and I can select a picture that I want to upload or any file right so this is how you get it I first have the text upload your latest picture a colon and then I've used the input element again here but this time I've used the value file for the type attribute right so we've seen different values that you can give to the type attribute with the input element if used checkbox value we've used the radio value we've used a text value the password value and now we're checking out the file value here and again I have given a name to this field - I've given it the name image and you know this is we've seen how it looks like and then on line number 37 finally I have the submit button for the form and when you click on the submit button like right now I haven't use any programming language at the backend so you know the values are not going to database but usually you have some kind of programming interface that takes the values that users provide and stores the values in databases but right now I don't have any such thing going so the submit your form button is not going to do anything but if you have such provision then when you click on the submit your form button you know the values are sort of stored in the database and the way you have it in your webpage is by using the submit value for the type attribute with the input tank right so you type an input give the value submit to the type attribute and I've given the name submit to the field and the value is submit your form and this is what you will see on the button so if you'll change this text here if you'll change if you change it to you know just submit with an exclamation I'll save the file go to Google Chrome refresh it you will just see some right here right so that's it that's all about forms and I guess we've covered up pretty much everything about forms in the last tutorials this one in the last one that is and I hope you guys had fun and you may subscribe to my channel
