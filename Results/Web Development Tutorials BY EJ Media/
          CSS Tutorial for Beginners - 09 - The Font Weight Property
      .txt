welcome to the ninth video on beginning CSS today we're going to look at the font weight property in CSS and that allows you to control the thickness of your fonts so if you want lighter fonts you can use the lighter parameter or if you want bolder font so you can use the bold parameter and the property can make your fonts look more dynamic now I'm using the code that we used from the last video in the eighth video and I made four different copies of it so we'll make all the fonts on this HTML page lighter this one will be normal this one will be bold and this one will be bolder and those are the four parameters lighter normal bold and bolder so let's start out with lighter and what I did was I added the parameter right here so it's font - weight and then you just put in lighter now if we wanted it to be normal we would put normal here bold and the final one which is bolder now I've added normal obviously to this one bold to this one and bolder to this one so we don't need to look at those but what I wanted to be able to do is open each one of these HTML pages at the same time so you could see the difference in weight now we're going to add this to the body selector and that rule apply to our entire HTML body element so all the fonts in here will be affected and again that's through inherited something we've been talking about throughout the series so let's go ahead and close that and then I'll just show you this really quickly you can see here we've got the normal parameter and in this one we've got bold and in this one we've got bolder there we go so let's go ahead and open up lighter and now I'm going to minimize this because I actually want to flip through these and show you the difference and then we'll open up normal and I'm going to go ahead and minimize that and we'll open up bold and I'm going to go ahead and minimize that and then bolder and now I'm going to flip through these because it's easier to see the difference so if we open up light and so that's the lightest font weight and then now take a look at the difference here you can see how I got a little bit more bolder with the normal weight and if we go to the bold font weight the contrast gets even greater and then this is bolder okay so that's how that works with the font weight property
