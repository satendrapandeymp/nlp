welcome to the 28th CSS tutorial in this tutorial we're going to add a content page and we're going to use the existing CSS classes that we've created to style it so we really shouldn't have to do a lot of work and that's the beauty of CSS every new web page that we add to our site we can use a lot of our existing CSS that we've already created so let's go ahead and open up our website and we'll do that in chrome again and if we scroll down here let's add a section down here that will be additional links to other articles that we're going to create on fish so let's go ahead and do that and we'll open this up so we can look at the HTML and let's scroll down here and of course we need to make sure we put this in the body element and I've already typed this out but what we're going to do is add an h3 so we got another header and we're going to use the anchor tag and we've talked about that in previous videos of course and here's our new web page is going to be shark so we're going to refer to that shark HTML now I will put this code out on the message board so you don't have to type it all out in fact up with the code for index.html our shark dot HTML and our CSS style sheet so this link will open up our new shark HTML and this will be the text that people will see on the page that will say the largest shark ever so let's save this now what we're going to do is we're going to actually create some CSS rules for our header 3 element and so let's go ahead and do that to open up the style sheet and we'll just copy and paste what we have from our h1 now we don't want the font size increased on this so let's just get rid of that and we don't want to Center this let's actually have this header element situated on the left and if we take out this Center by default it will be moved to the left so let's go ahead and save this and actually we have to put h3 here and now we'll save this and let's open up our index.html and if we go down here you can see now that we've got our link the largest shark ever and again we wanted this all on the left so we're not centering any of these elements and I will click on this on a second now let's go to the shark dot HTML content page that we have them let's open that up in notepad and here you can see we're going to be reusing the same style sheet that we've been using so that's perfect we don't have to create a new style sheet and that's really the beauty of a style sheet all of your future web pages can reuse the same style sheet now you don't have to necessarily do that you can create separate style sheets and some people do that you could create a style sheet for each page but that kind of defeats the purpose in my opinion so we're going to reuse our div main class and we're going to reuse our paragraph our generic paragraph that we've been using and so let's go ahead and exit out of everything let's open up our index.html and now let's click on this link and there you can see we've got our content page and the beauty about this take a look everything styled like our home page and that's good because it's keeping the same look and feel so we didn't have to do a lot of work and again that is the beauty of CSS we are reusing our CSS paragraph class you will also notice that our body and our content page is also being formatted in the same way we have the same color the same margins everything that we put in our body so that again is the beauty of CSS okay let's close this out and let's open up our index.html now in the next video we are going to deal with special effects for the first time and we're actually going to create some effects when we hover over this link and you guys have probably seen that when you've been browsing around other websites so that's what we'll be doing in the next video and actually before we go I just thought of something else let's close this out and let's go back into our HTML for our shark content page and we don't want to use an ID we actually want to use a class here because this is going to be a generic class that will use a div class for the rest of our content pages so remember id is for a specific class that you want to use for a specific page so let's just put in class here instead and we'll call this div content and then let's go ahead and save this and let's go back to our style sheet and here you can see the pound signs and again that identifies IDs but we don't want to do that we want a class so we're just going to create a new div class below this and we'll put the period sign of course which identifies it as a class and we'll call this content and let's save this and if we go into our shark dot HTML and so everything looks great you know what we need a period there let's just be clean here and we'll just fix that real quick okay that will do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
