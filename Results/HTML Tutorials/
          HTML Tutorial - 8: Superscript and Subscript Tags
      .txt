hello guys welcome to my channel this is the eighth tutorial in this course when this tutorial will be checking out some more tags in HTML so I've got a document here and on line one in this file I have the doctype declaration and between the HTML opening and closing tags I have the head section which has the title strikethrough superscript and subscript tags between the opening and closing title tags and the body section I have three paragraphs again just as I had in the last tutorial with some more tags in between the opening and closing paragraph tags so I have the strike tag you know the opening strike tag and the closing strike tag between the opening and closing paragraph tags on line number seven and what feature will this result into I'm sure you are aware of the strike through style in Microsoft Word right so if you want some text and if you want that text to be striped out then you have to use a strike tag and you know I'll show you guys how the file looks in Google Chrome in just a moment let me talk about the other two tags that are new in this tutorial you know before showing you the file in Google Chrome so I have the super script tag on line number eight and we're meeting the start for the first time in this tutorial and you know if suppose you want to have an expression like three cube equals 27 right so three to the power three and you know I'm sure you guys know that when you have something in you know as a power of something you have it kind of elevated so you know it's superscript basically and to have that effect you use the su P tag so I have three the opening su P tag and then the closing su P tag in between these two I have another three right so one three will be at the base level another three will be at a slightly elevated level so you know this will result into the expression three cube equals 27 and then I also have those you know sub script tag used for the first time in the course on line number nine right so between the opening and closing paragraph tags I have a subscript a times B subscript B equals C subscript C right it's not unknown expression I've just created one so now let me show you guys how this file looks in Google Chrome this is how it look so the first you know paragraph has a text no kidding which is strike doubt and the second one has you know the expression three cube equals 27 and the last paragraph has the expression a subscript a times B subscript B equals C subscript C and you know subscript is actually like just a superscript is text elevated subscript is text you know like at a lower level right so I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready and I assume the next tutorial in which we'll discuss more features of HTML more tags and that's it take care and have fun
