hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss introduction to html5 structural element or html5 structural tags let's discuss step by step we know that HTML 4 has one of the most important generic container element that is div tag or div element the div tag is a block level generic container tag it is used to group set of block level elements or tags together to create a section on a page right we know that we use the div tag to divide body into various sections we have to use it only when no appropriate semantic element to be used is available div has no semantic meaning at all the only way to identify it differently is by using class or its ID attribute we know that different developers in different geographical locations will use different class values and I devalue hence html5 provides more consistent and semantically meaningful set of structural tags that we use in place of div tag they are header tag footer tag nav tag main tag article tag section tag and aside tag these tags are going to replace div tags in our HTML pages in specific places let's discuss one by one header tag header tag is used to wrap the header content most commonly appears at the top of a page like a logo tag line search prompt etc for example here in the previous video tutorial we have created two different layouts here we have two layouts and the source code for them we have here layout one source code is this layout two source code is this in this you can see we have here a div with an ID of header in html5 instead of using a div for creating headers they have given a semantic tag itself that we need to use to create headers first of all this is not a html5 document I need to convert it to html5 document by adding here at the top doctype doc type HTML then I add Lang equal to en and then I add here meta charset equal to utf-8 closed now layout one web page become html5 document here what we can do is we can replace this deal with the header tag opening header and Here I am going right closing header file save Budda browser and refresh can see that there is no problem similarly I can go to layout 2 here also we are using div ID header you can see instead of that I can use directly the header tag that is available now in html5 Here I am going to close the header file of course this file is also not html5 document let me replace this by using exclamation mark doctype HTML and then here I add attribute Lang equal to en and then in head section I am going to use meta cap set equal to utf-8 file save go to browser and refresh can see there is no problem very well very good I hope you guys have understood how you can use the header tag where you can use the header tag let's proceed further it's okay to use more than once a header tag in a page for example we can also use header tag to represent heading of an article or a section but header tag cannot be child of other header tag or photo tags what's the meaning of that meaning of that I am going to explain over here you can use you can create an article AR di CLE article opening tag closing article and article can have a header closing h EA de our header and it can have a section for detailed description about the header and then it can have a footer also closing footer for example you are writing an article on Taj Mahal then the header is going to have Taj Mahal and here you are going to give detailed description inside a section or you are going to write an article on Taj Mahal and it might have a footer also that means you can have a header tag to Indy a header of an article or a section I hope you guys are understanding let's proceed further but remember that header tag cannot be child of other header or footer tags header tag is not a sectioning element we talk about sectioning a little bit later next we proceed to the footer tag footer tag is used to wrap the footer content most commonly appears at the bottom of a page like copyright content other related links etc right for example in our layout also we have here at the bottom footer in this layout also we have putas at the bottom so let's use that Here I am going to replace this div with the footer tag footer opening and here I say closing footer file save go to browser and refresh you can see there is no problem similarly in the layout - also I am going to replace this div with the footer F double OT our footer and here I am going to replace this with footer file save for a browser and refresh very good let's proceed further it's okay to use more than once a footer tag in a page for example we can also use footer tag to represent footer of an article or a section you can see in this page I have used footer inside an article we can use footer inside an article or a section there is no problem in that footer tag can contain other sectioning elements inside the footer you can use a article or a section tag or a nav tag also but footer tag cannot be child of other header or a footer tag it's not a sectioning element hope you guys have understood when to use a footer tag in our HTML pages next tag we are going to discuss is the nav tag nav tag is used to wrap a section with a major navigation links of our current website it should wrap only the navigations of current website not navigation of some other websites present in our website normally you find links in footer also if you want you can use now for wrapping them too it's a sectioning element one of the thing you need to remember that if you have many links somewhere it is not necessary to use the nav tag now tag is used to wrap the Mae navigation links for example let's go to our layout here here we have navigation links these are major to our main website are for this profile website so I go to layout one you can see here we have created a div with an idea of nav instead of that I can replace it with the nav tag opening nav and here I'm going to close the nav file save for browser and refresh you can see that there is no problem it's working well similarly I go to layout - layout - also we have a navigation section created instead of that here I am going to use the nav tag opening nav and here I close the NAP file save good browser and refresh can see it's working properly I hope you guys have understood when to use a nav tag and how to use it next we have main tag main tag is placed between the header and footer to wrap the main content of the page it should not be child of an article aside header footer or new tags it should be it can be a child of a div tag so I go here you can see here we have the div tag this is going to be the wrapper there is no rapper called as tag in HTML 5 so we need to use div only with an idea of wrapper and then here you can see we have the main content area in layout 1 then instead of using this div I can use main tag ma I and main tag file save good browser layout 1 and refresh you can see that it's working properly similarly in layout 2 also we have the main content area that I am going to replace with the tag main opening and closing main tag I'm using instead of the generic div tag we are using specific tags file let me save this file file save go to browser and refresh you can see it's working properly I hope you guys are understanding what is the meaning of main tag and where to use and it's also a sectioning element next we proceed further to an article tag article tag is used to contain standalone content of a page that can be independently repost able anywhere else such as blog post any images videos form post comments magazine or newspaper articles interactive widgets etc can be wrapped inside the article tag it can be child of a section tag and it's a sectioning element in our web layouts we don't have any content which is repost able which is independently repost able you can use article tag for example if you have an article written as I told here a I have written an article on a Taj Mahal that article I can put are posted on any website which is related to history of the country or history of monuments I can post it anywhere independently in that situation we have to wrap such elements such content inside the article and if any widgets are there for example you have calculating the weather report and that visit you can repost it or in any website anywhere independently such things we put in article tab okay next we have section tag section tag is a thematic grouping of content with a heading of course if you have an article this article can be a section but as this article is related to Taj Mahal it is specific to Taj Mahal we have to use article only as that article can be reposted anywhere but sections are not reportable section tag is thematic grouping of the content with an heading that means in our web page if we have many sections we can use this section tag to divide our webpage into different sections section tag can be used to create section on the page but it's not generally container element like a div it has specific meaning it is not generic okay it can be used to create sections in an article for example if I have a article you can see in the article an article might have more sections section 1 it might have one more section here I can create one more section opening section losing section like that we can create any number of sections in an article we can use in that situations a section tag even to divide our webpage into different sections also we can use a section tag for example to represent chapters or tabbed pages news items all these things we can wrap into section tag in our webpage here we don't have any sections here also we don't have any sections so we can't use at present similarly we have a side attitude a side tag a side tag is used to wrap content that is related to the content around it for example sidebars adds groups of navigation elements content that is related not to main content can be placed in the asylum or you can say sub content of our web page can be placed inside aside for example in this layout we don't have any aside but when I come to layout - here we have a sidebar this is his sub content of our whole web page right I can put that here we have a div with an idea of a side with that we have used in some using a day of generative I can use a specific div that is a side opening aside and here I say closing a side file save go to browser and refresh you can see now we have properly used html5 elements structural elements instead of using a generic div tag this is how we can use the HTML structural elements I hope you guys have understood what I explained in this tutorial it's quite simple to understand and one of the important thing is it is developers decision that which tag to be used there might be some confusions you might have then as in when you proceed further you will understand when to use which tag it is all about experience based on the experience you get more better idea when to use which tag I hope I have clearly explained which tag to be used when I suggest you to try some examples by yourself for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep pouring keep sharing thank you very thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
