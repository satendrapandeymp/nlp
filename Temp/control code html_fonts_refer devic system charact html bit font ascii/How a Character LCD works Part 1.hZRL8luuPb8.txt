[Music] welcome to another episode of the 8-bit guy so in this episode I want to show you how character LCDs work now these things have been around since at least the 1980s you can find them in all kinds of electronics like old computers music keyboards synthesizers calculators early mobile phones laser printers and are still widely used today on servers and for Hobby projects with microcontrollers in fact they are ridiculously cheap now and you can find them all over eBay for just a few dollars and just about every shape size and color you could warrant they come in as small as 8 by 1 characters some other common sizes are 8 by 2 16 by 2 and 20 by 4 these screens should all have either fourteen or sixteen pins on them they can be arranged in different ways but they should be labeled 1 through 14 I'm going to start by showing you what each of the 14 pins do the first pin is ground the next pin is +5 volts so these two ours are essentially what gives the screen power the next 10 receives an analog voltage to set the contrast of the screen typically this is done by connecting it to the middle pin of a potentiometer then the other two leads on the potentiometer go to +5 volts and ground so the signal you're feeding it will always be somewhere in between those numbers depending upon where you turn the knob the next pin is register select so the screen can accept two types of information one is text data that's basically just putting ASCII characters on the screen the other option is instructions which tells the screen do stuff like turn the cursor on initialize the display create graphics characters things like that so imagine you had a toggle switch you could hook up this pin to the center of the switch and then connect 5 volts to one side and ground to the other that way when you move the switch back and forth it will pull the line high or pull the line load telling it which type of data you want to send it the next pin is for read/write yes besides just sending information to the screen you can actually read information from the screen and you have to pull it high for reading or low for writing the next pin is the enable pin I'll come back to this in just a minute the next eight pins are the data bits 0 through 7 which represent an 8-bit binary number all of these pins need to be set either high or low just like the last view so back to that enable line this is the final piece of the puzzle basically once you've set all of the other pins exactly how you want them then you set this line high and that will feed all the information into the screen also some screens have 16 pins and those are just to accommodate a backlight so that's just the power source for the backlight I've hooked these screens up to all sorts of things and I plan on showing you how to hook it up to a comb over 64 here shortly but before I do that it occurred to me did it might be possible to control these screens without using any sort of computer at all using nothing but toggle switches so I set out to construct such a device so I played around with my design here on a paint program and this is what I came up with obviously I'll connect these two pins to power and ground this one for contrast a toggle switch for the register select the read/write pin will go straight to ground because I'm not going to be reading anything I'm only going to be writing data and then I'm going to use a push button on the enable line and then of course 8 toggle switches for the data lines so I went to my local Fry's Electronics to pick up some toggle switches I could have gotten them a lot cheaper online but I didn't want to wait for shipping this single-pole double-throw ought to work fine I would also need a push button for the enable line so I picked this one so here's all the stuff I picked up I got this nice little project box to mount everything in [Music] I'm going to use this 16 by 2 LCD that I pulled out of an old ISDN modem years ago [Music] I'm just going to test fit the LCD string [Music] okay so here's all the switches mounted this reminds me of an old Altair computer only this will be a lot simpler so here's that potentiometer for the contrast control and here's the push-button [Music] I also have a nice little knob to fit on the contrast control I printed out some labels so that I could better see what you switch is for and here's what it looks like so far now it's time to start wiring up the inside so I'm just going to use a big piece of solid core wire and mounted across all of the leads of these switches [Music] now that those are all soldered on I can actually use these spaces in between to connect all of the other wires that need to connect to either 5 volts or ground I'm also going to need a power cable since USB is 5 volts I'm just going to cut the end off the this USB cable then I'm going to wire up a barrel jack to the end and of course I'll need a barrel jack on the back of the box so I'll install that too but I need a bunch of small wires of different colors I usually just take an old scrap multi-conductor cable like this one and strip it back and cut off a bunch of wires unfortunately when I started soldering wires to the LCD I noticed that one of the solder pads was missing and I couldn't solder to it so I've had these little screens around forever and I have D soldered and resolder to them probably dozens of times because I've used them in a lot of different projects just you know temporarily and that's an unfortunate side-effect of continually soldering and desoldering those little pads sometimes they can just pull right off however I do have another one just like it so I'll use that one instead but it does have some ribbon cable still attached to it so I'll need to desolder that so after I remove the ribbon cable and cleaned up the flux on the board I noticed that it was also missing not one but two solder pads so I simply won't be able to use those I do have another LCD but it's a smaller 8 by 2 character display and much too small for the hole I made so it looks like I'll have to use this larger 20 by 4 character display instead it will barely fit it does have a pin header soldered into it but after the bad luck I had with the other tube I'm just going to leave that in place and solder wires directly to the pins like this and once I'm done I'll run some heat shrink over the pins just to be on the safe side I think that's going to work out just fine so I've cut a larger hole in the box it's not as elegant as the first one because I had too much stuff in the way this time now all that's left is to connect up all these wires to the right switches there is one problem though the push-button switch only has two leads not three so there's no way to alternate a signal between high and low if you leave a pimp unattached it's called a floating pin bad because it can randomly pick up static in the air and alternate between high and low on its own so what I'll do is attach a resistor to ground that will keep it pulled low and then when I push the button it will overpower the resistor and pull the line high so let's try it out I've got a chart printed out to show me the binary digits for ASCII characters and a few sheets show me all the instructions for the screen but things didn't go exactly to plan all right so here's the deal so this is actually an OL thing to see when you fire up an LCD screens to have these little two lines kind of lit up the contrast does work however I couldn't get anything else to work until eventually I realized all my buttons are upside down my switches are upside down this is upside down and all these are upside down so I'm going to have to think about this for a moment so I want to turn on the display so I'm going to move to one on instructions so yeah it's actually going to be opposite of where I need and this should be the sequence to initialize the display and bam it works looks like we need to adjust the contrast a little bit so now we want to set the data path okay now let's see if we can send some data okay then one of the things you're probably going to notice is every time I push one of these I get more characters than I wanted to that's because of a bounce problem so let's talk about balance when you have two pieces of metal in a switch coming together now it may seem like they touch instantaneously but in reality they actually bounce just ever so slightly when they first touch now it's imperceptible to us humans but digital electronics are fast enough that they can actually see the bouncing to them it seems like you've pushed the button multiple times so what we need to do is solve that is add a capacitor to the switch that slows down the transfer of power because it takes a short delay for the capacitor to charge and discharge thus smoothing out the behavior of the switch so let's test it out again alright so we're going to try this again powered on there we go okay set the font and now let's try sending some characters okay it looks like our debounce is working we're sending characters without repeats now okay so this is the inside after everything is done now it's time to finally screw the bottom plate on I can't easily rotate my switches around but I can change the labels on here so that the register select is showing correctly unfortunately my data bits are still upside-down I'll put the contrast knob on now alright so I've ran out my name here so more interesting things that I'm going to show you is if you want to cursor around you're going to want to set to instruction mode and then zero zero zero one okay that should let me move the cursor to left and I can change direction by flipping this switch and I can move it back to the right however instead of moving the cursor I can actually move the entire screen but flick this would look at that and I can move it back the other direction so that's just some of the interesting things that you'll learn playing with this and you can see the contrast adjustment seems to pretty well so here's one final look at the device and here's what it looks like in the dark since this particular screen is backlit alright so I think this is a pretty cool little educational device just you know learning how to use the binary information and key it into the screen is is actually probably a really good learning tool for someone getting into digital electronics anyway I was going to show you how to connect this up to a Commodore 64 both on the cartridge port and on the user port however this video is getting a little long so I've decided to split that off into a part two so hopefully you'll stick around for that and and I hope this episode wasn't too technical or boring or anything like that because I kind of like to make a little bit more technical videos like this every now and then but you know I run the risk of going too deep and that might not work for some people so let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you next time [Music] [Applause] [Music]
