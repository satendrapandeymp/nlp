in this video we're going to go over the number input box so once again we are using the input element but this time we are setting the type to number and that will give us a number input box so let's go ahead and hit refresh here and there you can see we've got our number input box now what this web control does is it only allows the user to input numbers so no characters or anything like that you can only use numbers so we can enter a very very large number in here if we want then you'll also notice that this number input box has an up and down arrow so we can adjust it accordingly now what if you want to specify a range in terms of numbers that is you will only allow a certain range between a minimum number and a maximum number that can be inputted into this field and that's where the minimum and maximum attributes come into play so we'll go back over here to our HTML and I'll just copy and paste this in here so again we're using the minimum attribute and the maximum attribute and we're going to set this to zero and we're going to set this to 20 well let's bump that up a little bit let's set that to 50 so the only number is now that the user can enter our a number between zero and fifty that's all that will be allowed so let's save here now you'll notice when I hit refresh this box will get much smaller because we're only allowing up to 50 to be entered so I'll hit refresh in there you can see we have a much smaller box and if we start using our up arrow here you'll see that we're going and we're going and we're going and if we get to 50 it stops we can't put in anything else okay so that's the number input box I will see you guys in the next video
