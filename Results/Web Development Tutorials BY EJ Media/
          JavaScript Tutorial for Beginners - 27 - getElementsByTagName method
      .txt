in this javascript tutorial we're going to go over the get elements by tag method and of course in the last video we are looking at the get element by ID method and what did we do well we just grab this paraone ID and then we started manipulating the text but in this tutorial as I said we're actually going to grab the tag instead of the ID we are grabbing the tag the elements tag which in this case is the paragraph tag and you'll notice that the method name get elements by tag is in the plural the elements is in the plural so we're grabbing all of these tags so this is a very powerful method because it allows us to grab all the tags at once and manipulate the text we can't do that with the ID attribute because it is too specific but with the get elements by tag method we can grab all of these paragraph element tags and for that matter we can grab any tag we want in our webpage so if it was a development we could grab the body tag you can grab any tag that you want on your web page and manipulate it with this method now you might ask the question well if we're not using this unique ID anymore how do I know which paragraph tag is which in other words let's say you just wanted to manipulate this second paragraph tag right here how do we know that well the get elements by tag method builds a node list this is similar to a raise you'll remember we had those indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on same concept here this node list so the first paragraph element has a node list index of 0 the second one would be 1 the third would have an index of 2 and so on and so that's how you can specify an individual tag and we'll actually do that when we write some JavaScript code which we're going to do in a few seconds now you'll notice that this is pretty similar to the last video in terms of our HTML we've got a button and when we click it we're going to change some of this text and we're going to use the same function which was this change style function so let's go over to our JavaScript code and it's empty right now I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste the first section in here and explain it so of course remember always the first thing we need to do is to grab the element in our webpage in this case we're going to be grabbing the paragraph tag like I said again this means we're grabbing all of the paragraph tags in our webpage and keep in mind you always put the tag you specify the tag that you want and you surround it by quotes so you can see right there surrounded by quotes and again you could put a div you could use any tag that you want so when we grab all of those paragraph tags and that node list is built it's all stored in our paragraph variable now let's switch back to our web page for a minute let's go ahead and we're going to write some code that will work against this second paragraph element tag and I'll copy and paste the code in here now and so we're creating a new variable and it's appropriately named change paratext notice we are using the one that's the index that's where this index comes into place so we specified our variable up here and then we just put in the index of the tag that we want to update so if we flip back to our web page this is going to be 1 this would be 0 if we wanted to update the first paragraph tag we would put 0 there but we want to change the second so we're going to put in a 1 that's where that one comes into play and then the rest of this you'll recognize this is very similar to the last video we're going to use the style object and we're just going to change the fonts to italic and so again very similar to what we did in the last video and you can go ahead and use some of those other properties from the last video that we were changing if you want to you don't have to use italic that's what we're just using for this video so let's go ahead and run this now and so we'll go ahead and run this in chrome and if we hit submit you'll notice it did exactly what we wanted it changed the second paragraph elements text to italic now let's actually change everything to italic so let's go ahead and do some copy and pasting here we'll update all four paragraph element tags and what we're going to do is we're going to switch this to 0 we're going to switch this to 2 and we're going to switch this to 3 and so this will cover all the paragraph tags in our node list from beginning to end and so if we save everything up and we'll go ahead and run this and we hit our submit button all the text in our four paragraphs are now changed to italics and so you can see this is a very very powerful method you can pull all of the tags in your web page and do mass changes now you might ask the question well if we're changing all four of these paragraphs to italic why do I have to reproduce this line four times and the answer is you don't actually have to do it this way you can create a loop where we only have to write one or two lines of code and it will loop through all of our nodes and do a mass change so we have to create a loop to do that and we're actually going to do that in the next video and so we'll create a loop in the next video to loop through all of our paragraph tags and make a mass change see you guys in the next video
