hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 29 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about some semantic tags for your website layout so I might have mentioned some of these tags in previous videos but I didn't really explain all too well what they do now something else that I've done over the past couple of tutorials as I showed you whenever you want to create a block on your website you can use a div tag or a division right now div tags are great but the problem is that they aren't semantic they don't explain what information goes inside of them right so this is was very confusing before the days of HTML 5 people would throw a gift tags pretty much everywhere and then you don't know if this div tag is meant to be a header if it's meant to be a footer if it's meant to be a side section of your website or something like that so yeah using a div tag you know people would go around using div tags when well pretty much everywhere but it just didn't explain what was inside of it so instead of just using div tags in html5 the guys who created the language decided hey let's give web developers a bunch of tags that are probably going to be a lot more semantic carry a lot more meaning and they gave us a few of these extra tags which I'm going to show to you guys now and instead of typing in them in here let me just show them to you in an image real quick so I created a layout here and basically if you take a look at one of these images you'll understand why we have these tags right so the first tag is the header tank and the reason why we have that is because we often have headers on a website if you take a look at any website in the world it's more than likely has a header so it made sense to have a new tag as a header tag then pretty much every single website in the world again has a navigation so it made sense to give us a tagged and sometimes the nav is in the heading of our website but that isn't always the case sometimes the nav moves to be in the side section of our website and sometimes we don't even have a side section so in that case the nav is up here in the top but there's no sign tag or yeah we don't need the assign tag right but obviously it made sense to have header and navigating with a footer so yeah like all of these layouts I have a footer in well in all of these layouts so yeah it made sense to have a footer tag in HTML 5 and then looking at the rest of these tags we have a section I have an article so articles are maybe more for blog based websites or news based websites where I sections are you know just bunch of sections on a website you can have more than one section you more than likely will have more than one section on your website and then we have a sides right so an aside is just maybe a sidebar on your website and again like I said not everybody has a side section on the website so sometimes you have a website layout that looks a little bit more like this and sometimes you have a website layout that looks a little bit more like this where you do have the sidebar so let's take a look at a real world example real quick like YouTube so I'm on my youtube channel right now and pretty much everywhere across YouTube we have this header bar and the header bar has a navigation in it obvious and navigation comes to the side we do have a navigation in the side or in our header balm that little button right we've also got our logo we've got our search and a bunch of other things so that's pretty much what goes in your header bar right then in the top of the site you can see we've got a block that goes pretty much all the way across the top of the site and it has an image it has a bunch of links so kind of like another navigation and stuff but this over here we'd call a section right so that's one section of our website then looking below that we've got an section with video so again that's another section I hate those birds okay so yeah looking below that we have another section then we have an aside so that aside is next to our main section in fact we've got three blocks in our aside but I mean you can just call this one side section or n aside right then below that we also have a footer right so this is kind of like the way you need to start looking at websites as well if you want to develop websites is just like looking at it and going ok that's the foot this is a section this is an aside this is another section that's the header and if you look at pretty much any web site in the world if you look at Facebook if you look at Twitter I mean let's open up Google real quick because that's not going to give away my personal information harness Facebook and Twitter might all right so if you look at Google real quick I mean you could call this a header that is a footer and this is a main section so very very simple layout I mean is not much on this page but if you search for something like I don't know drones I just got a drone so I'm quite interested in drones right so now we have you know a logo in the header we folks are search in the header and all the stuff you can say this is a header and inside of that header we also have a navigation so you can see that nav over here then we've got our section which has a bunch of different entries in that section so these might all be an article right and then if you scroll down we also have a footer so Google even follows that main layout and sometimes depending on what you google like maybe you Google as celebrity I don't know if I can think of one right now PewDiePie right if you google a celebrity usually you have a little side section over here as well so yeah Google also follows that layout of header section aside and so on and that's just how you have to start can add websites so let's take a look at all of these tags so the header tag is header again the body be sorry the nav tag is nav and sometimes that goes actually inside of the header like I said then we also have the aside and usually before the aside we have our main section and inside of our main section we might have an article or the article could be below the section depending on how you want to lay out your website and then right at the bottom of the website just before the closing tag of our footer we usually have for the closing tag of our body by the way we usually have a footer right so now I'm gone ahead and placed all these tags within the body of our website and now that this video was just to introduce you to all of these tags and explain why we have them in the next videos we are going to be taking a look at creating a basic website layout using these tags and it's not going to be like creating a website from start to finish that is going to be a completely separate tutorial series on its own and that tutorial series is coming I know a lot of people ask for it I will make one like that but for now we're just going to make a basic website layout something like one of the images that I showed you guys I don't know if we still have one of these open just a basic website layout like this see you guys get an idea of how to layout your website and I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I
