hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series in the previous tutorial we understood how do we convert a given WordPad document to a HTML page we understood how we can use HTML tags to convert any document to a web page in the previous tutorial we have written this code for converting that WordPad document to HTML page I suggest my students not to write the code something like this this is more cumbersome it is very difficult to understand by seeing this I can I can't be able to say so many things like I can't be able to say okay this is the opening font tag I want to know its respective closing font tag where is the closing font tag for this then I need to search here somewhere okay here is the closing font tag but this is not a closing font tag for this opening font tag actually this is a closing font tag for this opening font tab so I need to take time to understand where is the opening tag where is the closing respective tag it is very difficult also it is very difficult to tell which tag is within which tag which tag is the child of another tag which tag is the parent tag for other child tags it's very difficult as and when our code becomes more and more our HTML content becomes more and more it is very difficult to manage the HTML code itself so I suggest students to indent the tags in a proper way so that it is easy to understand your source code should be easily understandable to yourself as well as to others because you people might be working in a team the other person should understand your code very easily so I am going to align and indent properly so that this content or the code can be easily understandable let's begin first the root tag is a HTML tag and it is not indent you can see no problem we know that hTML is divided into two sections head section and the body section head and body are indented one level forward you can see that head is indented body is also indebted good title tag should go inside the head tag instead of putting this title tag here it is better to put it two indents inside right by seeing that I can very easily say okay title tag is the child of the head tag also I can say title tag is within the head tag it should be easily understandable similarly let's proceed further here we have a body in this we have a font tag is the next level right I am going to indent this font add three level forward one two okay two is enough not three so two level forward I have moved it similarly this is a closing font tag okay respective font tag for this opening font tag i indented two steps forward good inside this font tag only we have all the content actually because this whole content is affected by this font tag right this whole content is displayed in a Arial font right so I need to move this whole content inwards so I need to indent it three levels forward what I do I move this content I indented three level forward one two three similarly I indent this also one two three here we have paragraphs right one paragraph I have one more paragraph I have one more paragraph and we know that h1 h3 paragraphs are all in one level so what I do I move this paragraph here I hit enter and then I I have a closing paragraph here so I hit enter and I move this closing paragraph tag one two three levels forward h3 I move three levels forward similarly this open paragraph tag I move three levels forward hit enter for this paragraph I have a closing P tag over here so I indented one two three similarly I indent this hatch three three level forward similarly one two three I'm just using the tab key to indent okay I am pressing the tab key hit enter I have a closing P tag over here one two three so three times I hit the tab key to move this P tag from here to here by seeing this it is very easy to understand now right it's very easy to understand the paragraph tag opening is here closing is here paragraph tag opening is here closing is here for this paragraph opening tag is over here and the closing tag is over here this gives more sense for a person to understand the code okay I can make still more indentations in this one maybe I have a opening font tag and a closing font tag for this font is here so I can move this one two three four and this one I hit enter one two three four and I move this content inside you can very easily say what is happening now similarly same thing I can do for this one two three four hit enter one two three four similarly same thing for this one two three four hit enter I hit enter one two three four okay now we have indented and aligned our HTML code easily and we can understand also this content let me tell you how it works this content that you see here is the child of this font tag so definitely the color is going to be a gray color okay then this content is going to be within the paragraph tag so this content is also justified gray color justified and this content is within this font tag so definitely it will be having the font:arial so this content is arial plus gray color plus justified file save go to browser and refresh there will be no change you can see that you can see also this content is now in gray color justified as well as a font:arial by seeing the HTML code itself a person can be able to understand any person can be able to understand what your HTML code means I hope you guys have understood what is the importance of indenting and aligning or formatting your HTML code itself and how it will be helpful to understand what is happening behind the scene I can very easily see I can I can say so much about anything now maybe if I want to say something about this something about this structure okay if you see this structure content is within the you tag that means the structure is underlined and this you is actually within the I tag so here we have the I tag opening I tag closing I tag so this structure is going to be underlined as well as italicized if you want you can still align an indent properly this content also so that you can very easily explain the things and of course this structure is within this font tag so definitely it is going to be displayed in a gray color justified as well as of Arial color so those many things are affecting to this structure to display this structure these many tags are working on that hope you guys have understood what I am explaining for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get some more information on HTML for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
