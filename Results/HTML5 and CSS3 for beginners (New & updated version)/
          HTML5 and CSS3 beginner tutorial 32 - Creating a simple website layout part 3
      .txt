hey YouTube how's it going it's Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 32 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to add a sidebar to your website layout and also how to add a footer to the bottom of your website and once we've done that our website layout is pretty much complete and yeah let's jump straight into it so I'm going to hit refresh in the browser oops maybe I need to save these files okay so I just need to save my files over here I've gone ahead and cleared out the code that would make the slide boss and now that's all gone and the footer as well that's gone and let's take a look at how to add that stuff back in again right so go over my index file and the first thing I want to do is go to the footer and I want to add a class here of TM - footer taking care of the foot is just the easiest part right so what I want to do is just add a little bit of text here so I'm going to type and copy and basically if you type this little piece of code what that does is create a copyright symbol so this is the HTML notation a lot of special characters in HTML have something called HTML notation or HTML safe characters basically so you want to make a copyright symbol you can do something like that if you want to add like a dollar sign or an ampersand sign there are also shortcuts for that so something like this will make an ampersand sign but yeah let's not get too focused on that let's continue and add in the rest of our content here so I'm going to say copyright 2017 that's generally the kind of thing you would put in your footer the copyright for your website and you might also put in like some people like to make columns in the footer with like links and everything but I think that's something we can do in future when you're comfortable with actually building websites although a copyright for now is simple enough so let's come back over the browser hit refresh and you can see we do have the copyright showing up it's just all the way down here in the bottom corner of the browser that doesn't really look very good so let's style this up a little bit so what I want to do is take this class of TM footer jump back over to my CSS and let's select that class and give it some styling so I want to make it look a little bit similar to the heading or the header over here with just a white background and centered text so I'm just going to give it a background of white and we can say text-align:center and for the last thing I just want to add a little bit of padding will say padding 20 pixels and that's just going to create a little bit of space so it's not like pushed up right against the bottom of the browser let's hit refresh and now you can see we've got a little bit of space underneath the copyright we've got our copyright info of them technically you might actually want to say copyright and then whoever the this belongs to so in this case it belongs to me or copyright your website 2017 whatever the year is right so let's save that now that's probably a better-looking copyright okay but it really matters what's there but yeah now the footer has been completed now let's take a look at adding in a sidebar onto the side of our website now this is going to be a little bit tricky because I'm going to have to change some HTML that I previously created but again if you're struggling to get this right you can download the code on patreon it's one dollar and while you can contribute one dollar for me to me for a month and then just download anything all of the code from all of the tutorials right so let's take a look at the side section over here and what I'd like to do is place in some content within the side tag so I'm going to give this a side tag a cloth of p.m. - sidebar because this is going to be our sidebar and I'm going to create a little div inside of this with a heading 3 and I'm just going to type other I'll let's say more stories so typically if you're creating like a blog website you might have a sidebar on your website with links to some of the other blog articles and that's exactly what I'm creating here with this little div so other stories I'm just going to create a unordered list with some list items and technically I should actually link these as well but I'm going to link that to hash I'm going to add Story one and then we can just copy paste this a couple times so story two and three and that should kind of be enough text for the sidebar the only problem is as you can see our sidebars all the way down here at the bottom of the website it's not displaying next to the website so now we need to go ahead and basically make it display on the side there so we need to adjust some styling and in fact we need to change a little bit of HTML so basically right now we have this div called TM content or it's got a class of TM content but that goes all the way around our sidebar and basically what I want to do is have the content to the left oh yeah for the left and the sidebar to the right so that means that kind of need to get the sidewalk outside of the content div so instead what I'm going to do is take that cloth out and then I'm going to create another div underneath this so create a div there and I'm going to give this give that same gloss of TM content let's just remove that closing div and then everything from this section down to the closing tag of our article I'm just going to indent that one line and then end off my div so basically now article and our section are all inside TM content and then our a side is outside of the content but everything is still within the container so if we save this now and refresh not much has changed just yet you can see the article basically just for the sidebar just kind of bumped down a little bit but what I'd like to do now is float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right so we can select our TM content class which we already have a class set up to this or a selector set up for this and I'm going to set a max width of 70% so the reason why I do that is because now when i refresh the maximum with our section or our content is going to take up is 70% which means we've got a nice big bit of space here for our sidebar and what I'd like to do now is select that sidebar by creating another class of year so let's select TM - sidebar what did I call it I did give it a class name so TM sidebar so let's copy that and just tape it here just make sure right and I'm going to give this a max width of let's say 25% and the reason why is because I want to have some space between the content and the sidebar so 25% and what I'd like to do is also select any content within the sidebar or any div within the sidebar and turn that white so background hashtag FFF and padding 30 pixels all right so the reason why I'm doing this is basically to turn this div white so that it actually has a background color all right so let's come back here and refresh and now I've got a white div at the bottom but we need to kind of float this over to the left-hand side so to do that we've already given it a max width of 25% and we've got the TM content you have 70% max width and so now I can add float left to float the content to the left and then on the sidebar we can say float right to float that content to the right now let's refresh and you can see we've got our content to the left and our links are appearing to the right but then we've also got a little problem and how with the foot kind of pushing up to fit in this empty little space and that's because whenever you have something floated to the left and something floated to the right and then you want content to appear below that you always have to clear the content so what we could do is select the footer' class and I can just say clear:both and that's an easy way of just getting the foot of below all the content again so now it's down here and that's just because the footer happens to be underneath 3d to things that we floated but what I'd rather do is use something called a clear fix which we've actually already taken a look at in what two videos ago so let me just remove that clear:both and where is it th PM header this little fancy trick that I used to clear our our menu items at the top of our page we're going to use that same trick again so I'm just going to copy paste this and I pull this all the way down to the bottom over here somewhere and I want to create a class called clear fix and yeah basically the exact same code so we could probably use this on our menu as well and I'm just going to copy that class paste that class on the container class as well so just add in a space so that it applies as two different classes save this now hit refresh ah okay something weird happened there so it should it should actually apply did I save this ah okay I don't think I saved my CSS file that was the problem right so yeah now if we scroll down the footer is cleared at the bottom of the site and we've still got a little problem here with our sidebar kind of not having any space above it and also kind of not taking up the correct amount of width that I'd like it to so let's go over to the sidebar selector here a sidebar cloth and I'm going to add in a width of 25 pixels as well now the reason why max would kind of didn't cover that is because whenever you float something to the left or to the right it just takes up the basically the minimum amount of space it can so right now this div I mean it's not very big because Story 1 is like this building right it's only that that little tiny little space so it's just taking up the smallest amount of space it possibly can but if I set proper width of 25% then it means that the smallest which it should be is 25% of whatever the parent is and then we also have a max width so he has basically just saying that make sure you don't get any bigger than 25% so if I add things like padding or margins these can add extra like width that might not be covered in width it's a very confusing thing but like if you read up about it or the more you play around with it and the more you use this you'll kind of realize when you add padding to a div and then float it to the left or float it to the right it contributes to to the actual width so in fact your width is 25% plus your padding plus so on I could probably think of a better example to explain this but for now yeah just realize that I'm using both of those because I don't want to be more than 25% with all right so let's come back here refresh so now the width is looking a little bit better but we still have a margin issue so sidebar we can basically just do the same thing we did for TM content and take those two margins of margin top 30 pixels margin bottom 30 pixels save that refresh and now we've got the spacing set up a little bit more correctly and yeah now we have a slide bar and we have a footer and our website pretty much looks like a website for now so that is all I have for you guys in this video and I'll see you guys next time I just want to spend a shout to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their websites the link is in the description below and if
