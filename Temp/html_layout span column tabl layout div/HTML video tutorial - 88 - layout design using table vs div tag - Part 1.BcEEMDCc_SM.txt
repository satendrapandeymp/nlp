hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorials we have learned how CSS float property and CSS clear property behave when we layout HTML elements from this tutorial onwards for the next few tutorials we are going to discuss layout a design or web page layout or design using table versus using div elements so let's get started I go to start type notepad I click on notepad here I am going right opening his tml closing HTML tag opening head tag closing head tag opening body tag closing body tag in the head section I am going to write title here I say layout design using table closing title file save as I save the file with the name layout using table dot HTML both sides I put double quotation save the file at desktop I click on Save button you can see that layout using table dot HTML page god-created I minimize this I right click on layout using HTML page open with the Firefox you can see that layout using table dot HTML page got open and title is said to layout design using table I minimize it I open the notepad once again here I say layout using div file save as I give the file name as layout using div dot HTML both sides I put double quotation I save the file at desktop I click on Save button you can see that layout using div dot HTML page god-created I minimize this I right click on layout using div dot HTML page open with the Firefox you can see that layout using div dot HTML page got open title is set to layout design using div I minimize this I close this file I right click on layout using table dot HTML page open with the notepad I minimize it I right click on layout using div dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize first I go to layout using table dot HTML page in that I cream a table opening table tag and closing table tag table tag is a pair tag and it's a block level tag we know that in the table we are going to have one table row so closing TR in the TR we are going to have one TD opening TD and this is going to be main container cont AI NER main container closing TD this table is going to become a main container for our whole web page layout so I am going to give the ID to it this is going to be main container then we know that table has few attributes like width it is going to have 100% and it is going to have border of one pixel also I said sell SP AC ing cellspacing 0 pixels that's our table file save go to browser and open layout design using table dot HTML page i refresh the page you can see that it is displaying main container it should have a border around but it is not showing a border here I have missed the double quotation file save go to browser and refresh you can see that table got displayed with the border and it has occupied the entire width of the browser window quite simple same thing we can perform using the div also so I go to layout using div dot HTML page in this I am going to write the code so here I am going to write opening div tag and a closing div tag we know that div is a pair tag and it is also block level tag this div is going to become a main container for our whole HTML web page layout so I give the ID as main container double quotations it is going to have a content main container then I am going to apply some styles on this div div has no attributes like weld border like that we have to use CSS Styles only so I am using inline style I right here style equal to in double quotations I am going to save width : 100 % semicolon then I go down here I say it is going to have a border of 1 pixel solid line should have a black color maybe I give two pixels tab file save go to browser I click on layout design using div day I refreshed the page you can see that we have a development displayed it has occupied the entire browser width and it has border also you can see that if you observe both of them they are quite similar to each other in history ml whatever you can do using the table you can perform by using the Deval so one of the important thing you need to remember is while creating layout designs divs are more flexible than tables so it is recommended to use div element to create layout of web pages than tables for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information or we build the complete web page layout step by step for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to Like comment and share with everyone so that everybody will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much
