hey YouTube how's it goin it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 44 in this tutorial series and this is going to be the final video in the series so yeah if you have been following from video one until now you have successfully gone from somebody who didn't have anything about HTML to learning what a tag is to learning what CSS is and how to link CSS to your HTML page and how to style certain elements we've also taken a look at tables and more recently we took a look at forms so you have gone from an absolute novice to a sort of mediocre user or mediocre level of HTML and yeah congratulations I hope to see you guys working on some more projects in future the only way to get better is to obviously keep creating and keep learning so one thing I want to mention is that if you guys have created a website using what you have learned in this tutorial series and you want to push that live and you want to put it on a server where everybody can see it I do have another tutorial series on my youtube channel so if you go over my YouTube channel and then click on this little search icon over here that'll allow you to search through every single video that I have on my channel and you want to search for cPanel right and my cPanel series will show you how to purchase hosting and then how to upload your files to a server so it'll basically show you how to make your whole website that you built using this tutorial series live and push it on to a server where everybody can see it then something else I want to talk about is because we've recently spoken about forms one of the things that I mentioned when we started talking about forms is that HTML forms are kind of useless if you only know HTML you kind of need to know a little bit more than HTML to really make use of a form so you need to know at least the server-side language like minimal you need to know a server-side language like PHP or another server-side language I use PHP and I have PHP tutorials on my channel so if you go over to the search icon again and just search for PHP you can learn how to manage data in a forum with my PHP series and if I ever update the series of I ever add more PHP videos those will appear here as well now something else that might help make your forms a little bit more interactive and something that might help you get into the mind of actually programming is to learn a little bit of JavaScript so if you go to my channel and search for JavaScript I do have tutorials on this as well and any new tutorials I create should also appear here after I have uploaded them so yeah if you guys want to learn some JavaScript go ahead and learn some of that and that is basically what I wanted to get through in this video is just you know you have learnt or you have gone from an absolute novice level to a sort of mediocre level in HTML now you need to learn a little bit of server-side or a little bit of a scripting language to go further if you want to be a programmer and if you want to be a website designer then you want to learn how to create a website so that is something that I will be doing in a future tutorial series and yeah if you guys have stuck around from video one I just want to congratulate you for making it through to the end I also want to thank you for your patience because I have taken some time to upload this video series and just before I end off this tutorial series I just want to talk to you guys about my sponsored Day of mountain so go ahead and look at the link in the video description below and that will take you over to the website dev Mountain is a coding bootcamp so if you guys want to learn a little bit more about programming and you want to learn a little bit more about how this works and you're struggling to teach yourself then you can go ahead and check out their courses because if I scroll down over here they have courses on web development iOS development and UX design and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field within 12 weeks I believe so here it is 12-week immersive programs and yes they are based in these four locations Provo Dallas Phoenix and Salt Lake City but if you are not based in one of those like Asians they do offer free housing at every location for everybody who is a full-time student so if you really want to speed up the process in becoming a web developer or a UX designer go ahead and check out their website and maybe inquire about a course if you do in quiet don't forget to tell them that I sent you and that is all I have for you in this video so I'll see you next time special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that what you still hear there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
