this is part 10 of bootstrap tutorial in this video well disk is working with paragraph elements and inline text first let's look at the global bootstrap defaults that are applied to the body element and all paragraph elements here are the defaults font sizes 14 pixels line height is 1.4 to 8 let's confirm this let's flip to visual studio notice here we have this word hello bootstrap inside a paragraph element let's view this page in the browser now let's confirm this paragraph element is using the bootstrap defaults to do this I'm going to right click on this word and then select inspect from the context menu this is going to launch the Google Chrome developer tools and notice here we have styles as we scroll down notice the font size is 14 pixels and line height is 1.4 to 8 now let's discuss bootstrap inline text elements to underline text use the U element to strike through as highlight mark emphasize or italicize e/m bold strong subscript SUV and to superscript SUV let's look at a few examples notice here we've got a few paragraph elements and within the paragraph elements we are also using the inline text elements and here is the output notice the text that is surrounded by you element is underlined the text that is surrounded by s element is striking through so on and so forth I have this exact same HTML already typed within visual studio so let's uncomment this and let's reload this page let's first close the browser developer tools now notice we get the output that we expect also notice there is a horizontal line here because we are using the HR tag right here and the reason for this red color is within our custom Styles dot CSS I have overridden the border color to one pixel solid red now let's discuss the text alignment classes made a by bootstrap the left align text use text left to Center align use text Center to right align text right to justify text justify to not allow wrapping of words on to a new line use text no wrap here are the examples notice along with the paragraph elements we're also using the bootstrap text alignment classes and here is the output I have this exact same HTML already type in Visual Studio so I'm going to uncomment this code and reload our page notice the paragraph that has text left class applied its left aligned the paragraph that has text center applied it is Center aligned and the paragraph that has text right applied is right aligned and this is the paragraph on which we have text justify class applied to see the text to justification in action I'm going to resize the browser notice the first three lines within this paragraph are properly justified and this is the paragraph on which we have text nowrap class applied and because we applied the class it's not a loving wrapping of words on to a new line instead they continue in the same line and because of that we get this horizontal scroll bar now let's discuss bootstrap transformation classes here are the bootstrap transformation classes to convert letters to lowercase use text lowercase class to convert them to uppercase use text uppercase to capitalize first letter of every word use text capitalized class here are the examples notice along with the paragraph elements by using bootstrap transformation classes as well and here is the output let's look at this in action I'm going to uncomment the code that I have typed within Visual Studio and reload this page notice texts lowercase paragraph converts all the letters to lowercase text uppercase paragraph converts all the letters to uppercase text capitalized paragraph converts the first letter in every word to a capital letter let's now discuss lead class in bootstrap if you got more than one paragraph and if you want a specific paragraph to stand out from the rest of the paragraphs on that paragraph you can use the lead class let's look at an example notice here we've got two paragraphs on the first paragraph they're using the lead class this is going to make that first paragraph stand out from the second paragraph let's look at this in action let's uncomment this HTML and reload our page notice the first paragraph stands out from the second paragraph because on the first paragraph we're using the lead class let's now discuss how to work with abbreviations to create abbreviations use abbr element abbreviations with a title attribute displays a dotted underline when the mouse is over the abbreviation the pointer becomes a help cursor as you can see here and the title attribute value is displayed as a tooltip let's look at this in action so I have an abbr element right here and it also has got a title attribute title attribute value is set to British Broadcasting Corporation and the abbreviation is BBC let's save our changes and reload this page notice the abbreviation is displayed here with a dotted line when I move the mouse over that abbreviation look at that we see a help cursor and we see the title attribute value as a tooltip now if you want this abbreviation to have a slightly smaller font size than apply initialism class on that abbreviation so let's apply the initialism class save our changes and look at this when I reload this page the font size will be slightly smaller thank you for listening and have a great day
