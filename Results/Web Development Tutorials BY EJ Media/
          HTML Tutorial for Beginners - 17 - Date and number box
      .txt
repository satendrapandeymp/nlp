in the past several videos we've looked at the input element and we've looked at the different types we've created checkboxes submit buttons radio buttons text boxes and there are other types and that's what we're going to cover in this video now there is also a date type and a number type and we'll cover both of these in this video now as you can see here I've entered some text and what we're going to do is create a page where a user can enter the date that they want to travel to Cancun and so what the date type allows us to do is basically pick a date it'll give us a box in our browser that will allow the user to do that and so here's the first input element and all we do for the type is put in date and that will give us the box that will allow the user to pick a date and then we can put whatever we want in here let's just put in day now remember this is a value we'll deal with later on in PHP or ASP so we're not worried about this for now we're just concerned about this type which is date now I also put in some text here that will specify the number of days that they want to stay in Cancun and you guessed it the input type is number so we just put the number in here and that will give us an input field for numbers and again this involves the PHP and ASP scripts but let's just put in num days for a number of days and then we're very concerned with these two next values this will give us a minimum number and a max number that the user can enter into the number box so we'll just start out with a minimum number of one and we'll set a maximum of ten so our travel agency will only allow them to stay there for 10 days if they want to say they're longer they're going to have to seek other arrangements so again these are two values that that you can use for the number type so let's go ahead and save this and let's refresh our page and there you can see we have our date box and we have our number box so and you can go ahead and here and now and enter some day so let's just use this down and up arrow to do that and we'll first set the month let's set it to January we'll set the day to the third and then you can set whatever year it is you want to set now let's check the number box and you'll notice that we start out with 1 when we hit the up arrow and then we go all the way up to 10 we can't go any farther than that now this won't prevent us from entering in a number that we want to even though that's not a number that we aloud in our HTML we would have to stop this with JavaScript and we'll talk about that in the JavaScript series so the minimum and maximum values that we set in the HTML only have to do with the up and down arrow keys in the browser if you click into the box itself you can enter whatever number you want and again we have to use JavaScript to prevent that if we want to okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
