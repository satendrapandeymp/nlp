so today we're going to build a web page Dib structure completely with divs and using CSS to position things where we want them we want them to be I'm going to start off here just writing out the basic layout structure they like to use I use this from most of my templates start off like this bare-bones I just looked lay out all the divs and and ID's that I'm going to be using so as you can see here I start off with a container I've got a header now and in the header I'm going to have things like the logo a spot for some information up top you know maybe your contact info whatever your navigation of course which will go below both those items now I have a Content area so this will put in any banners any copy associated with the site so my left comes my right columns things like that so you're not typing in the banner and in the left column and in the right column and give them them all IDs because I'm going to use those IDs and apply attributes to them with CSS to tell them where I want them to be and I'll add some quick notes here just so I like to label everything it's easier to scan through later on especially if you're working with another developer so let's type in here real quick heading this is the container and I'll just make just so I know this div goes with the ending with the open container okay great now add the list item this will be the actual links to the navigation so I'll toss in maybe four of them here link I just play URLs a dummy but obviously you put whatever you know web page or within your web page wherever you going to be linking to and I'm copying pasting to save some time this is a very quick demo very bare-bones but you would get an idea of the foundation of other structural look so you can see I'm starting to add a copy toss in a couple labels so we'll know where things are as we're building we'll be able to see where they are put banner left column the right column content and the footer great so that's just without even any CSS added yet just text so let's scroll up here well just make sure it looks pretty good going to close these up shortcut ctrl shift J you can collapse divs make the page a little shorter so now I'm going to add in my style so so put up a style tag and just start typing here so I'm going to setup the HTML tab is the HTML will define the entire site so everything is going to have a font Arial and the color 3 3 3 which is a dark grey unless you define it somewhere else within the CSS document so if I decide that I want maybe a paragraph tag or a link to be a different color size I can just choose to write those in there and it will override the above stop command so I'm just setting up the container here let's just open it up so we can see what we'll work with we're going to write the header next and I'm doing this fairly small 600 is not your typical web page size but we do have a small video screen here so I'm trying to keep it you know legible but at the same time I want to give you the idea of what what page would look like so just enough to fit what we need is an example so I'll continue to adhere Li the logo in and the logo is going to be on the top left so I'm going to want to float that left and I'll just kind of width and height to it whoops real again I mentioned this already this is very basic I'm only using colors and just simple fonts just to give you an idea of you know how a frame looks from scratch and you can use this as a guide or just you know copy the code if you want and then add in your own images and graphics that are going to make the site look like a real professional website so the top info here is floating right okay I'm putting maybe a search engine or some small miscellaneous links could go up there you can see it starting to take some shape okay your header over the logo and I'll start putting together the nav and really come together in a few minutes so let's add a nav bar and the nav bar I'm going to want to add a height and I'm also going to want to clear it now I'm clearing it and what that means is the logo and the top info on the right are floating so if I don't clear the nav bar it's going to be underneath I mean layered on top of each other underneath the logo on the top info by clearing the nav bar we're going to push the entire navigation below the logo and the top information on the right and here I'm adding my list item I want them all to be floating left which is spacing in between and same with the links actually I think I want to hmm yeah let me just put in a size here and let the fonts be too big notice they weren't floating laughing to float the links left and I need to just so happens here what are added the padding to the wrong section bear with me here we go sorry I'm thinking as I'm billing so I need to okay I think this should be good let's uh continue on here from the banner and I'll just toss in any color another gray and white a height maybe clear that so it goes below the nav toss in our left column and follow that by the right column in a minute a little width here now I have a general idea of what width and height I want to use because I know the main container is 600 so the left column in the right column are going to be around 290 just under 300 to give a little space in between because I'm going to float this obviously left and I'll float the right column obviously right and they'll give us a nice little gap in between them let's say that then we'll toss in the footer actually let me just preview one thing just double check we got all those covered all those divs are open up let's go back refresh you can see now we've got our left column in a right column and I'm going to just the color of the background rather background color so that stands out a little more there you go and we'll also add some padding so the copy isn't so tight against the borders okay hope we're going to decrease the width now since we add padding so we'll minus 40 20 on each side here in this case there we go looks pretty good and when we miss in let's see here put some pay on the banner perfect and the footer is a little tight down there so let's not add the ID for the footer and we'll just put in some padding in there so that's it that's a very basic framework you know a typical average site would kind of look like this now obviously visually but structure wise you've got your logo your top info maybe a banner of some sorts of this group you possibly a home page so there's at CSS you can pause that and review that here's the code again that I wrote for the body area or the content body tag so hopefully this was helpful and let me know if anyone has any questions Thanks
