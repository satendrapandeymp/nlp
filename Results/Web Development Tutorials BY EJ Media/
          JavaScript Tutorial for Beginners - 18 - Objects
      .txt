in this video we're going to go over JavaScript objects and we're not actually going to do any coding in this video so you can kick back and relax put the keyboard aside because I want to just explain the concept of objects and then in the next few videos we'll actually code an object up but in this video and in the next one we're just going to talk about the concepts of what a JavaScript object is now objects are used in literally every hopi language and javascript is no exception to that now when people first hear about objects they are very very intimidated by this and they really are not intimidated actually once you understand the concept they're pretty easy to understand now what if we were creating a game and we wanted to create an orc in our game and so could we use a single variable over here to describe that work in this case we've just got a single variable that holds the value of green now can that really describe what an orc is not really could the variable height with just one value here could that describe an orc not really so by themselves these variables don't mean a lot but if we put them all together wrap them all up and assign them to one variable now they mean something all these variables together assign to this variable orc and yes an object actually is a variable but we can call it an object now because we are putting all these variables into our object variable as I like to call it and so at a basic level that's what an object is we're just taking all of these variables wrapping them all up and putting them in between these squiggly brackets and that gets us our object because we can now assign it to one variable our variable work now the other important point to make here is it the variables that we put in here should be related to an orc not something else so for instance I wouldn't put a value in here for a car engine or something that is unrelated to an orc that's the point of an object these all should be related in some way to our object which is an orc now once we put variables inside an object they are actually called properties and so that's what they call them they are variable State but they want to use the name property so they actually are called properties so again I want you to start thinking of objects as something that exists in real life and objects in real life have multiple properties and you can think of literally anything think of a lamp a lamp has multiple properties it has a height it has a width it has a lampshade it has a manufacturer those are all properties that we could put inside of our object and store them now how do we access an object it's very simple we use the object name which in this case is or that always comes first followed by a dot and basically all the dot does is tell JavaScript what we're going to access inside of our object in this case height so think of it that way it's just a way to access a specific property inside of our object and in this case height we could put weight here we could put color and so that's what that dot does and so the property always comes after the dot the object name always comes before the dot so that's the way to understand that now you might have also noticed something else this variable or property inside of our object looks a little bit different from our standalone variable you'll notice that we lopped off the var and that's the key point here we don't put the var keyword in here and you'll also notice we drop the equal sign and now we're using a colon and we don't use a semicolon we use a comma to separate each one of our properties the last one doesn't actually need a comma so the last one doesn't need one you can actually put a comma there but it doesn't need it now you will also hear these properties referred to as name value pairs so this is the name this is the value together they're called name value pairs so just yet another nomenclature that you might hear out there so at a basic level that is how objects work now you might ask the question well wait a minute in the last video we did these arrays and they hold multiple values aren't those objects as well in the answer to that is yes but they are not normal objects in the way we like to think of them they're a little bit different now the main difference is you will remember in the last video each one of these values has an index so this first one would be 0 the second one would be 1 this third one would be 2 and so on but normal objects have the name value pair we don't need to use index we just specify a name here and then associate our value over here it's just an index number now it's a lot easier to remember a name than it is a number so that's why objects are much easier to use if you have different data types and in this case we have a string data type this case we have an integer for our data type we could also have a boolean as a true/false so arrays are really not practical for storing different types of data types they're actually better if you're storing one type of data type and especially if you're using integers so if we go one two three four five six seven eight we had to store a bunch of integers and in that case arrays are useful because we don't necessarily need to remember the name but we'll talk about arrays in future videos and why we want to use arrays as opposed to objects but objects are going to be the primary thing you're going to be dealing with because once again that name value pair is much easier to use that an index so if we wanted to access the height I don't have to go in here and find out what the index is I can just write ork dot height and then we can go ahead and do whatever we want with the value so let's flip back to the other slide so once again we are simply taking a bunch of variables that are doing something similar and wrapping it up into an object in this case ork and again that gets us our object now in this video we've just talked about properties that describe our object but what if artwork needs to run and perform some actions well that's different because properties don't do that they just describe the orc but they do not provide any action and so there are two parts to an object there are the properties that describe the object and then there are actions that the orc can do such as run swim eat all these different actions and that's what we will talk about in the next video see you guys
