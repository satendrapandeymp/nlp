what's up guys were back so now we're going to talk about elements versus attributes and what an attribute is now elements are made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag so for example this heading here we have the opening tag h1 and in closing tag what do they do they tell the browser information that is between the two tags so for a paragraph tag it's telling them that there's text here for an h1 or a heading tag it's telling the browser there's a heading here and then for the body tag it's telling it that everything between these tags makes up the web content that's visible that's the basic level of what elements do now what's the difference between a tag and an element not a whole lot they're almost one in the same but if we're getting technical the angle brackets so the brackets on either side here are the element and the P in the middle tags that element as a P element so you'll hear a lot of you out there and you're coding you'll hear people refer to them as tags very very acceptable common practice are the elements yes are they tags yes if you get a question on a quiz it's an element so now let's talk about attributes attributes give a little bit more information about a particular element more functionality many but not all HTML elements allow you to set attributes an attribute is an additional code within an opening element tag and that's the keyword here opening so I added an attribute here in the paragraph so it says class equals test it's in the opening paragraph tag we would never see an attribute in a closing tag when we use an attribute we are providing two pieces of information an attribute name and the value that we are assigning to that attribute now although it's made up of two parts you're always going to have three character the attribute name of class the equal sign and then the value so again two parts but three pieces when we throw in that equal sign there now attributes are important they help us down the road when we start to apply CSS in the next few weeks because when we write our CSS which is how we style this so that all websites out there don't just have your basic core your new font text with white backgrounds the way that we get the styles that we desire is by using CSS and CSS looks at our attributes in order to determine where to apply the styles that we want so for example the class attribute later on when we do CSS we'll say when we see the test class make the font for example blue so attributes may not seem like they're doing a whole lot for you now but just know they definitely come in handy when we start to apply some style now attributes are specific to the element that they're assigned so this class attribute is specific to this paragraph element and some attributes only go with specific elements but for example I'm just going to type down here which is of course outside of my HTML so I'm just showing you some an example could be the label element has an attribute that can be used of the word before fo R and then we would type in example name and then close that tag so the for attribute can only be used with the label element so we'll see more about that later when we start building some forms so again attributes are most important when we dive into CSS but they are also important to HTML so here the red I'm using aptana studio 3 in this example it automatically made my attributes red so they stand out and we have the language attribute here which tells the browser that this website is in English that's what the en stands for and then in my head I have meta our set utf8 so it's telling them what type of character encoding I am using and then down here again we talked about the class attribute which later on if we were doing CSS we can tell it that when it sees the test class to apply the following styles to whatever paragraphs that have that attribute assigned now you're thinking okay well so attributes what kind of attributes are there is this it oh heck no there's a lot of attributes out there and once again our friends over at w3c is always the best place to go so I went have this website pulled up for you here w3 schools comm you could even just do it yahoo search of HTML attributes the very top one not the ad always stay away from the ads the very top one takes you to the HTML attributes page and it gives us the list of most commonly used attributes the alt for alternative text very important for accessibility disabled which specifies that an input element should be disabled href which we'll start using when we play with links later on the ID very important for CSS source you'll start to see this as we add links and/or images to our pages style which we will talk about with CSS and then title giving an element a title which is displayed as a tooltip so if you hover over something then you'll get that tooltip if it has that attribute so but is this it now again of course not there are more attributes than you can memorize but this is why it's important to understand there are resources out there that you can look up anytime you want to see what options you have available to you so here is the link to the HTML attribute references and then it gives us a full list and as you can see the list is very long we will use a number of these in these video tutorials over the next few weeks but not all of them so I encourage you to go and take a look at the attributes and when possible give one a try play around with them understand what they do this reference sheet is helpful because not only does it give you the possible attributes it tells you which element they belong to in the event they only work with specific elements and it tells you what it does in the description so a great reference to have and that's it I hope you have a better understanding on what attributes are the only way you're really gonna understand it is you get in and play with the code yourself be sure to subscribe to watch more videos and I will see you next time
