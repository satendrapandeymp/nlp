hello guys welcome to my channel this is the twenty second tutorial in this course in this tutorial we'll be checking out a very interesting feature of HTML and that is to embed audio clips in web pages and the HTML file that I have here is very simple online where one I have the doctype declaration and then between the opening and closing HTML tags on lines 2 and 14 respectively I have the head section in the body section and the head section has the title tags and a title of the web pages embedding audio in web pages and then inside the body section I have the heading of the page first on line number seven I have used the opening and closing h1 tags and the text that's enclosed is here some music for you and then on line number eight I have the audio element with the attribute controls and this article doesn't take any value you know it's I'll tell you what the significance of the controller attribute is in just a minute then on line number nine I have another element that goes along with the audio element right so you have to keep the audio element first and then within it include the you know the source element or the source tag and you know as I said this has to be within it so you close your audio element after you close your source element and the source element is used to you know tell the browser where the the file is kept and what the type of the file is so you tell the name of the file and the extension you know through the SRC attribute so you type in SRC the name of the attribute you use the equal to symbol and then within double quotes as a value to it you pass in the name of the file along with the extension so the file name that I'm going to use is audio Road mp3 and this is in the same folder as this HTML file right so I have these two files or in a folder that I have on my desktop so you know this is the folder and this is the file I guess it's tutorial - 22 so this is a file and then the audio clip that I am using for the web page is also in the same folder that's why I haven't included the full path of of the file here but if suppose I had it in a different folder you know I handed in the music folder then you know all you have to do if you have your file in the music folder or in some other folder is go to the file you know wherever it is and you know just right click on it go to properties and copy the file location and paste it here because you will have to you know put the full path of the file if you don't have it in the same folder as your HTML file and then the source element also requires you to include the type attribute and the type attribute takes the you know format of the file so if it's an audio MPEG file then that's what you have to include here if it's a flat format file then you have to include that and the format also goes within double-quotes and then I have closed the source element using the forward slash and the greater than symbol and then I also have a paragraph of text on line number ten you know I have the opening P tag on line number eleven I have the closing P tag and the text that's enclosed is your browser does not support this file or feature and this text will be displayed only if you know your web browser is unable to play this file for some reason right and then I have closed the audio element close the body section close the you know entire HTML file and you know this is how the file looks when I open it in Google Chrome and I'm gonna play this file for you so what you can do is you can you know scroll back you can scroll forward if you want to and you know you can adjust the volume you can pause it you can play it so you know these controls are sufficient I mean if you have an audio clip on a website you know what more can you ask for you can play pause you can move forward backward and then you can adjust the volume right and then you know let's talk about this controls thing now so let's say I remove this from my audio element I'll save the file and go back to Chrome and I'll refresh my page and I see now that you know all the controls that I was just talking about they're gone now right so this is the significance of the controls attribute there it helps you have the play/pause buttons and then you know it helps you adjust the volume and you know obviously you can seek forward or backward so I'll get it back and save the file and refresh it in chrome again to have the controls back and you know it plays wonderfully right so that's it for this tutorial I'll see you guys in the next tutorial which will discuss more interesting features of HTML and I hope you guys are having fun in the course and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already I see you the next video till then take care
