[Music] hi guys welcome to nourish a technology so Brazil in this video session we can view form controls all that in previous video session six controls I covered date date time day time local month time week in this video session we can see seven controls so six plus seven total 13 input controls first one color for color chooser second one email email entry so Auto validated you no need to write any JavaScript just once you are entering the email ID you format correct it takes otherwise read boundary line it displays number numerical spinels we are calling yes we can see that one range this is called sliders and as such yes such means not like Google search box it is a such what it is exactly I will show you practically till telephone telephone numbers also it validates automatically URL Uniform Resource locator how nicely it is validating URL address we can view so first I am showing to you colors nowadays almost all there are a lot of colors existed in the rebbe environment for example I explained in my video session series I think fourth video session you can view you will get regarding color and color Pickers and their explained RGB a red the green blue and alpha or amber so there 256 into 256 into 256 into 256 is equal to whatever the colors we are displaying those colors we can display by using simply a color chooser so come to the color chooser how we are going to be and it is displaying complex JavaScript a color picker but you are not writing any JavaScript it is displaying color picker like that input type is equal to name come to practical without our valuable time visiting I implemented same previously whatever the logic is there but right now just the simple I change input type is equal to color so generally name we are using for the JavaScript purpose now if you are going to run the same example on any web browser and you can view select your favorite color and click on that once you click and it displaying 16 million color picker is there are GB alpha or amber still 2 but right now RGB available these are the three zeros available if you observe very clearly three zeros are there three zeros indicating black color already clearly black shade now for example one color you are increasing to 255 it is going to red color and another color also you are giving 255 for example it is coming to a local er and for example you are giving 199 and that is orange color so like this for example this is you are providing 255 the shade in pink and it is also 255 not both are a messy color 255 means white color so I guess the color is white least the color is black so without the writing JavaScript imperfect color picker is ready in front of you just you can set the collect color color and you can click on OK so the particular color will be set right so this is called HTML for you color picker no need to remember any hexadecimal color codes no need to remember any color names it is a topmost feature in html5 right we'll go to another one so the second one is nothing but email what exactly email how to validate that so automatically it is validating for small definition we can see it is user input fields email input tag gives a way to request email address in your web form right simply I am coming to my source code and enter valid email ID enter valid email ID right remaining whatever existed remove that save it and color remove email you can say Auto validation doing or not I am giving name so the sake of JavaScript reminding all are as usual I am coming here and refresh and you want some colors means in the previous video session all that I shown to you style is equal to color blue font family whatever the family can keep common I am using Tahoma though my is not my friend just it is a look looking wise appearance which is good for you so now I am entering for example K is Raju that is email id no that is not email ad automatically read underline click on that please enter an email address so this is the advantage without writing a single line JavaScript now you want to see that perfectly you want to enter enter now our dear 8 7 Gmail comma comma comma come is not the pattern is dot-com so facebook.com is now Silver boundary means perfect click on that it is going to the next page so next page perfectly you want to see my destination page name you can change definitely you can view that yes perfect so this is email id validation so without writing javascript in HTML file input type is equal to email is validating electronic mail address but there is a problem here for example I didn't enter anything whenever you are not entered it is not validating that time it is going to next page automatically so to avoid this go back you need to implement one powerful attribute is called required required is equal to required yes and refresh that required and now you can click on that never allows so required is nothing but it is making the field mandatory so whenever MP existed please try to view that enter required attribute it is a new attribute from html5 attributes whenever I am discussing attributes definitely I will show you multiple examples on required so uses of the required you can observe not only multiple you can give direct to required also because it is generating boolean values just required you can say only this click on that don't enter click perfectly working so this is and here title is coming this title also we can able to add we cannot change existing one but with the help of bootstrap with the help of jQuery our own pop-ups we can display our own message balloons we can display but existed one predefined one unable to overwrite right come back to our original environment of another control so email explained email which required also explained we'll go to next one is called required attribute just now explained to you it is making mandatory number number is nothing but we are popularly known as spinners numerical spinners we can call if you go to electro ecommerce website in e-commerce website different different controls available you want to select the quantity quantity 2 3 4 5 for example why one get one you selected one automatically one adding so like this controls you want to develop compulsory we are visiting for the number numerical spinners attributes available you can observe max min step value practically what is max min step increment or decrement value default we can try to observe and at the same time I implemented the related description also very clearly my notes existed for you just read that before you are practicing whatever the examples I am showing to you right guys now we can go there type is equal to number yes number name is equal to just I am giving them and no submit message record I am NOT taking required also okay why for words as already explained all per non-paid text style and enter enter or select any one we can do here that is advantage enter or select valid and but valid number good and you can come down refresh and once you refresh it that mouse-over yes spinner displayed I didn't implemented any kind of attribute by D bodies showing up arrow and down arrow this called spinners + + - - just click on that starting with 1 increment 1 max value I didn't say so it is incrementing like that decrementing again yes negative value is also displaying but it is only giving one increment one decrement right come back to our source code so by default value by default empty nothing available now I want to by default value 0 come down and simply you can say with input type is equal to number value is equal to 0 good and refresh now observe perfect by default value 0 now I want a minimum must be for example I want a minimum value 6 save it and click on that refresh and click on the new value 6 increment 1 only 1 by 1 right and and I said step equal to I want to do step here for so whenever I am giving for initial value 0 you know that and the minimum value is 6 6 + 4 next value 10 10 plus 4 14 like that how much incrementing for incrementing but my max value not declared it is taking a big number not like that my max value is my max value I want to take 51 for example now I want to refresh observe the control properly yes now now you can see the controls because of maximum 51 I said 50 plus 4 54 not allowed come down this one because the minimum 6 good so completed numerical values very useful without writing again je s we can easily use these controls of the key commas of it our food product is whatever the products we are going to order food items in an online right now we can try to observe another one is a range how this range is working for example whenever you are using range range also having same attributes but here no entry only select no entry only select that is the range so whenever we are using range you want to see a numerical value whenever you are by default is there Center exactly left side negative values right side is positive values if you want to see something about that whenever you are tracking that you want to see the increment or decrement values like that I am expecting see here decreasing see here increasing I want previous one previously whatever the values I shown to you same thing so same kind of value equal to zero and a min equal to five little bit different I am showing for equal to four and step equal to 4 and Max equal to six zero right come to browser refresh observe only starting value and and it is providing to you whatever whatever it is providing first the value 0 and minimum step maximum so these must be where you need to provide miss please we provided we need to provide with the range yes and what were rated now refresh 0 come on move it observe it is incrementing 13 17 21 25 for incrementing this is a scale so number spender is different a range is different you need to observe that maximum you can go that six to zero is out so this is called range range we are calling as slider so both are both are having same attributes you need to observe it put on practice update the web browser all browsers are supporting browser compatibility problem is not there but you want to see the numerical values very clearly try to use ie edge very clearly visible to you otherwise Android otherwise iOS because mobile compatible perfectly available here now next one we can see the other control the other control is nothing but so such such is nothing but not like Google one and first we need to read about what exactly the such meaning so if you are going to such area there providing some information how the such textbox is working we can define a textbox as such a box instead of normal text box notice there is a blue cross sign appears only blue Kasane not black outside in that text box when you input something then in the search box when you click on the class your input string will be disappear means it will be clear and how it is going to be work out right input type enter any string now I am entering into the string is nothing but simple I can say such input type is equal to name I am putting like that name I am NOT disturbing so name also I am changing as STR that's all now I want to refresh refresh introducing I am entering for example various technologies right for observable nourish I technologies already glucose and k if you click it will be disappeared so if you are removing all the characters at least one character value loss across I will come see I am removing in front of manual I am removing that also removed the sign will be disappear now for example I'm entering JavaScript C first splitter once you entered click on that this is such box actually in Google you people are comparing that is a jacks control this is a different one definitely I will show you in other video that one but right now I am showing html5 built-in features even I am NOT writing in JavaScript also because first what is a feature existed we need to see then I will add a JavaScript for that word and after that I am going to next one is cell telephone so actually presently it is not working on mobile devices to control on mobile devices the uses of the keyboard to decrease or to make it customization we are using actually the spell what is the TEL means particular pattern not it release but even though by using pattern attribute from JavaScript regular expression object is there regular expression object has pattern attribute by using that a particular pattern we can assign that is called a 10 so tell currently particular pattern is not there even though enter valid telephone number okay now I am entering that valid a telephone number inside such is there such area simple am entering tell name T number I am entry le phone number here pattern I need to write so without writing pattern I am showing to you just you can observe it is taking numbers nine eight triple six and nine ABCD it is also taking so meaningless that one so that time we can implement pattern pattern equal to first the required attribute ax can write better required is equal to required then pattern equal to pattern equal to quotation start and you can Ruggiero to nine because of numerical values plus maximum minimum mobile number available ten numbers I'm giving for the mobile number validation we can do minimum karma maximum also latter we can see first pattern now once you are entering refresh that completely see whenever do miracle values available that underlined remove that now entered were quickly nine eight triple six completed because it is a perfect 10 characters now one character remove one character exploit you can add see how nicely validation doing this is a pattern attribute importance so pattern attribute allowing a particular pattern but by default it tell is not supporting perfect a telephone numbers with the help of pattern attribute we can practice that so you also check it now click on that required executing now now one perfect number add reboot out perfect these ten numbers are well we joined you can count it also now you can click it will go to next page yes so pattern attribute help is that one next and final the last one is URL what is the URL exactly enter valid URL yes you are I'm adding so once you are l you are adding here and I said URL and I am removing I don't want all these numbers anything just write and once added URL URL label I am entering simply the name also you want no required nothing I don't want any pattern right save it and once you are going to learn that enter valid e one for example I'm entering www.narang.com planted perfect website but if you come out from there it so red border line y means invalid URL as for the end user correct but as for the software engineer in correct because HTTP compulsory now for example I'm entering HTTP HTTP colon double forward slash perfect there is no click on this is going to next page right now you can come back remove WWD folder my of it come out perfectly quickly so which is compulsory ER HTTP is mandatory because hypertext Transfer Protocol which is a transferring our request to server which is bringing from server to client so try to understand that every time you need to mention HTTP that URL only valid here thank you for watching my videos for more videos subscribe in youtube.com slash
