in this lesson we're gonna learn how to add more pages inside a website because as you may have noticed so far we've been using our front page snow to learn HTML and CSS and when you typically look at a website online with more than just one page so I thought it'd be a good idea to learn how to have more pages this early on so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to above my root folder and inside my root folder guys consider we have a file called indexed at HTML and a file called styled at CSS now when it comes to including files inside your root folder you know inside the actual project folder your front page has to be called index dot something which we talked about in one of the first episodes in this course here and the reason for that is that when we do X need to upload the website online we need to upload the website to a server and the server always looks for a file called index dot something because it's going to look at this file as the front page of your website however when it comes to sub pages inside your website we can call these whatever you like of course there's a piece of guidelines to what should actually be using inside the page name such as if it were to go inside my text editor here and create a new page and save it inside my root folder I probably shouldn't be using any capitalized letters also should not be using any sort of weird symbols or anything that might mess up the file name so it's a good idea to stick with non capitalized letters and something simple that indicates what the file is actually used for such as if it were to create a contact page how to call it contact dot HTML for example and then I can say save and now I guys can see we have a contact page now when we want to set up this new page we need to actually create some content inside of it just like with it inside the front page so I'm going to copy what we have inside the front page so far and just paste it inside our contact document now the important thing here is like inside the front page you need to have certain tags that has to be inside any kind of new document and if you're in doubt about which tags we need to have inside this document when we create a new document go ahead and look at the episode at the beginning of this course where we talk about what you need to have inside and pay to any creator for the first time so I just covered in the content from our front page what I'm going to do is I'm going to change just a few things because inside my front page I had a h1 tag that said welcome to my portfolio so I'm going to pretend for a second that this is a portfolio website and inside the page I also have a paragraph that says welcome to my personal portfolio feel free to look around the website so inside the contact page you can then change the text or says contact page or something a bit more Creator than this and then go down to the paragraph tag and again if the text goes outside your screen go up to you click toggle soft wrap and you guys can see we can see all the text inside the active screen here now I'm going to change the text here so it says name : Daniel Nielsen gonna copy to the line of code paste it on Neath it and include something like I don't know telephone number or email we can say e-mail could be use at mmm toots dot net if I wanted to and we can keep adding details we wanted to but again this is just to demonstrate that that we have a page with different content and if it were to actually access this inside the browser we can then see another page so if we were to go back inside the website you guys can see that this is the text out of my front page if we were to refresh just to reset everything it still looks the same because we didn't change anything inside the front page but if you take a look at the URL up here in the top you guys can see that we have our root folder and inside a root folder the current document that were viewing is the one called index dot HTML if it were to change this to contact dot HTML you guys can see we now have a new page with different content inside of it so what we just did here is we went ahead and created a new page but we haven't created a link for it yet which is something that we're gonna look into in the next episode so can actually access this page without having to you know go up inside the URL and serve something different than what we just had here so I can actually go back to the index page by writing index dot HTML and as you guys can see we now have the front page again so what I plan to do in this course here is in some episodes from now I would like to start making a portfolio website together with you guys with the skills to be learning these lessons here so we're gonna take everything that we learned and then slowly we're gonna build up something that actually looks like a real website because right now as you guys can see this is just basic text inside you know a white background is not really a website so we're gonna go and build up a portfolio from scratch using this coaster we learned these lessons and in the next episode like I said we're gonna start by learning how to create links inside the website so so I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time
