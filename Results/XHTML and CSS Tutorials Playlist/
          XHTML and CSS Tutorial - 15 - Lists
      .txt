what's going on everybody welcome back to your 15th XHTML and CSS tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to be covering the lists but before I do I want to talk to you guys about this doctype right here because I thought I could get away with it but I've been getting a lot of hate mail and people are complaining about this doctype for good reason you know how I said that every XHTML document needs to have a doctype to make a valid well the truth is that this is not a valid doctype and I shouldn't even be telling you this but to be completely honest if you go ahead and delete your doctype altogether then your browser is still going to read your webpage and it's probably going to be just fine but if you want to make a valid doctype and valid XHTML document you know you might want to do this if you're making a website for someone or if you had a job designing websites um you need to have a valid doctype so let me go ahead and grab one from over here that is what a valid doctype looks like I think there are three major kinds strict which is like you need to write your code exactly transitional which is the best of the new XHTML in the old HTML and I think there's one called frameset don't ever use that because that has to deal with using the old HTML frames and I'm not even going to teach you guys what frames are because they're worthless and I hate them and no one uses them so um that is what valid doctype looks like I just didn't want to throw this on you guys in the first tutorial because you guys are back alright if this is the crap I'm going to have to learn then I'm just going to quit watching these stories right now anyways I'm going to go ahead and leave that in there right now so uh yeah now I have a valid XHTML document so now we can continue with the meat of this tutorial and that is covering a list not Lisp like list like lis T so the first list I'm going to cover is probably the most common list and that's an unordered list and whenever you make an unordered list on your webpage it's just going to take the items and make them appear as bullet points so when would you want to use an unordered list say you're making a website of like things you want for christmas those things don't really need to be in order um you know because you want all of them so you don't need them numbered or anything it's just like a bulleted list so enough of me talking let's go ahead and make that right now in order to make an unordered list the keyword is ul and of course the ending is ul so now here is where your list starts and here is where your list ends % Buckey there's nothing in my list well let's go ahead and change it so in between your tags anytime you want to add an item to your list you need to add the tag Li this stands for a list item and of course the ending li now anything you put in between here is going to be an item in your list and you can have as many items as you want so let's go ahead and make this my Christmas list so what do I want for Christmas let me think real quick new sunglasses because my older ones are scratched up and let's just go ahead and copy this because I'm lazy and all right so we want new sunglasses what else do I want a computer can never have too many computers um I want some paintings did I spell that wrong good perfect paintings for my walls and by the way why am i saying this because I'm in my office right now and on my walls there are like 4 hooks where paintings or photos or something should go and I don't have any paintings or anything to hang on there so now I just have four dumb looking hooks on my wall so anyways I want some paintings for my walls alright and last but not least I want a hot pocket because hot pocket air hey close enough everyone needs a hot pocket on Christmas it's just like a rule so let's go ahead and save this and now you can see what a Norn under unordered list looks like see like I told you it's just a bunch of bullet points so anytime you want to make a list and they don't need to be in particular order this is what type of list you would use again the keyword is ul and the items in it are Li so let's go ahead and I change this up and now since they made something called an unordered list you figure it only makes sense for them to make an ordered list well if you thought that then you're right so an ordered list is keyword Oh L and let me just go ahead and end this Oh L and you put items in here just the same as you would an unordered list the only difference between an unordered list and ordered list is whenever you make an ordered list things are going to appear numbered first item is going to be 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 you don't need a number them explicitly your browser is going to do that for you automatically so let me go ahead and show you again to add a list item an ordered list is the exact same as a nun or list just go ahead and put Li and end it with end Li let's just go ahead and copy this and paste this baby right now paste paste paste so the first thing into my order list so first of all let's back up why would you use an ordered list well say you want to give someone directions or instructions how to do something step 1 step 2 step 3 or maybe you know the top ten movies you want to see this summer one two three four five seven eight nine ten you know anytime you want an order list use order list fair enough so let's go ahead and make an order list in instructions on how to have a wonderful day so number one go to youtube and notice I'm not typing number one anywhere because the my browser is going to do that for me automatically step two type in the new Boston step three watch all the videos that pop up and step four eat a hot pocket because we got to throw a hot pocket in there sometimes so that is the instructions and how to have a wonderful day so let's go ahead and save this and refresh it and see what we got as you can see it automatically numbered our list for us so that saves us the trouble of you know having to do it ourselves and it's also convenient when you have to go back and change something it's going to reorder it for you automatically so that is the basics of how to create an unordered list and an ordered list um you're going to be using them a lot more frequently than you think in web design so get to know them um they're pretty easy to understand so that's it so if you have any questions go ahead and ask me on my forum at the New Boston comm and either I or someone else or answer for you so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys later
