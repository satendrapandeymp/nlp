hello so by request I'm going to show you how to set up a script that allows you to swap videos from Vimeo comm and an iframe so here we have a very simple page and it has an embedded video from Vimeo comm and also up above it there are some links that basically link to other videos on Vimeo calm and if I click one of those links it takes me out to Vimeo and takes me away from my page so what I want to do is make it so that when I click these video links rather than go to Vimeo com instead the video just reloads in this iframe below so let's look at the source code the HTML and here you see we've just got an iframe that's embedded here at the bottom of the page and we're setting the width and the height of that iframe in the CSS so down that allows us later on if you want to do media queries we can always change that then further down we have up around the top of the page we have an unordered list with links to the various videos here so we're going to set up a script now that makes this a little bit more dynamic so the first thing I'm going to do is go out to the jQuery website and here you can see where you can download the jQuery library now there are different versions I'm going to download the I guess we'd say the the version that's the most widely supported and that would be this jQuery one dot 10.2 so I downloaded that I put it on my in my own folder that I'm working with I've given it a title so I'm just going to copy this file name and I'm going to switch back to my HTML page and I'm just going to put in a script tag here in the header with the source that is the file name for the JavaScript file for the jQuery library close that up and now I'm going to start another script tag that is going to house the function that I'm going to use to swap these videos so I've done a little bit of googling I googled for the search phrase change iframe source on click jQuery and I went around and looked at some of the options that came up and I found this one that I thought looked kind of handy and simple and so I'm going to use this so I'm just going to copy this this little code snippet here come back over to my HTML file and I'm just going to drop that code snippet right into my my HTML up there in the header between the script tags there ok now this isn't exactly ready to go we've got to do a couple of changes but let me describe what's happening here so this script is set up so that when the document is ready to be manipulated so that's this document dot ready function which is unique to jQuery then this function and of it's going to basically execute a function that says any anchor tag that is clicked will then trigger a function to where the item that is clicked so that's what is passed here through the e this is picking up the item that was clicked that item has a particular function that's unique to jQuery performed on it that prevents the default action from occurring in this case the default action when you click on an anchor tag is that it goes to the URL that is put in the href so it's going to prevent that default action from happening and then it's going to find an item with the ID that's referenced here in this case some frame and it's going to set the source attribute of that item to be the attribute of the hypertext reference of what we just clicked so let's just swap some of these values out we want to be a little bit more specific on targeting our anchor tags just in case we want to do more at this page and having don't end up manipulating this fine so we're going to just be looking for any anchor tag that's within the unordered list with an ID of videos I'll just add another we'll just put in a descendant selector then for ul with an ID of videos then descending down to the list item and the anchor tag sort and sanny anchor tag within the unordered list of the idea videos that's clicked will have this function performed on it okay and then also we're going to need to change the ID of the iframe that we're targeting so we made our ID video so we'll just change that from some frame to Vimeo and so now we're saying when we click our anchor then prevent the default action which will be to go to this Vimeo video on Vimeo comm and so prevent that from happening but instead go and find the element with the ID of Vimeo and set its attribute to the hypertext reference of the anchor tag we just clicked all right let's say that let's go over to our site and we'll refresh so just a little refresh there from my keyboard let things load and now let me click these links tada it swaps out our iframe and everything is just occurring on the page without the page itself reloading you can click and you can play the video here within the iframe and everything is hunky-dory there you go that's how you do it
