hey everyone Jamie here from technical cafe.com welcome to your 16th HTML tutorial in the previous tutorial we talked about how to create HTML forms in the example we use there was the login form where users could enter in their username password and then click on the login button so the form that the example that we're going to be using today is a little bit different it's a registration form and I just created a example one so what this is going to contain it's going to contain a fields for a username a password and then we're going to add in two options which are gender using radio buttons here so the user can only pick one option and favorite food and it's going to allow the user to click as many as apply so the username and password fields that we have here as well as the register button are pretty similar to what we were working on in the last tutorial so if you haven't seen that you can just a check out the last tutorial that we'll go over it again in this one as well so these right here are called radio buttons and these only allow you to select one or the other so you can people with male and female here so it allows you to pick only one and these right here for the favorite food are checkboxes and I'm sure you've seen these all over the internet somewhere so these allow you to pick as many as you want so let's say you like fruit and you like salad and you like a cheeseburger as well but you don't like ice cream or pizza it allows you to select just those ones or you can select all if you like at all or if you don't like any though some of these things on here pretty good you can just unselect all of them and when you click register like we also talked about in the last tutorial it'll bring you to a processed up PHP page where the values would contain within these elements here are all passed to a different page to be dealt with either entered into a database or whatever the programmer chose to do so let's take a look at the code over here so here we have it this is the code that we're going to be using for this tutorial here it just involves a lot of input type so well let's clear this out and we'll get to work on it here so delete everything here so this is our page here we still have the title creating HTML forms similar to last time so let's go about creating our form first we're going to create a little bit of a header will use h3 and if you remember from that tutorial that it's somewhere in the middle of the headers with h6 being the smallest in h1 being the largest so we'll say creating HTML forms and we'll save that come over here and take a look and here's our nice title on our page here so let's come down and we'll work on creating our form so the first thing we're going to say is please register below and app because this is going to be a registration form as opposed to a login form so if you'll save come over and take a look and let us have our basic stuff setup here so let's go about making the actual form itself so we'll say form and then we'll create a closing form tag and in between these two tags if you remember all the form elements are going to go so the first element we're going to have is a user name element so we'll say input type equals in that if you remember from last tutorial as well it's for a textbox all you need to do is enter in text and it's going to basically tell the browser that there's a text input here so so we'll give this a name as well we're going to call this user name and that this name right here if you'll remember is what's passed on to the other script so it's going to be passed on to our processed PHP which will enter in in a second and we'll do the same for the password field so input type equals password name equals password and we'll close that off there if you'll notice that these two right here the input boxes do not need a closing tag so they don't need a input closing but it's just a kind of a good thing to do if you add in the slash here I believe it's not required but that's just kind of a good practice to get into I guess so right here what we have is our two input boxes will save that come over here and take a look you'll notice that the right next to each other and one isn't a name input or text box and the other is a password box so let's go ahead and add some text so the users know what they're actually entering entering in so we'll say username and then we'll put a colon in the space and for the password password colon space and we'll save that so we're going to do now is for a registration form I kind of want the things to be in line with another so one after another so we'll use instead of a br spacing which I think kind of leaves in a little close together and it's kind of hard to differentiate between the two we're going to use a paragraph break so in order to do that we'll just create some paragraph tags and just leave it empty and that'll give us a space like you would have in a regular paragraph so here's our using the inbox in our password box so now let's go about adding our radio buttons and in order to do that we're going to actually add another paragraph space and we'll say gender so if we save this come along and refresh you'll notice that now we have a section for the users to enter in their their gender so what we're going to do for this is we're going to create a radio button so we're going to do is we're going to say input type equals so it's the same as entering a text box or a button and the type that we're going to be using is going to be it's going to be radio so when we save this come over here and take a look you'll notice that we have this stray radio button and it looks like a an eye or something so if we I just refresh here to get rid of that and we're going to enter in another one so input type equals radio so if we save forgot the clothes are there if we save we'll have two radio buttons and that you'll notice right now that they can both be clicked and it kind of looks like a set of two eyes but they can both be clicked because we haven't yet altered the name elements within or the name attribute within the input element so what we're going to do is we're going to be saying name equals from give it to both from here and it were the name equals you have to have the same name so long as you want the two options to not be able to be chosen at the same time so for example let's just format this real quick we'll say mail and then denieth we'll say female so we'll save that put a space in between using I think we'll use a br for this and we'll save and we have our male and female options we have spaced it out up here too okay so now we have our our gender option we can choose male or female here but you notice that they're both selected and you can't be both so let's just come over here and take a look here so in order to change that we got to give it a we get to give them the same name so we're going to do for this is we're going to say I will say gender and then we'll say a gender so when we save this and come over here and refresh you'll notice that now we can only choose one because they have the same name so if this works good if you want to have only one option can be chosen and if you if you're going to have more than one radio box set of radio boxes throughout it let's say you want one for age and you want to be let them choose the age group that they're in and they can only choose one obviously so that's good to just have some radio buttons in there and just make sure you give it a different name than the gender one so let's just come over here and continue working on this so now that we have a radio buttons working we're going to put in another paragraph space and then we're going to add our favorite food and we'll say in parentheses check all that apply so we'll save that come over here and take a look and here we go so let's just come over here you can add a quick colon in there and make it look a little better and we'll give a quick paragraph break okay so for over here we're going to be adding in check boxes and as you saw in the beginning of this tutorial the check boxes they can all be checked if they want or you can use none of them so it's kind of whatever the user chooses so for this what we're going to do is we're going to just say input type equals and the input type for check box is just check box so if we save that come over here and refresh you'll notice that now we have a check box that we can check and uncheck unlike the radio button where once you click on it you can't get rid of it no matter where you click so let's come in here and we'll give the check box a name attribute and for this one we're going to call this salad we'll call it fruit actually I think that's what I did in the original here so we'll give that a name and we'll say fruit and we'll save that and so now we have the option of fruit so let's just continue on adding some more in here I remember we say input type equals check box and remember to have the equation marks here it might not be as important in HTML as it is in other languages like JavaScript or Java PHP so it's just kind of a good practice to get into especially if you're interested in learning other languages in the future so name will give this will say salad now figure maybe we can put the healthy options up top and we'll save come over here and refresh you notice that we have fruit and salad and they can both be checked at the same time not checked one or the other so I'm going to actually put a spacing between them okay here we go so fruit and salad those are good so let's add a couple more options here and that will just copy and paste this to avoid having to type it so we're going to have the input type equals checkbox and for this one we'll say pizza and then we'll keep adding some more in here just paste it back in and change the name attributes to cheeseburger and then we'll save and refresh and come over here and you'll notice that now we have our check boxes for our favorite foods here and what the explore member from the previous tutorial what these do the named elements or attributes rather is what they send whatever the user typed in are entered to the PHP page or whatever other page you're using so if you remember last time in ours I forgot to actually enter this in here we had an action associated with our form and what the action does is it tells the browser basically where to send the information so depending on what you're doing if you're setting up like a registration form you might want to call the action register or register process PHP or something like that so we'll just call this a process dot PHP just to keep it simple and then you have a method and the method is how you're going to send the data so if you use a get method what happens is the data you'll end up seeing it gets sent over here and you can you'll actually see the variable names and the M the data that's stored in those variables up here in the address bar so that's probably not what you want if you're going to be sending a sensitive data like credit card numbers passwords stuff like that so for that you probably use a post and somehow I may be encrypted so let's just come over here and we will set this equal to post and then for over here we're going to create our final option in the form here and we're going to call this let's say ice cream and when you're using a name attribute it's important that don't leave a space in between it because in other programming languages I'm not sure so much about doing this in HTML but in other programming languages if you're declaring variables you're not going to want to use the space you're going to either want to use an underscore or you're going to want to either capitalize the second word so now for this will just say ice underscore cream and we're going to say ice cream come over here and refresh and here's our five options that we're going to be having for this registration form so the last thing you're going to need to add for this form is a submit button so that the user can actually tell tell the browser you know I'm ready to send this over so we've used some paragraph spacing there and we're going to say input type equals name equals value equals so for this option we're going to have actually three options here or three attributes within this element so the type that we're going to be using is a submit in this but it's going to be we're going to be creating a submit button the name we'll just call it submit so when we get over to the other page maybe we want to say don't let the user come to this page unless the submit buttons been clicked and the value we're going to call it I'm going to show you what it looks like without the value without a value they'll have just an empty button that brings you to the process type PHP page so if we take this off completely I'll notice that we just have a submit query button so we're going to add a value that says register so we'll come over here and refresh and here's our completed form I will just erase it hit that here so you notice that our textbox here allows us to enter in our name our password box lets us enter in our password without it being I shown in case there's someone behind us are looking at our computer or whatnot the gender box allows you to choose either one of the other because we have the same the same name associated with it if we called this one let's say mail will say MOF for male or female we come over here and refresh you'll notice that we can actually choose both and now that's not something that we're going to typically want so we'll just call it gender again so we can now only choose one of the other and for the checkboxes we can choose as many as we want or as little as we want depending on what we're choosing here so once we enter in our username and password and everything select what we like and click register the data will all be sent to the processed up PHP page because we're using our or is it because we're using our action processed PHP and now this can differ depending on what you're doing in our method post just to show you what's what get does if we say method is get and we come back over here and refresh will you enter in our username here we'll say Jamie password we'll say password we'll say male and we'll say I like pizza and we click register notice that all of our variable names or our the names that we associated with these are being sent right up here in the address bar which isn't something that we're going to typically want especially when we're sending passwords other things those too okay for maybe if you're doing a search engine or something but for this is typically not something that you're going to want and now one last thing before we run out of time here if you want to you can actually indent all this stuff here in notepad plus plus you can just highlight and hit tab that way you have a little bit more of a like a feel of what's what so you know where the forum starts where the forum ends and you can just leave all the elements within the forum in the middle that's just a little tip here if you if you want to use that so thank you for watching this tutorial if you have any questions comments or
