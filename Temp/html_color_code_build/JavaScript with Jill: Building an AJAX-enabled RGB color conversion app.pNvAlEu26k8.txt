hi everyone sorry I haven't recorded a video in a while um so last week I was looking into mocha testing mocha testing is really useful it allows you just to test your application and make sure that you're getting the results that you want from it and testing is really important when you're building applications but it was something that I hadn't done before so I found a really useful tutorial online on a website called semaphore that showed me how to build an app an API that let me use mocha testing in conjunction with node in JavaScript so the API that this that this tutorial showed me how to build was to convert a RGB color code into a hex color code and vice versa and I thought that it was a really good idea so I decided to take the API that I built from this tutorial and make it into a full app so I've built a whole interface for this app and a client-side and this is the finished website that I've built I called it color Bert just because you know you're converting your colors so huh and I can convert RGB to hex and hex to RGB just to quickly show you how it works if you just type some random numbers into here for the RGB color values and color birth it a square comes up and gives you a preview of the color and it shows you the hex code at the top and also changes the hex value and the form on the other side of the page to the same code as well or I can you know put a random hex code in here as well converts it back to RGB again it changes the color and it gives me the new RGB color values so I just wanted to give you a quick walkthrough of how this application works ok so I have my HTML file I have you know all my classes that I need for my CSS and my IDs that I need in the different HTML tags that I need to grab those things in JavaScript so I'm I'm grabbing my buttons basically so get element by ID and I have these RGB two hex and hex RGB buttons and I'm adding event listeners to them so I'm listening for a click on the button and when that happens I'm calling different functions to help to convert the values that I've been put into the forum so that's just these buttons here I'm just listening for a click on these buttons and when that happens it calls the function on there on the JavaScript file so far G we two hex I'm asking for a click I call this RGB two hex function so what that does first of all is it grabs the RGB file use from the form so from each of the form field here RGB it grabs each of these values out of the text boxes and it stores them into variables and I just run a quick validation on it to make sure that none of these fields are empty so if it's an empty string then I'll I'll show an alert saying please give you know three values for the RGB code and I want to make sure that the the value for each one is not over 255 which is the maximum number for a color code for an RGB color code and also make sure that the length of the the integer that you're getting is not longer than three digits long so if it passes those validations then what I want to do is grab that the square here I just grabbed that using document I'll get element by ID and I just use JavaScript to change the background color of that div to equal the same values that have been put into the form by the user and from that I call this color bit RGB function and I pass each of these red green and blue values into this function so what this function does is it makes the HTTP request to the API and it passes in the values I need to be converted so I'm using this fetch API fetch is really useful it's an inbuilt API that you can use with JavaScript and all you have to do is pass it a URL and it can make the HTTP request for you so first of all I had to construct the URL to give to fetch so that it can make me HTTP request and so I have on my server I've set up different routes that I can use to call rgb2 hex or hex to RGB and then I just need to pass in to the string the queries for the different values so for red green and blue so I have to pass these variables into this URL just to construct the URL to past effect to hit that API on the back end so I pass back to the URL from here it goes to the server and it hits the slash RGB to hex right and then I'm taking the request HTTP request the query from the URL and I'm pulling out the red green and blue values which we set here red equals green equals blue books and I'm storing those into variables and I'm running a part int with base 10 just so that it will pull out the actual number the integer from the string because we had to convert it to a string to make the URL in the first place so red green and blue then gives the integers for those same values and then I'm passing those values into this other RGB to hex function that comes from this converter file so if you see up here var converter is just equal to requiring this converter J's file up here that's just another file that I have here that I'll show you in a second so I'm calling this function from that file I'm passing in the red green and blue values so to convert those values to hex all we've done is take red green and blue and then convert it to a string and pass in base 16 so that converts the number that we have from the form into a hexadecimal representation of the same number so that'll be an any kind of number between 0 to 9 or any letter between a and F it could be it could be anything so we have these red hex green hex blue hex converted values in base 16 we just want to run this pad function on the first to make sure that the length is right because hex values are always 2 digits long so if you have say a one digit number like eight you want to make sure that it becomes zero eight so that you get a hex value a hex value for that color that is two digits long so if the hex length is equal to one then we'll just pad the string at the friend with a zero and then we're calling the hex or the hex conversion with the the red green and blue hex codes and then returning that to you the the function on the server side from the right so it gets it causes converter function again it stores the result of that into this hex variable and then it passes that back in the HTTP response so if we go back to the the client side it gets the HTTP response back from the fetch from the fetch request so we're using a promise here dot then so I saying once fetch has made that URL call and it's returned something then we're passing it a callback and to run with the response that fetches has returned us that the HTTP response and the response returns inside an object so in order for us to pull out the hex code that we want from that object we have to do response text and then we make another promise so once we've we've got the text from that response then we pass that text into another callback and all were doing here is just getting two of the HTML elements that we want to change and to reflect the value of the converted code on the page so we have just again get element by ID and we're changing both the form field on the opposite side of the page so this hex field here and also this div up here both to show life that was for for an RGB two hex and they'll both show the result of the conversion from RGB to hex and it's much the same obviously for the conversion from hex back to RGB again we listen for a click on the button once we hear that click we call this function to grab the hex code from the form first we just want to run a reg ex on the hex code just to make sure that it's a valid tax code so make sure that it's six digits long that has numbers only between 0 and 9 and letters between ans again some quick validations we want to make sure that that valid hex check passes and also to make sure that the form field is an empty and that the length is not longer than or less than 6 digits or letters long so once it passes the validations we again change the background color of that square div to show a preview of the color and then I passed that hex variable with a hex color code into the color vert function so again it's pretty much the same as the RGB function but the officer around so I have to make the URL first it's a lot simpler for hex obviously because it's just one value as opposed to three so just plug that onto the end of the URL and then put that URL into the fetch API again fetch hits this slash hex to RGB route on the back end it pulls the hex code out from the URL query and stores it in a variable and then it passes that hex variable into the hex to RGB function that comes from the converter file so to convert hex back to RGB what we do is we use pass int so what this does is it takes different sub strings from the hex code string that we have so it takes the first two digits for red the second two digits for green and the third teenagers for set of digits for blue and pass int converts that string back into integers using this reference of base 16 so it knows that it's getting a string that is in basic scene and it can convert it back to a base 10 integer to give us our 0 to 255 values for red green and blue and then it returns ray of the red green and blue values so we stored the result of that RGB or hex RGB conversion in this RGB function variable RGB again if you remember it returns an array of RGB values because it's an array it has to be in a string to be able to be sent back in the HTTP response so we have to use json stringify on this array variable to turn it into a string of an array so that response is sent back in the HTTP response it comes back to the front end so and it pulls again that text out of the object that returns from the fetch request and then we want to pass that JSON object because we json stringify dit to turn it into a string so we want to pass it to turn it from a string back into the array that it originally was so we passed the text into JSON pass and store that in the RGB array variable and then it's as simple as just pulling out the the different indices from the array to equal red green and blue so index 1 0 1 2 4 red green and blue values and then again changing the HTML values on the form on this side of the page and the dip up at the top of the page to reflect the converted RGB values from hex as I just wanted to walk you through how this conversion works how we're making the HTTP calls from the front ends to the back end and then in my next video I'm gonna talk about how the mocha testing works and how you can use testing to make sure that your code works exactly the way that you're expecting it to so I'll put a link to the tutorial that I used on the bottom of this video and also the the github repo as well so thank you for watching bye
