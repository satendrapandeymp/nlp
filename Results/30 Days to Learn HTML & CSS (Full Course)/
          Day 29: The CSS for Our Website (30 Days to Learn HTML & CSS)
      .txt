the next step is to figure out what the width is of the website that was created in Photoshop so we can do this somewhat easily I'm going to select the ruler tool by going right here and choosing ruler or I can press this keyboard shortcut next I'm going to specify the edges right here and if I hold down shift I can limit it to a straight line like so now I'm going to go to the end and it appears in this case that the width is 935 pixels however we're still going to use the 960 framework because there may be some margins involved so let's do that now we're going to go back to 960 gs and download these assets once again if you're not familiar with 960 be sure to go back and watch the episode on it and I'm going to open up these two directories and I'll turn each one side by side and now we're going to go into the code CSS and we're going to copy over the necessary files in this case we're going to copy over the text which is their base text file a reset and then the 960 framework itself now if we want to do both 12 columns and 16 columns we can choose this however if we want to limit it so our file size is smaller we can use this one right here now I will drag those in and we're all set now I'm going to reference them first one that we're linking to is our recent next we're going to reference the text CSS and finally we're going to link to 960 12 call that CSS referenced right here all right if you'd like to self close these you can it doesn't really matter I'm going to save this and now let's reload this in the browser and see what we have okay well because we have applied some base grid class names like container 12 and grid 10 we already have a little bit of formatting and it's starting to look like an actual website but we need to do a little more the first step is let's work from top to bottom we're going to get the header and the navigation area so let's take a look at our PSD again for reference and the navigation is all on one line so let's do that now right here I'm going to create a divider and I've created a snippet I encourage you to do the same and we'll call this and we're going to take all of this information right here and place it in here and that way I can easily browse through my stylesheet a little trick is to also use an equal sign at the beginning and then you can search for equal header and it automatically goes there because otherwise if you just searched for header it's going to bring up every reference the header so that's a nice little trick to know next I'm going to create a divider for our navigation and let's first start by making the list items in line so we'll say nav li display:inline save it and let's come back and now we can see those are being displayed in line but they're right underneath black and white so why don't we float the logo to the left and float the navigation to the right we'll try that float left and navigation will float to the right let's try it out again there we go that's looking better however because we did float we've learned about this because we floated these two elements they've collapsed and that's what's making it look like everything has pushed up so let's come back to our header and let's use the overflow:hidden trick to make sure it contains its floats and that'll push this information down the next step is I want to go ahead and add that black box and that we can see right here so it's just black so we can specify a big width and a large height and it's okay because we can adjust this later within index.html we called it grid two I need a better name and we'll probably say perhaps call-out and you can change this later depending upon what you add there next I'm going to go to the banner and I'm going to put that within a divider as well because that's something I'll probably come back to often there we are and next we'll say call out and that's going to have a background of black and we'll give it a height of 200 pixels for the time being and now notice it should be the exact height of the background image here so I can see that I set it to two thirty one so I'm going to duplicate that as well okay and now we have the height and it looks like the width probably does need to be bigger but we're going to come back to that next I want to get the basic structure in place so let's do the main section as well let's come back to photoshop and it's split into three columns and what we decided was grid five grid five grid two let's come back and ensure that that is in place grid 5 grid 5 grid 2 but remember that it's not showing up correctly and the reason why these aren't taking effect is because we've used the word 2 but actually we should be using the number that makes it a little bit shorter there we are and now let's come back reload and there we are so we've already have a basic layout now all we need to do is add some finesse add some padding and make it look a lot better so the first thing I want to do is get this area a little bit better because grid 2 probably is too small so let's come back and why don't we adjust it right here and right here at the bottom but that's going to make it too wide now because we have 5 5 & 3 is 13 and it's going to fall on its own line so that means this may not be perfect we have grid 4 in grid 4 but there's no way we can get these numbers to be identical without being too low or too high so 4 plus 4 is 8 plus 3 is 11 and that's working down here but then this is taking up more space next I find it's easier for me if I use background color so I can really easily see the dividers in my boxes so we'll do that right now temporarily at the very bottom and we're going to say get the grid fours and those will have a background of red and we're going to get our container so that's container 12 will be green and then finally grid 3 will be a background of orange now let's see and if we reload we can kind of easily see exactly what we're working with so as I am doing this in real time and I don't have notes you get to see how I would do this the first thing I think is there should be some spacing below the banner so let's do that now I'm going to come back and below the banner you can see this main section begins so let's create a new divider for the main section and now I'm going to say main margin top give it some 20 pixels worth of breathing room there we are that pushes that down next I see that the footer has pushed up because this isn't lined up either and now I'm going to say get a new divider for the footer now I'm going to make sure that is clear both as well there we go and that's pushed down much better my next note is I would like some spacing below the logo as well and we have margin right here of top and bottom of ten pixels and left and right of ten pixels and I must admit I don't remember writing that so I might have done that as a mistake because we could just reduce that to 10 pixels even so why don't we keep ten pixels and then ten pixels and then on the bottom will be 20 pixels and the left will lead blank because it's implied that it's ten we reload and now that's been pushed down let's refer back to our Photoshop file I see right here that we sliced out our logo but he does have a plus in it so why don't we try that again select it and now you see it was divided unto two layers so why don't we group those together and if we want we can merge them I can press command E to merge or ctrl E and then do it like we did before select create a new file save it turn off the background save it as a ping 24 and will overwrite the value of logo here we are reload and now we have the plus back okay that was easy the next step is we know that there was a little too much spacing here and the reason is this design doesn't fit perfectly into a 12 column grid as we've seen here because these are both set to one-third which was what would make sense it doesn't line up perfectly so maybe we need a different number of columns now if we come back to the 960 framework if you'll remember there are multiple grids that we can use and if I open this up again I'll go to code CSS and you see that we have 12 columns 24 columns and even 16 columns so that means we need to figure out how this would fit in if we did 16 columns that doesn't divide evenly so that's why it's not quite as common so if we were to divide it into thirds that would be more like five and a third so with that in mind why don't we switch to a 24 column grid because that's going to give us a lot more flexibility and to do that it's really easy I'm going to open up my website and all I do differently is drag in my 24 column grid like so next we delete the old version and then we come back and we rewrite to 960 24 and now let's look at the new classes that we have and it's fairly similar one difference is because we're using a 24 column grid it's still the exact same width but it's a different number I need to update this as well so let's just save that and see how our website is looking now and notice that all of them are much smaller so we need to update these accordingly let's come back to Photoshop and let's measure I'm going to press I to select the measuring tool if yours does not come up you can press shift I a few times still it does and I'm going to zoom in and select the width of what we have right here let's see what I get okay so his is about 340 let's see what we have that's really close to that within here and I can scroll down and look at each one and this looks about right grid nine or so so let's see how we can add up to 24 we have three so if we had nine plus nine is 18 let's add that in right now and we'll do the bottom section grid nine and nine reload and that's pushing those out so 24 minus 18 equals six and let's see how that lines up grid six there we go and I think that's looking a lot cleaner so yes when you're doing it from scratch sometimes you have to change things up if you decide an hour into your project that you need a different grid then do it because it only takes a moment or two to implement next I'm going to do the exact same thing for the banner right here come to the top 18 plus 6 equals 24 there we go and now we're getting a real good looking website alright so I'm going to continue on and I'm going to check the spacing here again and if we want to verify something you can come back to your PSD press Z to zoom in a few clicks now I will press I or select the ruler and I'm just going to measure holding down shift what the distance is and that way I can see what the margin is and it's around 22 pixels so we did that about right when we applied it if we want to adjust this so I can set it to about 22 pixels reload yeah there we go but now here's one problem is at the top the navigation section is a little too high so why don't we reduce that down and for now I'm going to set padding top to 20 pixels and what we want to do here and we're just going to use our eye is we want to line this up perfectly with black and white if you need to see how it lines up in the PSD always refer back to your PSD because you want to be as close as possible and in this case can you see I am right underneath black and white and the navigation section is just a touch above that let's try it and hear by the way on the Mac I'm pressing shift command 4 which is traditionally used to take snapshots but it can also be used to specify widths and use as a ruler of sorts so I need to push up my navigation to twelve there we go next let's work on our navigation section let's see how it looks in the PSD and it's very simple he has grey text and the selected one or the highlighted one presumably if you hover over it is a black or color so if we want to figure out what the color of this is I can choose the text tool and I will select it and then if I come up here it'll automatically be set to the color of that text in this case it's 70 70 70 so let's add that in right now and we'll assume that all anchor tags are set to this color so I'll create a new divider called miscellaneous and set the a color to that and then a hover he had set it to black reload there we are and when I hover over one notice it's now black but in his design the current page is black the selected page is what we call it so you can do that trick by coming back and applying a class and then the current page will always have a class of selected we'll do it right now class equals selected and then we can also apply the hover styling to any class of selected reload and now that's received it but when we hover over something it does as well let's come back though and notice that there is no underline so let's remove that text-decoration:none and of course I should apply that to the generic anchors not the hover State reload there we go next remember hi noted that he used lowercase and I thought that was a stylistic decision we can make it lowercase with our CSS by doing not on our general because it's likely you only want that styling applied to the anchor tags within the navigation presumably so why don't I do nav a to limit it to only anchor tags within the navigation and then I will specify text transform lowercase and now that's been adjusted and we did it all within our CSS hover over each one and that's looking fine let's check out the padding and it looks like the spacing I have is a bit more than he has so we can see what the default is inspect element click on each list item and you can see the default margin left of 30 if we want to reduce this I'm going to press the down arrow and get it more towards what he has which is 22 or if you want to be more specific always bring out that ruler tool zoom in and measure yourself he's got 24 so we'll keep it at 24 pixels and we will update our stylesheet so we'll go back and that's miscellaneous styling so list item all this items will have margin left of 24 pixels I reload okay this is looking a lot better let's see about styling the buttons if we go back to the PSD his are very simple but there is some nice styling there I'm going to proceed to zoom in a few clicks first thing I can see is it's a blackish background so I will select right here and that will bring up an eyedropper tool and then I can bring it over the text click and that will change to the current color so I will select that copy it and now I can use that as the background but how do we target that anchor tag we certainly don't want to apply it to all anchor tags if we come back we remember that we applied a class of button so let's do that as well all button elements will have a background of this color now if I reload there it is but there's not enough spacing so we should use padding for that let's see about how much he used I'm going to get my helpful ruler selected to the end and it looks like about six pixels worth six pixels one more time reload okay that looks pretty good now obviously the default when you hover over an anchor is black that doesn't look good why don't we make it white in this case button hover color white there we go that looks good now it looks like he has also set the text a little bit smaller but we can verify that and we should do that in general what is the default font size I'll select the text tool select some text and then I'll come up right here and now we can see the information he's got a font of Arial and the font size he selected is 13 pixels with a line height of 20 let's add that in right now we can override the text CSS file that was supplied we can add it to text up CSS if we want or if you'd prefer you can work with and your layout and leave that blank in this case because we're within style that CSS most of our time I don't want to confuse you too much so we'll do it right here within our general or you could also have this in a typography section font size 13 pixels line height is going to be 20 pixels notice that we're just going to the Photoshop file getting the values and transferring them over that's all we're doing here reload and now it looks a little bit different but the line height has been increased next what about the default color that's not hard black and it has a color of 35 35 so let's specify that as well all paragraph has a color now if you want that to be the default color across the board you could apply that to the body element but here we're going to limit it to just paragraphs reload and now that's been reduced but what about headings is he keeping the same color as well and once again I'm going to select this text choose the color and it does appear that he's using black as well if we also look here we can see that he has a really high line height set up but we don't want to do that with an HTML because if you're heading does break onto a new line that means every single sentence is going to have that huge spacing so what we should do is add some padding below it instead and it looks like he's also set the letter spacing reduced as well so we will come back let's specify that h1 tags have letter spacing of negative 1 pixel and we're going to set the same thing to h2s and while we're at it if we come back notice that I did use h1 tags here I think that's probably not the best choice I'm going to reduce this to h2 and I think that'll be a little bit cleaner and that's reduced so we need to figure out what the exact size is and also make the text smaller in this case the font size is 26 so I'm going to add that in h2 font size is 26 pixels also we're going to do text transform lowercase there we go that's looking very good the next thing that I see as I'm working through this we're eventually going to get to our banner but at the very top that header is really close to the top so I think I would prefer to have a little breathing room so we can do that right at the top container 24 and we'll give it a March on top let's start with 10 and we're mostly using our I but I think that's cleaner just a little more breathing room good and next let's add the spacing below the headers because notice remember he had a lot of room and then an underline and what color is this underlined I'm going to zoom in really close select the eyedropper tool by pressing I or shift I a couple times if I click it now this color has been selected and that's what I know my dividers should be set to so let's try this out because it might take a little bit of tinkering we'll assume that all h2 tags will receive this styling if you want to limit it to only within the main section you could do that as well border bottom one pixel solid this color and what you'll see when we do this is it's right underneath but we need to stretch that out so if we were to set padding-bottom to 30 pixels you see that gets pushed down quite a bit and that's why you need to come to your file and measure exactly what it needs to be if I select right there it is around 27 and then after it there's some more spacing of around 15 so let's adjust this 27 and the margin will be affected underneath the border like so and now if we come back we can see that that lines up I might have measured a little too high so I will reduce that back down to maybe 24 or maybe 20 you can play around with it I think that looks good though alright and next I want to work on this blockquote in the design he has pretty quotes around it and the text is much larger and it's italic of course I'll select the text and see he has it set to 15 with a line hundred-twenty come back to miscellaneous blockquote and the font size is 15 the line height is 20 pixels and we want to make sure that it is italic text I'll save that and reload and it appears that this is not taking effect so let's see why inspect element and we see we do have that on but the reason it's not taking effect is because the paragraph is overriding the styling of the blockquote so if we want to target that directly we say blockquote and then maybe comma blockquote P and the reason I'm doing this is because that way we get the large font size even if whoever adds more HTML forgets to use a paragraph tag within so it's future-proof now I'll come back reload and there it's taking effect next I would like to add these pretty quotes that you can see right here so first step is select the color bf bf and then we're going to use CSS pseudo-classes because these are stylistic so we'll say blog quote and maybe only the blog quote within the mange section because if you added a blog later they don't want those quotes with every block quote and with that in mind I will take all of this out and bring it into the main section like so now I will make a declaration for before content will be for now a simple double quote let's try that out refresh and see that it's working I'll change it to just lots of letters and now I'm seeing that it's not coming up so that means there is a problem and we get to debug together I want to remove main and let's see if it's working that way and it is so that means there's some problem shouldn't this block quote be a child of main well it should maybe we made a mistake and this is why you validate so we can validate or first see if we can figure it out on our own here's our main section so then we have a grid 9 then we have another grid 9 but then we have this closing div so it looks like we accidentally closed the main section too early so we will indent this and now we have just done a little bit of debugging and hopefully we fixed it and if I reload now it's showing up good so let's change this to a double quote and can you see that it's showing up right there let's style it though and make it really big like so so I'm going to select this text and see what he has he has it 40 pixels tall font size 40 pixels color that shade of grey let's try it again good I want to make the font style italic as well and now we can see it's not quite the same as his and we can look for pretty quotes so I'm going to search for pretty quotes HTML so we'll check this out and here we have some options here and what we need are those pretty quotes so I will copy that and come back and paste that in here instead now we have a curly quote is what you would call it and now that's looking a lot better we need to do the same thing after it as well so main blockquote after and we're going to switch to the closing curly quote next because I don't want to duplicate I'm going to adjust this to main plot quote before and then do the same thing after that way I can group all of this styling into one and I don't have to repeat myself because that can be a big pain if I need to make adjustments and it's also not a good practice there we go so let's try this again reload looking better but we know that this should be put on the right as you can see right here so let's adjust the float right reload there we go let's come back and see what else we can do the color should be different it's not that grayish color it looks like he's using almost black notice the subtlety in different colors here so I'll set the color of all text within block quotes at the top right here to that value reload that's looking better and if i zoom out I'll get a better angle and I'm going to go back and forth it looks like the beginning quote is right before the text it's not on its own line and the same thing for the closing quote but that's not what we have now the reason this is happening is because we're applying this content before the block quote but not before the paragraph so that's where you're getting that spacing so one way we can fix this is to apply this before the first paragraph if I just do this what it's going to do is apply this content before every single paragraph and if you have multiple paragraphs within a block quote that's going to look really odd so instead I'm going to limit this to the first paragraph and that way this styling only gets applied however in this case this is the closing so I'm going to change that to last and this one to first child get the first paragraph within the block quote and add it and that way it should look a lot better now we're not getting the styling anymore because we have to adjust it here as well like so reload and now that's looking better but still we need some more spacing so you'll know little simple things like this you could use a background if you want but sometimes they you need to spend a little bit of time with them in this case I'm going to add some padding left to the text itself once again we're going to limit this only to the block quotes within that main section and if we do padding left and let's do a big number so you can see exactly what's happening that's pushing the text over but it's also going to put the quote over but watch what happens if we get the quote right here and we set the position to absolute and we push it in the top left portion of that area what you're seeing is it's disappeared but it hasn't disappeared it's gone all the way to the top right here and you've learned about this in our positioning tutorial that's happening because we have not specified a positioning context so it's using the body or the window as its context we can limit this though by always specifying in your block quotes a position of relative and now can you see because we specified that it is now limited to that section and we are able to add that padding good now we're starting to get it let's scroll back down and I think that padding left is too much let's reduce it to 30 there we go and I also want to push it down just a touch so right here rather than top let's do top 5 pixels and you might want to play around with it just a touch maybe 7 okay so we have the left section right the right section should be on the last line position absolute bottom zero and right zero now I would presume it's not going to change as you can see right here and it's because it's already in the bottom right spot so we just need to push it even lower so I can use a negative number negative five pixels and that looks a lot better maybe seven once again so what we should do is test this and test it by adding another quote right here and if we did everything right it should still display nicely reload and there you go you have the beginning quote at the top in the closing quote at the bottom so it did take some trickery you could use backgrounds if you want but I like to use CSS whenever possible let's get rid of that and now we're done with that section okay and we're about ready to get onto this banner the last thing is I want to make sure everything lines up nicely and next we're about to get to styling this banner right up here but what thing is that you always want to make sure your lines are nice and clean so we should make sure that the top of these headings the beginning of the main section is consistent all the way through but it's not notice how the block quote is just a little taller and even though that doesn't seem like a big deal it actually is so we can adjust this and what's causing this is either margin or line height if I hover over it can you see that the bounding box there's actually a good bit of spacing above the heading now we can see that there is no margin applied you can go to compute it to double check no margin applied at all so that means it's line height and the line height can add a little bit of spacing if I were to set that to one M which is the default for a heading two can you see how it pushed up and now if we want to double check that we did it right right here that should line up with the top and can you see it does so let's fix this and we're going to go up to h2 tags and make sure that we specify that the line height should be one N and now we've made a subtle change but that really adds up I promise you and everything is lining up nicely we'll do this side as well that lines up okay good so now you have a good working website we just need to do a little bit more for this lesson you've stuck around for a really long time so congratulations let's get this banner text done do a little bit of the footer and then we're done for today and you can put up your feet so let's go back to the Photoshop file zoom out and can you see that right now the text is white with a background so if you ever feel overwhelmed and you think I don't know the beginning of how to do this one step at a time first we specify the color so it's telling me right here I don't have that font installed that's okay but the color is set to white and the font size is 28 and he has the letter spacing reduced ever so slightly so we can do that right now let's go back to index.html and with n our banner section at the very top this is a heading so why don't we make that an h2 you could also experiment with making these h3 tags you just want to create the proper hierarchy and you may need to go back and adjust it later for now I'll keep them all at h2s but then remember it is going to receive any styling that we've already applied as you can see right there so now I'm thinking why don't we come back and we're going to adjust all h2s so I'm going to select h2 and on the Mac I can do a quick search and replace by pressing ctrl command G and we're going to change all of those occurrences to h3 and then right up here I will make just this section in h2 and that way I'm not receiving that styling and then I can come back here and adjust things so now we're only targeting h3 s with that text and now these will stay the same but this is reduced to whatever is set by default we'll scroll down a little bit more and see if there's anything else we need to change and while I'm thinking of it let's go ahead and get rid of those background colors that we set right here could we don't need those anymore we know what we're doing okay so now let's specify the colors so within here banner h2 the color is going to be white the font size is set to 28 pixels that looks a lot better and now we know we don't want the width to be too high as you can see here he doesn't even have the font set to bold and he is using a special font so if you needed to you could also use a custom font or you could use a background image it's just up to you I like to use as much HTML as when possible but generally you may want to use a custom font and you can look at font squirrel or google fonts for that so for now we're going to specify in maximum width for this section and we can see it's roughly around 400 pixels so
