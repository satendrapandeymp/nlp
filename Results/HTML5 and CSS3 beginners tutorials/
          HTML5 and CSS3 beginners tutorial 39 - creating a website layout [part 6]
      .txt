hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and I'm back and I'm here to finish the series so I know I haven't uploaded any videos in almost a month and a lot of you guys have actually been waiting for me to finish this series so I do want to apologize for being absent from YouTube for so long and yeah I'm back let's go ahead and finish the series now so this is tutorial number 39 and we're taking a look at part 6 of our basic website layout ok so in the previous tutorial we left off and I said that we were going to continue floating this section and this aside tag next to each other so if we take a look at this in the browser right now you guys will know that we've already taken care of our navigation and our logo but we have our main section over here and our aside section appearing below each other so let's go ahead now and actually take care of this and let's get them floated next to each other so to do that I'm going to go ahead and give my section a class so we're going to give that a class of left side because it's going to be on the left and we're going to give the side a class of right side because that's going to appear on the right and while we're at it I'm going to go down to this footer over here and I'm going to give this a class of page footer whoops and I know a lot of you guys are probably wondering like what the heck why are you giving the footer a class now and you know it'll all become apparent in just a second but let's get started with this section and this aside tag so let's actually float them to the left so we'll float the section to the left and then we'll float the aside section to the left which means that they will be appearing next to each other okay so I've already made a comment over here which is floats aside and main section so that's what we're going to do and we're going to do that using the actual classes so I'm going to float the left side first and we're going to go ahead and say float left and then after that we're going to go ahead and float the right side under school not - oops okay right side and we're going to float that to the left as well now I could go ahead and float this right side to the right it probably wouldn't make much difference but I like to float everything to the left just so I know that there's no space in between our left side and our right side like we don't have any unnecessary space they're going to be floated right next to each other pushed up you know touching each other basically so let's go over to Firefox and click refresh and as you can see things look a little bit funny now because yes we have our main section over here and we've got our side section next to our main section but what the heck is the footer doing up here okay and that is because we actually have this floated to the left and then we have our aside floated to the left so these two are appearing next to each other because they're floated but then our footer is actually wrapping around any floated content which you know makes it appear up here because there's enough space for it to appear here okay so the first thing we want to do is go over to our footer and or I'm going to go ahead and just make comments here and we're just going to say make footer clear floated elements okay and then I'm going to grab that footer by its class name which was page footer I hope that's exactly what I named it let's go see yeah that's pretty much it okay and we're just going to say clear both now because both of these are floated to the left I probably could just say clear left but you know just in case any of you guys want to float this to the right let's just clear both so go ahead and save that now and click refresh and our footer is now back where it should be at the bottom of the page okay but how do we get these two blocks over here these two elements our section and our aside to appear correctly because you know right now they're right up against each other and you know this isn't taking up very much space at all if I came here as a user I wouldn't really know that this is the main content of the web page like that this is what I was looking for okay so let's go over to CSS and we're going to give things some width okay so the first thing I'm going to do is actually make my left side bigger than the right side because obviously you know our left side being the main content of the web page might actually you know be a lot bigger than what I've got here in this example and in fact that means it would take up much more space so it probably needs a lot more space and again you know having a bigger left side is just going to make sure that that is what attracts the users attention the big left side or all the information in that left side so let's go ahead and give that a width now and I'm going to give that a width of 700 pixels but if we scroll all the way to the top of our CSS file over here you can see that we've also got our container that has a width of 1000 pixels and since our left side and our right side are actually inside of that container we have to stick to that width so that means that if our left side is going to be 700 pixels our right side needs to be small enough to actually fit in that space okay all the leftover space and 1000 minus 700 is 300 pixels so I could go ahead and give this a width of 300 pixels and that means that our 700 plus 300 fits perfectly into our 1000 pixel container and when we go ahead and click refresh now we should get our main section appearing here you know basically where it should be and that takes up 700 pixels starting from here and ending over here and then our aside section takes up the remaining 300 pixels in the actual block and if you guys want to check this out you could go ahead and right-click on your page somewhere click inspect elements and right now we're in the container so we can see our container has a width of 1000 pixels or actually that's our footer there's our container okay and if we go ahead and take a look at the section over here take a note for the dotted lines that are going to appear as soon as I hover over here you can see that our section takes up 700 pixels so you can take a look at that over here and our aside while that takes up 300 pixels by 159 pixels and that 159 pixels is just the height which is defined by how much content we have in there okay but now we've got this main section here and there's a side section what happens if we decided to give them a margin or a padding or a border or something like that well that's going to throw our calculations way out so let's go ahead and actually just give this a border of 2 pixels so red and I'm going to give my right side a border as well so let's just copy that and paste this but instead we'll give that a blue border okay so we've got a red border and a blue border spider-man colors for the win let's go ahead and click refresh well what the heck didn't we just float our side section and our main section next to each other why are they been looked below each other again like what the heck is going on and the reason for this is because if we go back to CSS over here you'll see that we have 700 pixels as a width but then we've got a 2 pixel border and this is 2 pixels on the left and 2 pixels on the right okay and again if we take a look at this right side we've got a 300 pixel width width two pixels on the left as a border and two pixels on the right as a border and 700 plus 2 pixels on the left is 702 plus 2 pixels on the right that's 704 and if you take a look at this this is 300 pixels plus 2 pixels on the left and 2 pixels or not so that's 304 so that means we have a total of 1000 and 8 pixels and our container over here only has a width of 1000 pixels so we're kind of over by 8 pixels okay and one way to fix this would be just to subtract that amount of space that the board is going to take away from the actual width so I could say that my width must be 696 pixels and let's go ahead and change the width of this right side as well because that's going to have to be 296 pixels okay and if you go ahead and save that now and click refresh we've got these two blocks or the main section and the aside section appearing next to each other again which is exactly what we wanted in the first place but as you can see we don't really have any space between these two blocks there's no margin so if we wanted to go ahead and add a margin in here I'm going to add mine to the left side and we're just going to give this a margin on the right so margin right of 10 pixels okay the reason why I did that is because I want 10 pixels of space on the right of my left side which means that there should be 10 pixels of space here but let's click refresh and again we've stuffed up because this section of yellow this aside section has now fallen down to the bottom over here and that's because we're over the total width again okay so since I added a 10 pixel margin I'm going to have to add subtract those 10 pixels from somewhere so I could go ahead and actually just take it out of the width of this left side over here so I could make this 686 pixels and again that's going to make these two blocks fit next to each other perfectly again so let's click refresh and as you can see they're perfectly spaced out next to each other with a 10 pixel margin in between them but again there isn't really much padding between these two articles so like our words are pushed up right against the border there's no padding in this actual section so if I wanted to add padding to this section well you know then I'm going to have to factor that in as well but I'm actually not going to do that because we're running out of time but you know just to let you guys know that you could do it that way and I'm also going to show you guys a completely different way to take care of this problem in the next tutorial so make sure you come back and watch that and I'm going to show you guys completely different approach to looking at this problem so I'll see you guys in the next video you
