welcome to the introductory video on beginning JavaScript and this is part of our ongoing web development series now in terms of prerequisites if you have no previous experience with HTML or CSS you should go to my youtube channel page and take the beginning tutorials on both HTML and CSS because they kind of go hand-in-hand with JavaScript now in terms of what you'll need any text editor will do but I will be using notepad in this series but again you can use any text editor now HTML CSS and JavaScript I like to call those the big three they work hand-in-hand to produce an interactive website HTML of course add structure to our webpages so items such as layout sections and paragraph that makes up our website and really gives it an overall structure we use CSS to style our HTML tags and so that adds style to our webpages so items such as color borders all those types of things at all the pizzazz to our website and then Java Script adds programing to our webpages and that really makes our webpages interactive it allows our webpages to be dynamic and to respond to user input and so we'll go over all that in this entire series now how is JavaScript different from other programming languages well the big difference is we don't have to compile our code and we also don't need an IDE so we can just place the JavaScript code right in our web page and then the browser executes it now where do we place our JavaScript code we place the JavaScript code in the script element tag within our HTML web page and of course the script element tag is placed within the head element tag and we'll be going over that in the next video so we're not actually going to do any coding in this introductory video we'll get to that in the next video oh and one more thing I will be dividing this series into two parts in the first part we'll be exploring the concepts of JavaScript and in the second part we'll apply those concepts to an actual website probably the website that we developed in the CSS layout tutorials ok see you guys in the next video
