how's it going it's Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 23 and in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to work with pseudo elements in HTML so in the previous tutorial we looked at pseudo classes which are very similar and in fact a lot of people might think pseudo elements are exactly the same thing because they kind of are except a pseudo class is kind of a class that doesn't exist whereas a pseudo element is more of an element than it is just a specific class right so let's create a paragraph and I'm gonna put some lorem ipsum in here so I'm going to type and lorem and then I'm gonna hit tab and if you're using sublime this should happen it should add in a full paragraph of lorem ipsum right if it doesn't work try googling it maybe it is different on Windows then Mac alright so here we have a paragraph and what I want to do now is style this so let's take a look at this and the browser real quick and it is you know quite a long paragraph I'm just gonna zoom in to make that a little bit more clear and let's style our paragraph but I'm gonna style a pseudo element in this paragraph so I'm going to select the first letter so that is an element if you think about it this letter it exists it's there on the screen and I can select it as a letter or trend but treat it as an element therefore that's why we say it is a pseudo element than not a class right and I'm going to give this a font size of 200% which will make it twice as big as the other text in the paragraph and then I'm also going to change the color to blue or whatever color you want to do let's hit refresh and now you can see we've got this really big L it's you know it's twice the size of it or the other text on the page and it's also blue so we can treat this first letter as if it were in element all right we can also do the same thing with the first line of this paragraph so let's come back here and hit refresh and now it selects the entire first line and it applies the same styling so we've got the font size and the the color changing there nice thing about that is it will automatically detect how long the line is and just make that first line or apply that styling to the first line right so if i zoom out a little bit you can see the line got longer and so all of that text also changed to blue as well if i zoom in the line gets a little bit shorter and all of that text and changes and the text that moved out the new line you know loses that styling alright so there we go we've done that now let's take a look at the next selector I want to show you guys which is before and after so let's go for before and I'll just remove that styling but what the before element allows us to do is add some text before our paragraph so let me go ahead and just remove everything except maybe this first sentence so the paragraphs are lot shorter to work with and now we have this this paragraph here but I want to add some text before or something before right then I can use the paragraph selector selected before elements and then add in some styling so I'm going to add in content and I'm going to add maybe just the word sum or something right and that allows us to add content before our text but this has been put in with CSS so you'll notice that I can select normal text like this but if I try to select the something I can't select it it's it's been put in there with CSS it's almost treated as if it were an image or something rather than text so this can be used if you ever want to put a little bit of content in before a prior paragraph and you can do the same thing for after so you can put the text in after a paragraph and now we have something at the end of the paragraph but I think for the most part people generally put in like a full stop and then they usually use this to clear whenever we do float and clear which we'll probably do in a previous tutorial or in a future tutorial in a previous tutorial and it is also useful for sometimes putting in icons so let me just say before and I'll just use this for now seeing as we're not linking to any icons but you'll see I get to put this little hash symbol in on a hash but what is this thing called a dash before the paragraph and if I have obviously a few paragraphs then they all get that - save come back here refresh so they all get that little dash before them and they almost look like a little bit of a list and in future when I show you guys how to add your own custom fonts and things like that to your HTML documents you can add in your own icon over here and then icon will appear before the text as well I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at their Mountain they run a coding boot camp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that while you're still here there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
