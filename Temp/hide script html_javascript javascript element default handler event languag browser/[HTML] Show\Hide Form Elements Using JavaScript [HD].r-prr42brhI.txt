hello youtube today I'll be showing you how to show and hide display or form elements using javascript now let's start off in our HTML editor here I'm using Komodo it's a free open source editor if you get Komodo edit there's also the Komodo IDE that is a trial or pay for but today we'll be using Komodo edit because that works just fine for html5 editing so let's go to file let's create a new file from template and I like this to create an html5 document so I'll hit open and here we have our simple HTML document let's call this show/hide with GS and here we have the body of our HTML document so let's start off building our form so in order to create an HTML form we have to first open our form tags and we'll set its action or when its method is sent it's going to go to this URL so we're just gonna have it do nothing currently and it automatically closes off our form tag so now let's create an input box so what we'll do is we'll have an input of type text sorry check box because we're gonna have a checkbox that allows us to click the check box and then it'll show and hide the rest of our form just like you would have a certain form that would only show certain data fields so now if we go ahead and it'll prompt to save this so I'll just go ahead and see what I might die that's top save it right in here and we'll preview this and this is Komodo just asking and here we have our check box now it doesn't do anything currently because we haven't linked it to anything so let's also set up some other things like the name plus set this equal to check and the ID set to check now with this input box we might want some description text so we're gonna do is create a label and we're gonna use a for attribute to set it equal to chk which is our check box and it has to be the ID so if this name would this name can be something different here let's name it check box it'll still link because it has to link to the ID now let's close our label and let's say click to show or hide and let's view this and here we can see when we hover over our label it automatically gives us this check box hover effect that way you can hover over it and click it just fine okay so now that we have that down let's actually write the rest of our form so what we need is a newline the reason I created a new line here and we'll make an input so we'll just make this a simple name and email form so we'll do type of text and name name and then let's give it a class called hidden and we'll close off the rest of this year close this off just that way and then we'll have a label and this can just say something like the name it doesn't have to have the four attribute because it'll be something simple will create another break and another label so we can go ahead and copy this and we'll just say email here name email and the same class so let's view and now we can see underneath our check box we have our name and email input boxes so what we want to have using these classes we're going to have our class set to display if none that way they won't be displayed so up here in our head we're gonna create some simple CSS so we'll open the style braces and we'll call this top hidden and die hidden is our selector it'll select that class and we'll see display:none now when you view this our input boxes have gone away however our labels of not so we'll just add these to the hidden class real time and we can copy and paste this into the label and now our labels are gone so that that's working out just fine and what we're gonna use is JavaScript to toggle between this being display of block and this being display of none so now what JavaScript does is allow us to use events to trigger JavaScript code so on the specific event of on click we're gonna call some code called show hi and actually that H should be capitalized and now let's create our JavaScript so up here we're going to create a script of type text/javascript just close off that and now we want to define a function called just like we have here show/hide and it'll take no parameters that's with the parentheses and said the parentheses would be our parameters but we are sending them and in our show/hide where we're going to have to do is define two variables so variable one will be our checkbox and that'll be equal to our documents or our page that get element by ID and this is why we define that ID earlier this idea of check we're just going to go ahead and put in some quotations and paste that in so now that will define our check box and we'll do another variable of hidden inputs and that'll be equal to document dot get elements by class name and then just as before it will be hidden in here because that's our class right here so now let's have an if statement so we'll have an if and what we're gonna check is we're gonna see if that checkbox is checked so if checkbox check so if that's true because this is the same as putting true so you can just leave out the true part and then we'll open our brace and we're going to say that hidden inputs that now what we have to have here is our hidden inputs variable that's actually an array created because we hate we can have multiple elements using that class name so what we're gonna have to do is iterate through that array so what we could even do is have our for loop defined right here so let's have our for loop and study here open it up and form will run while condition is true so let's create a variable called I will set that equal to zero we'll run a while hi is not equal to hidden inputs that length and length is how many items in that array and then I will iterate by one each Mary so now we can have her if statement so let's see if checkbox died to check so if that's true then it's going to take our hidden inputs dot style sorry with art I iterator in there because that'll select that element in that array that's style that display and then that will be equal to block so that will set our hidden inputs and it'll basically come up into our CSS here and I'll set our display equal to block from none so we can go ahead and test this right now so when you click it you can then see that its display property is set to block so now the thing is if we go back and preview that we click it and then we uncheck it we can see that when we uncheck it the stuff doesn't go away so that could be quite problematic so what we also need is an else and we're going to do hidden inputs with our I again that's style that display equal to none and now when we run this you can see that when we click it once it displays and I'm gonna click it again it goes away that's because it's also running this if it's already checked and this says for warning we can change this display here so it shows up as different things in line would probably look the best there's block is also another one that will work but this is how you show and hide form elements using JavaScript and a couple of if statements so if you liked this video
