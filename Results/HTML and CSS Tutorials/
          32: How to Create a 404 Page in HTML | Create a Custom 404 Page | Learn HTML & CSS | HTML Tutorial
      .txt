how's it going everyone welcome back to next episode on how to create HTML and CSS now in this episode you're gonna learn how to create a 404 page for a website and this Aksum a second time trying to record this episode because in my last attempt my audio got distorted when I listened to it afterwards so I had to rerecord everything so hopefully now everything should be fine so a 404 page in case you don't know is a page that you're taking to inside a website if you try to access a page that does not exist inside the website now there's a couple of ways you can accidentally access these pages such as going to the URL and write something like if it were to go to this website for example called cry outdoors if it were to go to the URL and say forward slash blah blah blah enter then you can see we're taking to a 404 page not found and then you can then get some kind of message like continue shopping or something that you can give the user when they visit your website and access a page they're not supposed to find oh that doesn't really exist inside the website so another example if I were to go to youtube and go behind USSOCOM for slash blah blah blah is that we get this page it doesn't really say 404 but it is still a 404 page that says well this page is trying to access doesn't exist therefore try doing this instead so what we're going to do is we're going to learn how to create this 404 page for our own website and as you can see this is the website that we've been creating in this course many episodes ago and inside this website we created we didn't create a 404 page so if we were to go to the URL a mentor net forward slash blah blah blah you can see that we get this not found really boring looking page inside the website so if we do not have a 404 page inside our root folder and we haven't told the server that we had this page then you're going to get this really boring screen that doesn't look like it's part of your website like cry out doors you can still see the men using us to still see all different links that we have inside the website but inside my website you can't see anything other than not found so we want to create this special page that people land on if they tried to access a page that does not exist and I'm pretty sure that everyone watching this video at some point has hit a 404 page not found at some point when you visit the internet because it's a pretty normal thing to accidentally try to get to so we need to make sure that when people visit your website there is going to be a 404 page because there's probably gonna be people I sound like that sometimes one must be too fast English because it's not my main language so but you should have a 404 page when people visit your website because people will hit it at some point so now there's a couple of things that we need to create when creating this 404 page for the website that we have the first thing is that you need to actually create a 404 page using HTML and CSS now in my last attempt to create this episode I did actually create a 404 page so I'm just gonna go ahead and grab it here as you can see I created a page that I called not - found - page HTML and again you can call it whatever you want it doesn't have to be not found pierced at HTML it could also be for of word - page not found that HTML it doesn't really matter there isn't a specific name you need to give this page you just need to give it a name that makes sense when it comes to a 404 page so once you created this page you of course need to style it and do all the things you need to do in order to create a basic page inside a website again this is basic HTML and CSS so we're not going to do a huge tutorial on how to do this using HTML and CSS because like I said it's a pretty pretty easy thing and a pretty normal thing to do you know using what we learned so far in this course here so as you can see this is just a regular page all I did was I included a 404 page title and a paragraph that says what you know what do we're looking for does not exist go back to the front page by clicking this specific link here and I can actually do like that there you go so what I want to do is I want to upload this website or not this website but this page to my online website so I have FileZilla here in case you use FileZilla you can open I open that up too and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this page that I created and I'm going to upload it to my server which is online now what is going to happen is if I were to go and try this out so if we were to go here for slash blah blah blah you can see it doesn't really access the page and all I really did was I created a copy of another page in here and it just simply said 404 page not found blah blah blah but we can't see it inside the website when we try to access it so why is this well right now we need to tell the server which our website is is sitting on that if we were to hit a page that we do not have access to inside the server then it needs to redirect the user to a specific file inside our server so what I need to do is I need to go inside my editor my my text editor and create a new file and I'm going to save it as punctuation HT access and it's very important we call it this specific name and not anything else so it has to be dot 8t axes and I know that usually when we have punctuation something it's an extension we create a file like index.html or style dot CSS but in this case it's just going to be punctuation as the first thing and then htaccess okay now what an htaccess file is is a configuration file for your server so as long as we have a Apache web server on the internet then we can create an HT access file in order to make changes to the server as you try to load the website so what we can do in here is we can tell the server that before you run the website make sure you check for a not found page or a 404 page to make sure that if the user were trying to access any kind of page inside the website that does not exist then they should have this page shown to them so inside this htaccess file we just need to create one line of code so I'm going to say we have something called a error document with a big e and a big deep in one word and the error document that we have is going to be a 404 type there we go then I need to tell the document of the server where this document is sitting at that we want to show the user as soon as they enter the website in a wrong page so what I can do is I can say /not - found - page dot HTML and save it and that's everything needs to include inside this specific document you're inside this file here so if we were to go back inside FileZilla and load up my HT Access file that I just saved and insert it inside the main directory of my website which is the main directive main directory of the server then if I were to go back inside the browser where I have my website go back refresh and then go into the URL say Amen to net blah blah blah then you can see we get this 404 page not found inside my website so this is how we can create a 404 page not found in a very easy way and I know I talked about something called a configuration file in this episode which is the htaccess file which is created don't worry too much about specifically what we can do with the htaccess file for now later on I will have more tutorials on what exact if you can use this for inside a website so for now just know that for this specific function here of creating a 404 page you need to write write one line of code inside the htaccess file and just upload it to your server and that's it so I hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you next time [Music]
