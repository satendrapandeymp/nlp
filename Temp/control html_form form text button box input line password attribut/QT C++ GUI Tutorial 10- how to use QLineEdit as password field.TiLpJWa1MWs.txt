hello guys welcome on Seguin in the last video I have shown you how to make a simple login application with your QT GUI application and SQLite database so when you enter some u username or and password and when you press this login button it will give you the message if the username and password is correct or not but if you have noticed in the last video or if you notice right now that in the password whatever I type it is displays this it is displayed as it is but in the real life scenario it should not be like this it should be some dots or some some some specific character which the other people should not be able to recognize right so password your past must password must be protected from the outside world so in this video I will just show you how you can protect your password like that right now when you enter some text it looks like this so it's a very easy procedure just close my project and what I will do is I will select my password line add it just select it and just go to the properties here and then drag this property scroll and go to cue line edit section and in here go to eco mode so go here and it's by default is normal what you need to do is just make it password so make this eco mode as password and now I will run my program it will ask me to save and it will build and it's running now and now when I enter some username for example username and when I enter the password you see here it's not displayed instead of this this password character comes okay so now your password is protected from the outside world so in this video I just wanted to show you how you can protect your password like this so stay tuned and please rate comment and subscribe and bye for now
