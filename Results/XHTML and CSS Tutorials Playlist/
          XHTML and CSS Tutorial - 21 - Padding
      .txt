welcome back guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 21st XHTML and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to introduce a concept with CSS that tends give people a lot of trouble and the reason for this is that people tend to explain this in it's not the most easiest concept to grasp but it is critical whenever you're creating a website and you need to position elements exactly how you want them so anyone I ever heard that try to explain this to me did a pretty terrible job so I'm going to try and clear everything up for you so whenever you have an element on your screen like a header let's go ahead and put a header too and that's right I love Bucky that's good enough I love Bucky and let's go ahead and check this out right now whenever we have any element basically on the screen we look at this element and say oh this nice um you know text on the screen that's all I see but check it out and here's where I'm going to throw you for a loop this one element actually consists of four different parts now we already know that the text and that is called the content but what you don't see is if three other parts and that's because they're all white right now so they're kind of hard to see but there's actually the content which I just showed you was a text the padding which we're going to be going over this tutorial in the padding is basically this see this blue that I just highlighted and everything turned blue well if you could go ahead and draw a box around here and make a border the padding would be the space between the text in the border and that brings me to the third part which is actually the border and the margin is a space outside the border so anyways the space between the text itself and this little line the border that is called the padding and that is what I'm going to show you guys in this tutorial so let's go ahead and the first thing that we need to do is change this from a white padding to a white background because how the heck are we going to be able to what's going on there so the first thing that we need to do is change the background color so in order to do that go ahead and type the element you want to work with h2 and let's just go ahead put background color and don't want something too dark because of black on something dark um is just going to look bad so put like something like yellow or pink or orange maybe um so I'm going to go ahead and put yellow and let's save this and see what we got so now that might be a little easier to see the you know some background other than white so now we can see that we have our content and we don't have a whole lot of space between the edge of this yellow and the text it's pretty much butted up right up against the edge so every saying all right I have this background but I basically want to add some padding between the text and the background so in order to do that I mean you guys can probably figure out what's going to happen right now but you can either do this in one of two ways you can either change the overall padding by typing the keyword padding and setting it equal to value like 20 pixels so let's go ahead and save this and see what happens whenever we refresh this you see that we get a nice little pad between our text and the edge of our border and that is actually 20 pixels on either side 20 pixels on bottom 20 pixels on top 20 pixels on left and 20 pixels on right even though there's like 100 pixels because it's the width of the screen but anyways 20 pixels of padding all the way around but now you're saying all right I mean so right now you can basically understand what padding is it's a space between the text and the border of whatever you're working with but I saying all right I understand padding simple enough but now what I want to do is I want padding but I don't want it all the way around maybe you only want padding on the top and bottom well in order to do that this isn't going to work anymore because this gives you padding all the way around in order to change the padding in any one direction they give you four key words that you can use padding top padding bottom padding left and padding all right so let's go ahead and change it on top and bottom padding - top definitely spread that ring padding-top let's go ahead and add a like uh 30 pixels and for the padding bottom let's go ahead and and like I don't know 20 pick anything you want who the heck cares and let's go ahead and make sure you put pixels and save this and see what happens so now when we refresh this we see I forgot my values already 30 and 20 we got 30 pixels of padding on top and 20 pixels of padding on bottom and no padding to the left so maybe when I do this you can see more clear what is padding and why is helpful so anyways whenever you want us um how should I say this place items on your website very specifically padding comes into play a lot so whenever you know you just want that header but just a couple pictures to the right that is when you can use padding so anyways the next thing I'm going to talk to you guys about is borders and margins and they're a lot different than padding although a lot of people get them confused so don't forget to watch my next couple tutorials and that's it I'll see you guys later
