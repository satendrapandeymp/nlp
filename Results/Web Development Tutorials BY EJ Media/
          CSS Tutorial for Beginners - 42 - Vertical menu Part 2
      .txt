so in the last video we developed our vertical menu here in this video we're going to add a hover effect to our menu so that when we hover over our links the color will change now the way this works is if you have a darker color you want to use a lighter color when the user hovers over the link that will provide a nice contrast and let the user know that they are in fact over that particular link so again if you have a darker color you want to use a lighter color for the hover and vice-versa so if our link was a lighter color like a lighter green here we would use a darker color for the hover so several videos ago we talked about States and you will remember that I said that if you use effects we actually have to use a different rule set for those effects so when we create our hover effect we're going to create another rule set now it's pretty much the same as this rule set we're just going to add the hover attribute to our anchor selector and so again we use a colon and we just type in hover and of course the first thing we want to do is switch the color to a lighter color now this hex code D 3 D 3 d3 creates a light gray and this is kind of a standard color that's used on a lot of menus so let's go ahead and save our style sheet and we'll refresh our page and there you can see now we get this nice contrast from a dark green to a light gray and again that lets the user know that they are hovered over a particular link but we have one problem here and that is this white text does not stand out well against our light gray now it stands out fine against the dark green but not against our light gray so let's go ahead and change that and we will change that to a black color for our text so let's go ahead and save our stylesheet and if we hit refresh here and now you can see we get black text against our light gray and that stands out much better and so this is looking pretty good now now in the next video we're going to move on to horizontal menus and then we're going to actually start working with drop down menus so I will see you guys in the next video
