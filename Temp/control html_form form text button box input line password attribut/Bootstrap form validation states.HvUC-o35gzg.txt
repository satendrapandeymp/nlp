this is part 23 of bootstrap tutorial in this video we'll discuss how to style the form controls based on the validation state here we have the list of classes and glyph icons for styling the form controls based on the validation state for success validation state we have has success class similarly for warning and error validation States we have has warning and has error classes respectively we also have the cliff icons for these three validation States let's look at an example now so here is what we want to do when you register for an online account you are required to type in a password when you type in a strong password you might have seen controls Skylar like this look at the label which says password the border around the textbox and this help text strong password all of them are in green in color so here the controls are styled for success validation state let's see how to achieve this using bootstrap at the moment we have the label which says password and a text box to capture the password and here is the HTML required for that here we have a horizontal form inside that we have a development with class form group and inside that we have a label for password and that label is two units wide and then a development which is ten units wide inside the development we have a textbox to capture the password at the moment we are not displaying this help text that says strong password to display that I'm going to use a span element with class set to help block we use this class to display the help text associated with a form control and in this case the help text is going to be strong password let's save our changes and when we reload this page we should see that help text associated with the form control now we want to style these form controls for success validation state to achieve that all we have to do is on the parent development right here use has success class let's save our changes and when we reload this page notice now how the controls are styled for success validation state now let's discuss how to style the form controls for warning validation state for example if we type in a weak password this is how we want our form controls to be styled let's look at this in action let's make a copy of this form group that we have here and the help text is going to say weak password and instead of using hash success class I'm going to use has one in class let's save our changes and when we reload this page notice now these controls are styled for one in validation state let's now discuss styling form controls for error validation State let's say for example we have a form field that expects an integer for example an age field like this in his field if we type alphabets instead of numbers we want to style these form controls for error validation state let's see how to achieve this let's flip to visual studio let's make a copy of this form group the label should be age let's use input type text instead of input type password the help text below that should be invalid age and now to style these controls for error validation state instead of using has one in class we are going to use has error class let's save our changes and when we reload this page notice now the form controls are styled for error validation state the colors that we get depends on the bootstrap validation class that we are using in addition to these classes we can also use these glyph icons with the three validation States that we have let's see how to use these icons with different validation States so here is what we want to do depending on the validation state we want to display these different icons these are glyph icons and you can find these icons right here get bootstrap com4 slash compound with success validation state this is the icon that we want to use with error validation state this is the icon and with warning validation state this is the icon let's look at the steps involved if you look at where we want these icons we want them right inside the form controls themselves so immediately next to the input element I'm going to use a span element and the class for this is going to be the name of the glyph icon with success validation state we want to use glyph icon glyph icon okay so this icon is going to display that little tick mark for us in addition to the glyph I can name we also have to use a class here and that is form control feedback class and on this development right here which has the form group and has success classes we have to use another class and that is has feedback class let's do these changes for the other two developments so on the second development let's use has feedback class on the third one as well and then let's use this span element with this input element so with warning validation state we want to display a different icon and that is glyph icon warning sign and let's do the same thing with the last development here so next to the age text box let's face the span element and with error validation state we want to use a different icon and that is glyph I can remove which is going to display that little cross let's save our changes and when we reload our page notice we get the icons as expected finally let's discuss styling input groups here we have an input group notice next to the text box there is a dollar symbol appended to it so this dollar symbol and this text box are inside an input group styling input groups is very similar to styling the other form controls that we have seen so far fur let's create this input group so let's flip to visual studio I'm going to place this text box inside an input group first let's create an input group to create an input group I'm going to create a development with class set to input group and then let's move this text box inside that development now to this text box we want to append the dollar symbol for that I'm going to use span element and then the class for this is going to be input group add-on and what we want to append to this input element is a dollar symbol so I'm going to place the dollar symbol inside that span element so this is going to give us an input group consisting of this dollar symbol and this text box and for completeness I'm going to change this label to income because we are displaying a dollar and the placeholder is going to say you are annual income and let's get rid of the other developments that we have here let's save our changes and when we reload the page notice we get an input group that is styled for success validation state now if you want to style input groups for warning and error validation States all you have to do is use different classes and different glyph icons thank you for listening and have a great day
