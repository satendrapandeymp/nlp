we're going to wrap up our marathon section on selectors and we're going to look at the first selectors in CSS and the first one we're going to look at is the first letter selector and you guessed it it selects the first letter in an element now you'll notice that this particular pseudo selector needs a double colon and basically that is to differentiate this type of pseudo selector from other pseudo classes we're not going to get into the very lengthy reason why it's not really necessary just remember when you want to use the first letter selector you need a double colon now we're going to go ahead and target our paragraph elements of our paragraph elements so we're going to go ahead and increase the size and you'll see that sometimes in paragraphs where they'll increase the size of the first letter and make it bold so let's just go ahead and do that here so let's go ahead and set the font weight to bolt and then let's increase the font size and we'll set this to 24 pixels that looks pretty good okay so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see the first letter and all of our paragraphs are now bold and they are a larger font size now one of the more recent selectors is the first-line selector and that is very handy if you want to do some responsive CSS development and you guessed it it allows you to select the first line in a particular element this might be useful if you have a bunch of banners and you want to highlight the first line or if you have an advertisement and you want to bring attention to the very first line to grab people's attention it can be very useful for things like that so let's go ahead and we'll just copy and paste this rule set here so we don't have to type everything over again now the big difference is for this pseudo selector we actually only use one colon so that's all we use and let's go ahead and set this to first line and let's go ahead and change the color to red so we want to bring some attention to the first line in each one of our paragraphs and again you could select any element with text that you want we could select our h2 elements or h1 elements whatever we want so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see every single line now is selected so that looks pretty good okay I will see you guys in the next video thank you
