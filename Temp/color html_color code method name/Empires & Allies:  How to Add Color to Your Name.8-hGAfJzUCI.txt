hey guys this is smokey cat but we're going to talk about today is changing your name and possibly adding colors to it so when you create your base it will be asking you to make your name and so when you do I'm going to erase what I have here and sometimes you might have a generic name that starts a general number and that is several numbers it's really recommended that you change your name make and change it to something that really is meaningful to you something that other players can know that who you are so how do you change your name well you click on this icon the gear icon I call it and then you click on the help tab and then you click on the change name button and there you can change your name but I've got a bunch of color codes in front of mine and that this is what they look like and they're a combination of 0 to 9 or 8 a through F I use a color picker on my iOS phone but they also have one for Android and we're going to go to sort of look through that and see what kind of colors I'm going to focus in on these six digits here so if I bring all the red green and blue colors down to zero that's what the hex code you would put in brackets and if you were going to make it all red it would be FF and then four zeros or all green and you can see the numbers are going all the way up to total FF there and that X green and then blue these two digits all the way up to 255 or the total FF is blue and then you can have different combinations of those so let's put them all at the center not next grey and if you prove it pulling these down and these around make different colors so you can use the apps like this to sort of choose a color that you that you like and then you can put it in in front your name and basically you have to do it like with these kind of brackets so - smokey cat and I have these different numbers now on this name I have them sort of a different color so I'm going to try it now with a different set of six digits in front of my name and the rest me want to change it and I say yes so now I can't change my name anymore because I've changed it to that and I don't really like it it's a dark color so if you messed up this time here's what you can do go to the gear icon click on help and click on player support and then scroll down and you'll see a account and settings click on account settings how do I change my name and I'll show you how to change it normally the first time like we just showed you but if you change can't wants to change it again it would lead you to a Google Doc where you can choose basically tell them that you want to get your change name button again and so basically meters your Z ID which is underneath the help tab write that down somewhere where and type it in and you will also need what your name is now and so I'm going to write down the brackets with my color code inside there was 0 9 9 and end bracket and then my name is smokey Kat 103 I think what you also need is your alliance name some take good track of that and then just tell them that you want to change your name and they're pretty good about it I would recommend this and not to change it any more because they don't really I think this is the third time you change your name so it's not a good idea to change it anymore and now you wait about 24 to 48 hours and you go back into that account and it will have possibly changed and so we're going to go back into the account into my Sophie cat and I'm going to go under the gear icon and go into the help tab and look change your name is there now I'm going to change it back to what I won't really want it to do so I'm going to use my arrow keys and I'm going to add a little code here this what this code does is it takes away the previous color code it will - in between the two brackets yes there are more codes that you can use and these are them so you can use bold and remove bold italic and remove the italic superscript and subscript and the - in the brackets and the double - the brackets remove the last two colors one thing to remember though is that these codes with the forward slash in front of them you not to use them for names why because if you use them you can lock up your name account I had an account Ranger Rick that was locked up for several weeks and thanks to the Linga I got it back so I've got this name I've got my little - in there to remove the color but I want to change the color a little bit so we're going to change it to six six nine nine it's going to be make it kind of a blue color and go ahead and accept this change I like the way it looks and there we go change that out smoky cat looks great so let's practice using the color codes I usually do is I like to take my account and go to and make a create a new account so let's put up make a new alliance name this one we can use this yellow crazy with a kind of purple alliance and remove those two colors for the last this one makes it yellow this one makes it purple and these codes remove the both colors for you and let's go make a description because they won't allow you make an alliance without a last description and create whoops it's kind of looks funny because it's mixed for the color cyan which is kind of a Bluegreen sometimes the best to do it in chat and the bold code the B and kind of - so you can actually type up color combinations in the announcements once you're in general in a new alliance and you can play around with colors there that basically will give you the most accurate color combos sometimes if you use the same code say in chat for example if I copy this to chat you can sort of see the difference because the chat colors are all mixed with the light blue color which is a little bit different from the Alliance color but you can see the difference these are some of my friends and they have really long names with lots of different colors Zynga stopped us a while ago but they allowed them to keep their names because they're called grandfather day and they were able to be up to 160 characters long now they are limited to 20 characters or names Alliance names can be up to 100 so these are my accounts there's my Ranger Rick account it's about a hundred and two characters long and my ghost cat which is about 88 character have a great day and don't forget to Like and subscribe see ya
