[Music] hi guys welcome to neurotechnologies this is the brush in this video session i will try to show you from attributes those are called advanced reforms related to html5 these form attributes are mainly too many attributes are there in html5 form related attributes - one is autocomplete another one is the no validate what is autocomplete what is no validate generally autocomplete is working based on browser history if browser having history autocomplete always on a browser does enter history autocomplete 'off for example with autocomplete working principle how simply existed we can write of the definition autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete on or off on off means the boolean values by default autocomplete on number of when autocomplete is on the browser automatically complete values based on values that user has entered before please try to understand that point very clearly for example Gmail you opened you entered maybe different different melodies maybe one time two times at least one time you enter it is automatically storing in the history second time or third time or fourth time the again eg melody and open and entering same melody whenever first letter you entered remaining automatically shows you this is called autocomplete feature it is completely working based on history now it is a boolean value autocomplete on or off now before I am entering into autocomplete normal form without autocomplete operation just I designed for you in my previous session same form available and showing that but I didn't use any autocomplete here this the action explained already the small label label and input type email text box as well as submit button now I am going to application that means of a browser sorry now I displayed first name email like that just for example I'm entering first character are automatically displaying the values before already are be entered raju capitulated and small letter Raj for example and selected that and for example again I am selecting and entering letter K all ready to mail it is entered with that one I'm selecting any one yes so by default autocomplete on I didn't write observe clearly so I made the note point already clearly by default autocomplete is on now I am writing autocomplete is equal to off whenever autocomplete 'off now these values unable to display come to browser just refresh that enter are nothing comes again enter K I think um so try on annual system practically if you install first time your browser this feature old work already you are working on that history is there definitely this feature shows you very clearly but this feature completely related to browser history once removed historian ticket one this is a sari available that one that time also you can try to check it autocomplete feature now autocomplete is shown to you form level now I am coming to input level because by definition very clear here once again my definition autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or input a field for example on your form for controls are there first name middle name last name email for example I need email level autocomplete on remaining 3 I want off so remaining 3 purposes clearing formula autocomplete 'off only email ever on purpose that particular input level I am giving autocomplete on practically we can observe now autocomplete 'off which level form level of the existence now I am coming to same autocomplete and taking I am coming to email level autocomplete all I wrote so right now only one control available are two controls or three controls that you can practice now this is applicable to all form controls even this one also but this office who are writing with on so email only on remaining all are off now first letter are in red because autocomplete 'off and come to email enter kate yes so this is input level on this is total form level off I provided for example if you are giving another control yes I am giving last name for your better understanding so first name last name I am taking last name now I provided L name here now refresh just now first name not working last name also not working but email working means that off is applicable to all controls except email ID so this is auto complete form level autocomplete input level we can see another attribute in advanced forms no validate in real-time applications where we are working with the projects for example registered user just to use them in many web applications we are saying that guest user does not require any input user name password nothing required but a registered user always need to enter user name and the related password then only registered user can able to login for example on a guest user without the username password I can browse how that is means required we are making no validate we'll observe that no validate before no validate will try to definition first no validate attribute is a boolean attribute when present it specifies that the form data should not be validated when submitted should not be validated when submitted now we can try that no validate is equal to no validate means on nowhere it is good off so any one we can use so that time no validate purpose autocomplete 'off I am removing now I don't want any autocomplete our previous attribute already discussed with you right now I am showing here first required required already explained in previous video session which is giving mandatory input compulsory required and email ID level required yes entered now once you are refreshing just click without entering because input a mandatory mess is coming if you are not entering it never goes to next page or next form now I am coming back that I am giving no valid date is equal to no validate which level formula balem providing not input level so once you say no validate is equal to' validate required attribute is in off stage means it is not validating the form now once you are coming back to your applicant miss of a browser refresh that once you refresh click on login immediately it is going to the next space observe so input doesn't required so what is the use of no validate in some situations we are allowing non registered users also to browser application that time we are using that anyway no validate also useful in the ban wine meant or above whenever all users to enjoy our web application now these two attributes applied for form level one attribute only that is no validate and autocomplete is shown to you input level as well as form level so in html5 number of input attributes available thank you for watching video and for more videos please subscribe youtube.com / variety [Music]
