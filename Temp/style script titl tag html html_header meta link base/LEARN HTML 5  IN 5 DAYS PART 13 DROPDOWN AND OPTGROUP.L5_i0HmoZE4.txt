hi friends welcome to the channel of learning by doing today we are going to learn some more types of history will fight and today I'm going to tell you about the drop-down list tag and here is my notepad and in the title i'm going to write as drop-down list ok let me tell you about drop-down list that is nothing but if you are select an option in the button or anything that the brown will appear what you want to select just we'll see how it's going to look by just coding we learn by doing something on our code so here we have one option like a select select tag view in the Select tag the Select tag is going to be in with / select because in the drop-down we need to select one option right so in that in that sense they given one of the tack all the Select tag and in that we are having with the different kinds of options in the drop down time to need to select so that's going to be displayed in the option time that was you any user friendly language which makes you to look Wow because whatever we want we are going to talk that's going to be right in our pages right and that's called the code it is very easy to listen and hit is very easy to learn to this is nothing but one of the option in my drop-down track that is i am going to be select and i'll just copy it no need of writing it again and again i am just copying it and I am just pasting it Oh God okay I'm just pasting it okay and here you are going to see the five options for your selection I'm in like two three four and if you and here we have only one thing that we can select to I mean right term in the drop-down if we we are given only select option for the drop-down we can select only one option in it I mean like I have five five different kinds of foods and I can eat only one in that we cannot equal to 23 foot at a time because there is nothing but other drop down a box of but using this select option and in the select option we are having than another attribute within it is called the multiple attribute in that we can select one not two or three four how many you want you can select in that and we're going to see that multiple select option here itself I hope for you are going to be see that multiple drop-down list item here also just copied ctrl c and i am going to paste this code again here and in the select option i am going to put only one thing select tag i am going to put only one thing that I want my selection to be as multiple then I am going to save this and how we going to look well see in our web browser in the web browser I'm going to refresh it see you guys we are having good for its for the first and we will use some break here or then it may look some little bit better for you I'm going to save it see you guys here I can select only one two three four five I am selecting for and here we can select how many we want one two three I mean like it was it was the drop down we can select how much you want you can select in this this is nothing but the selection options here we can select only one and here we cancel is one two three how many we want we can selected this this is nothing but the selection option and the drop-down list in it and we are going to talk about one more tag it is called a optional group tag I mean like if we are have we are well known that in the colleges or in the political parties or anything we are going to see that groups right hey this is my group this is my group co CC like that I'm just rapping about the group like if we can have any select our group in that manner in this this is one of the one of the option with their in the history milf I language called the optional group selecting my option in the group in a group we can so we can put some of the options any group I like we are having one group and we can in that group we are putting some more options in it this is nothing but the opt group the tag was nothing but nopt group this has to be in the selection of select targets on because we are going to be select from that right so whatever we are going to be select seeing something we are going to put that in the selector tag itself in bit opta group i am going to give in optical rupees are one of the attribute called the label in that label i am going to put as the group 1 this is my group 1 we are having one two three four five groups in mohali so it is my first group in that first group and giving the option as first group is going to study mathematics okay guys first group is going to study the mathematics this most my option for them and this group was going to be and this opt group is going to be end as / oft group as usual if I want to represent the another group right if I want to represent group to like ml of the group under the group if we can write within the selection option itself this is group too I am going to make them to steady what we are going to make them to study ok I am asking you i am going to make them to study HTML and then we are giving another option for them also as what will give for them another option we are going to study the CSS also i am giving two options to them this group has to study to that is the history ml and CSS and i am going to give another group also like that you can give but how many number of groups you want you can give to that i am going to paste it here and i am going to put it as a label three this is methyl group the methyl group is also going to be study this whatever the option you want i'm here this giving the languages that they need to study but this is nothing of God nothing about the optional group which was one of the tag that was introduced in the html5 I am going to save it and I'm going to see this in our webpage see you guys in my in mind um see let's go to her rump this is was the selection a select group and that we are having the options as 1 2 3 4 5 this is not a multiple select this is only a single option select so we are having the options like 1 2 3 4 5 in that the select group we are having another opt group after group as one of the time within this this going to be group some of the elements I mean like some of some kinds of elements to be in one group and as the kind of elements to be in another group like that we are having the option this is nothing but the opt group 1 means we are having all these selections and see in the group 1 you can select the mathematics and you can select HTML this will be selected in the form of further groups I mean after this group this group and all this okay guys got it and I am going to tell you another kind of tag that is nothing but the datalist attack in the data list tag them it is similar to the earth to just like the select option and all this but we are having a different kind like in the text box if we click on the text box been going to see the sum of the number of names that coming down off it i mean like whenever you select on the text up they are going to put on some of the web pages like aerospace or engineering or anything all you all you are saying details and all this it will come like drop down this is this will be displayed in the attack called the data list tag the detail is tag is going to be displayed in that manner and I'm going to tell you about that i'll give the label I mean like this is the heading for that data list as choose the name or anything whatever you night choose the name and in that I'm going to give the one of the name list a name list is going to be happen in it and also and the input button i am going to give the list as well as the attribute which is in that we have many attributes in the input so i am going to introduce one on one when i got the chance to tell you guys not all the attributes at a time because we will get confused of it if i tell you all the attributes at a time so i am introducing if possible law will talk about all the attributes one day but i am introducing you and you so you can check it out whenever you are seeing this video's and now i am going to tell you about the data list that was the new tag that were going to be introduced ID as the name list also in the nameless has to be in between the characters in quotation marks so in this I'm having the options right option was as usual for everything so it is very good to me if I copy this because I don't have that much strength to write the code again and again so I am going to select the this one this code because I have the option tag in this so control seen here i'm going to paste the tag i mean i'm going to paste the code with that is option option and there is no need of an option closing and all this even if he does not give in the clothes and all this also it will display guys even if you given something in the value also it will display there is no issue a dent I forget to say to you about that there is no I sure AM CAC I am deleting all this Here I am deleting all these options of closing even if he does not close the option tag also there is no problem I am giving the value I put the nameless right so I am giving it as bandwidth so as the first name and the second name as up Keith t and the third name as a stage and the fourth name as rom and first name as sir whatever and i'm going to give one more option here because some mayfield because i have given all the names which are fun to relay so I am giving one more name as chai too so this would all mind the name list which I want to display when i click on the text area if you guys does the data list was started and the data list of was to be gets in by using / data list as usual so I am giving this last data list as another closed of close tag of the data list as usual so end of this do you have anything okay nothing see how it's going to be looking up I am going to save it and we'll put some break here because it may look different and I'm going to save it again and I'm going to see how it's going to look hope my code will work out I mean like my code will get a chance okay see you guys choose the name i have put this in the label tag because i want to see this on under this on the web page so i put it in the label tag and in that i have written the data list data list attack we have written the options like all the name is so i am going to be click here there is nothing if i put k see he is coming if i put em man with and rom is coming the it is going to be checked the the similarities i mean the similar items mmm it's going to be sorting just like it is going to be sorted and if you click the drop-down button here this is nothing but
