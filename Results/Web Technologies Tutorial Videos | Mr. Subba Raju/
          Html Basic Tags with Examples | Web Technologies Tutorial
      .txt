hi guys welcome to nourish technologies this is a Brazil we will see in this video session paragraph tag headings in HTML font attack horizontal rule and mark you related actions and mark you tag first will observe paragraph tag it is used to divide text into multiple paragraphs it is a paid tag it has a different attributes aligned and it has different parameters left right center justified only element specific related attribute only one available aligned if you need global attributes we can add action attributes means even related attributes we can add now practically we can observe P tag and there is a paragraph I kept same paragraph I am taking another one so two paragraphs I am going to be just I am refreshing on my webpage once if you are refreshing on my webpage by default it is displaying only a single paragraph actually in my notepad two paragraphs available now whenever you need to do that we can use paragraph and paragraph close again paragraph and paragraph close once two paragraphs available just a refresh now two paragraphs it is showing clearly then sometimes you people getting doubt why paragraph you are using serve bread tag is better known so break tag also breaking two paragraphs yes better but break purpose is breaking lines paragraph purpose is to make paragraphs paragraph inside also we can use break tag so break tag is only for breaking lines if output is coming correctly but whatever the tax we are writing those are a meaningful or not we need to check it first because your SEO is the most important whenever we are implementing pack it should reflect the concept so to divide the paragraphs never use brake tech to divide the lines you can use break tag to divide the paragraphs paragraph is better now two paragraphs available here I want to apply attributes P tagged with the attributes I'm adding with attributes so P tag available completely means alignment perfect you are unable to see narration technologies number one leading Training Institute up to there I am removing just Comfort purpose right and I made here these lines I am duplicating for more visibility purpose to show you clearly just I am writing one attribute a line of course by default left the alignment align I am providing Center double quotation single quotation no quotation all are affected double quotation real-time industry and I am giving right side okay now I am not giving the third one let me show first up two three and three lines left center right now they say technologies is number one they say technology is number one that is a technologies number now the third one up - okay but fourth one is their justified that I need to show you right the fourth one is this one left side whatever the margin available right side margin is not equal observe correctly if you require left and right side both sides equal margin we are writing a line justify just refresh that left side whatever the margin available right side also same margin available this is we are calling as justification and perfectly it is showing the margin that purpose we are using justify so paragraph tag divide the text into multiple paragraphs because by default of Apple supports only single paragraph it has only one attribute that is aligned four parameters left center right justify by default left next tag we can see that is font tag what is font attack generally for D tag is used to format the text such as changing that exercise color styles different different kind of colors and styles we can apply it is a paid tag and attributes also available color size font face this related example we can observe I am giving font to tag the width attributes and whatever available here I am removing completely already paragraph available that when I am replacing with font fo n type front and font ever save it and run of the web browser perfect visibility aligned I removed there is a reason right side as usual came right now this 140 tag level first attribute is color I am applying color is equal to color codes already explained to you 0 0 0 0 FF and close now I am refreshing observer so it is affecting color my ratio technologies total text is converted into blue color now come back to and this is a size also available here si JD size is equal to I am giving 6 pixels only 6 mm provided now how it is reflecting we can see that is a 6 so bigger font it is showing and next one is face means what kind of font you are going to be face is equal to I am you year Tahoma any face we can apply and kummel I am using in my projects Tahoma and it is applied Tahoma so now you want to apply any new font related go to format just click on font and copy whatever the format you required copy that and cancel it and paste there and refresh just paste it and save it refresh any kind of for example you need to see another one right format font whichever the font you are liking take the font for example this font you want copy it and paste there and any font you can take right save it by default Times New Roman for example some XYZ font you applied the font is not applied on the page by d4 it converted into Times New Roman this is a font attack so font attack is nothing but to apply different the colors sizes and family means faces it is a paid tag and it supports mainly three attributes whether it one color size and font face I am going to next HTML headings what are the headings available general an HTML 6 headings available these 6 headings or 6 styles available highest and a bigger heading is h1 at least one is h6 and I will try to show you all our paid attacks here example we can observe now I am going to headings and headings headings tax headings tagged with attributes attributable here that is align attribute and now I am showing only narezo technologies of number one and I am removing now I am adding here h1 and I said H 1 and H 1 close heading 1 close like that I require remaining also 2 3 4 5 and 6 now I want to convert this one by one two and three four five six headings and this 1 2 3 & 4 5 6 so these are the headings now I am going to run without any attributes then apply apply out attributes after execution so this is so how much size you have available you can see the bigger size is h1 and a least size is h6 narration technologies is number one always heading stag with attributes I said then I am using align is equal to I am using left side of course by default now I am using a line is equal to center yes a line is equal to right side now remaining three I am removing save that information so degrees for a perfect affection of course you can apply for h4 h5 six also I am showing first three attacks any number of tags you can apply like that so this is aligned attribute with headings headings are very important in every page as per receiver rule minimum heading must be their minimum one heading must be there so I will go to next tag that is a horizontal rule HR tag we are calling what is horizontal rule duty it is giving horizontally a line across the webpage and if you are going to see horizontal rules we can one by one I will show you horizontal rule related also across the webpage it is a non-paid attack and syntax available non-paid tag attributes available different different attributes horizontal level attributes parameters color a name color code size in pixels width in pixels or percentage align left right center no shade no shade available and even I implemented a few node points also the default width of the horizontal rule is hundred percent the default alignment of the HR is Center no shade attribute will be applied only when we are not specifying the color of the horizontal rule these are the three main node points you need to remember now HR tag I am going to work come back to my source code HR tag with attributes once that when available write to remove this and a chart I will apply completely all headings I am removing because in the previous example related one and remove it yes save it HR tag you can apply HR control C control right and before line also enough first three horizontal rules practically weakens so HR HR HR three one applied three visible to you now top I don't want bottom means bottom are even other one also you can take no issue right because I want to use in a more meaningful way that right erasure technologies is number one available here and there I want to apply different different types different attributes what is the first attribute color is equal to code I am using zero zero yes refresh that color code again color name only you can use color is equal to color name I am implementing blue yes refresh next one color name already use color code I use I am using color is equal to again color code hash FF 0 0 FF right refresh different colors so this is oriental rule by default 100% width available now the next one is what is the next attribute that is a size available now we'll apply the size and I am providing size is equal to I am giving 2 pixels with the sizes right if i refresh that on my web browser by default 2 pixel only now I am taking the size and I am copying to next one I am providing 4 pixels yes I am next I am taking I am providing 6 pixels right 6 pixels refresh it to affected 6 also perfectly affected now come back to again the next attribute sighs after available width aligned so width we can see first so width is equal to I am giving 50 pixels then I am writing width is equal to and I am providing 100 pixels width is equal to one five zero pixels and I am writing perfectly by default a center already note points are shown to you so Center available I want to align this one this one I want to show left this one I want to show right side definitely now first I am applying on first horizontal rule align is equal to left side and by default Center available align is equal to right side save it and run it perfectly aligned so by default is Center available finally last attribute we can see no shade what is this no shared speciality for example I'm increasing this one to 256 cells because no shade correctly I want to show you and I want to increase width also little bit more and 10 pixels I am showing so that you people can understand clearly that is available if I am applying no shade here what happens we can see no shade is equal to no shade whenever we are providing that it is unable to affect on that one already made note point when color attribute available no shade unable to apply remove the color attribute and check the no right remove control X save it and refresh it no if no shade also removed what happened right that one also another scenario no right and thing it is looking like something gap line or some differently it is not good so that time to avoid a gap we are adding actually no this is the perfect example so finally HR tag is used to design horizontal lines across the page it is having multiple attributes every attribute practically we worked one is the color second one is size third one is width fourth one is aligned fifth one is no shade color name color could anyone we can use and the note points whatever I implemented default width of the horizontal rule is under person the default alignment of the HR is Center no shade attribute will be applied when we are not specifying the color of the horizontal rule it is HR attack so simple and easy to understand that is all these in a simple way thank you for watching my videos for more videos catch me on youtube.com slash nourish IT
