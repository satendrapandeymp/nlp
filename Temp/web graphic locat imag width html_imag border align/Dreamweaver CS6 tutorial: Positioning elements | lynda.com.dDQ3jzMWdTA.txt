currently you can see how my webpage is set up I do have some basic formatting all of my text is in here and I have a nice background but still it's a far cry from my actual design that I created in Photoshop so let's go ahead and take a look at that Here I am in Photoshop and you can see that I need to insert a logo and I need to start creating some items in here so I need to basically create a box to position in my navigation I need this header text to be right there and I need to create a content box right here where all my content will exist so I need to start creating those various divisions for my webpage so I'm going to do that by going back into Dreamweaver and right in here in Dreamweaver I'm gonna place my cursor at the top and I'm going to insert an image the image I'm going to insert happens to be in my chapter Oh to my o for begin folder keep in mind this is where my index.html file exists so relative to that if I go in that images folder that's where I have my ping file so I want to make sure the link to my graphic that URL is relative okay so that's what that should look like selecting open I want to add some alternate text Eva Jones design search engines will pick up on this so that's why I want to add that alternate text there it is now I'm going to start positioning some of these items and again I want to start dividing up this content so I'm going to use some divs luckily if I go to my insert panel and I change to layout I have these different layout options and really what I want to do is start to absolute position some divisions some divs so this gives me the ability to draw an AP div so selecting that I can just click and drag to make a box for my logo with that drawn I can select my logo cut it place my cursor inside of that AP div and then paste it just like that now if I select that yellow border you can see that down here in my properties panel I can start to adjust this accordingly in fact I want it to be about a hundred pixels from the left side and the top looks perfect because I want it to be right up at that top edge just like that looks pretty good the z-index I'll get into later but that's the depth that it's at and usually anytime I start creating these divs I just start getting the habit of just saving my file so that's what I'm doing save my file my next objective here is going to be to create navigation bar so I'm just going to place my cursor up here and just hit return a couple times to give me a little bit of space but I want to draw an AP div for the navigation so selecting that drawing my bar just like that you can see I've drawn this AP div just like that in fact right down here remember it was black in my Photoshop design I can change the background to black just like that so I've created that again I'm just going to get the habit of saving I've saved this specific CSS element but now what I want to do is inside of here if I click in here I can start typing in some text so I need to have home about portfolio and contact as those various links so I'm just typing in some text now I want this text to be flush right so what I can do is I can go to my properties panel CSS tabs selected and just make sure your page is saved so I'm going to save this page and right over here I can go ahead and align right selecting that it will align it the right-hand side so far so good I'm going to insert a couple more draw AP div for this header right here just beneath the logo I can draw that just like that taking that line selecting it cutting it placing my cursor in there pasting it in there just like that you'll notice this did change because it didn't actually take the heading one style and this will happen if that does just select it and just like you did before for HTML tab you need to make sure you change that to heading 1 and there's your particular style alright that looks good I can even shorten this up a little bit if I want to next up is all of this text right here as I scroll down well same thing drawing an AP div about halfway right here I'll draw that AP div just like that I'll change the background color to black and now I can take this text selecting it all and then cutting it and then placing my cursor in here and pasting it you can see all of that text I'll scroll up but look at my box look that black only goes so far down well if I select that AP div you can see right in here oh look the height 236 pixels well that's not going to work I can select that delete it hit Enter or return and you can see it fills it up all the way down alright so far so good I think that's working out pretty well in fact I'm going to select live view just to experience this a little bit more closely to what the end user will see and you can tell look what I have going on this logo is actually behind this bar when really I need to change the depth of these items so that's what I'm going to do next I'm going to turn off live view I'm going to select this AP div the first one that I drew the Z index is at one so it's like closest to the background well I just need to make it higher than this nav which happens to be at two so if I select this one I can select it you know what let's type in 200 okay because you can go much higher than say single digits and now that's always going to be on top even when I start to draw more in there just like I plan on doing so selecting live view you can see all of my content is positioned appropriately and I can move on to the next step and the next step will be actually customizing the look of this even more a
