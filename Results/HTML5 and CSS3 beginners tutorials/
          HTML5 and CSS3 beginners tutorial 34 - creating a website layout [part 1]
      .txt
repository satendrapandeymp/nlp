hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and in this tutorial which is tutorial number 34 we are finally going to start creating a basic website template or website layout that we are going to use or that you guys will be able to use to create all your websites from now on okay so I've got some code from the previous tutorial over here and these are basically just the new tags which I did speak about in the previous tutorial so if you guys didn't watch that just go back and watch that and all of this is going to make sense but we've got our header tag navigation tag section tag and let's actually space this out a little bit better and underneath that we've got the aside tag and right at the bottom the new footer tag okay so these are all tags that we're going to be able to use to divide our website up into like just manageable or logical sections okay now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this navigation tag out over here and I'm going to place it inside my header because it's a good idea like to include your navigation in your header and that way you can just have your header on every single page and it'll be the same because your navigations probably also going to have to be the same across all pages so I like to have my navigation inside of my header some people actually do that some people like to have the navigation inside of the side tag and then place the navigation on the side but I'm like I favor having my navigation in the head and actually going across the top of the webpage kind of like Google or Facebook or something so let's talk about what we actually need to put in our head at now because we already know we're going to have to put our nav navigation in here but other than that we're also going to have to place our logo so I'm going to create an image tag over here and I'm going to give this a source of logo dot ping but I haven't actually created a logo yet I don't have one so this isn't going to show up until I actually create the image but for now let's just give this an alt attribute of logo area and that means that for now as a placeholder we'll have these words logo area appearing where our logo is supposed to go at least you know until I create an actual logo okay in the navigation we're going to have to place a whole bunch of links to other pages but we don't have any other pages yet so the links aren't going to be complete and the way I like to do this is create an unordered list because it just makes things a little bit more manageable and there we go we have an unordered list so inside the unordered list we're going to have a bunch of list items okay and in these list items we're actually going to have our links so a and ending a ok and let's just give this an H ref tag of nothing okay now because we haven't created these webpages yet we don't want these links to actually go anywhere because they'll go to a page that doesn't exist so we'll leave the H ref blank and that means the link will still show up so we can still style the web page and get the link looking all pretty but it doesn't have to work until we actually you know I have actually created the other pages so the first page we can link to is home which is pretty much going to be the page that we on already because your index page is your home page then let's copy this and paste it down here a few times so the next page that we can link to or you know have a fake link to is the about page because pretty much every website has an about page other than that lets do a tutorials page just because I make tutorials so you know that's all I'm thinking about right now and at the last link we can place in a contact page okay so these pages don't exist right now so we're leaving the HRF blank but the links will still show up so if I run this in Firefox let's go over here run in Firefox we have the logo area which we're going to put our logo in there soon enough as soon as I make one I haven't made one yet but we have our navigation showing up here as well but it's got these bullet points so don't worry about that we are going to style that all this these bullet points away later on with the styling but for now you know only our navigation at least shows up so that's what we wanted to look out for so that is pretty much our header done we can add some stuff later maybe but you know for now I think we've got our you know basic content in there so for our section I think I'm going to leave this for the next tutorial so let's just make a comment over here and comment so actually so like weird in HTML to remember that smaller than greater than sign of the exclamation mark and stuff but okay next tutorial so I'm gonna get back to this but in the next video okay so yeah like I said we'll do this in the next tutorial I kind of lost my place because I had to go to all my dog to stop barking okay then in the aside section like I said this would just be sort of some side news or just content that isn't that important but I think we'll get to this in the next video as well because this video is getting kind of long so I'm just going to copy that and paste that here and we'll definitely work on those in the next video but for the footer this you know sometimes websites don't really have anything that they want to put in their footer so like if your website is going to be a little bit empty but you still need a foot this is pretty much where your copyright will go okay so if you guys want a little you know symbol I think it's alt ctrl C okay now can't get that to appear but if I type in the word and copy so and percent and a copy just like this I will get a little copyright symbol that shows up and then I can just put in your copyright oops copyright the programmers Creed calm and actually let's make that all one word and maybe get rid of the so copyright program is creat dot-com and if I save that now go over to Firefox and click refresh you can see I've got my copyright showing up at the bottom and this is the little copyright symbol I was talking about and the way you make that in HTML is by writing and copy with a little semicolon okay so that's all for this video but come back in the next video where we will start putting some more information in our section and our aside section and until then I will see you guys next time
