hi this is tomas michaud welcome back to foundations of web design in this video we're gonna look at quotations there's two different types of quotations that we can have within a website we could quote somebody at length or we could quote somebody in a paragraph so let's take a look and see how this works down in the description there is a file for you to download if you haven't already downloaded it in some of the earlier videos when you uncompress this folder 0 to - text chapter 2 - text inside of here you'll find the quotes dot HTML and that you will want to open up into your text editor so I'm gonna open that up into my Komodo edit ok so we have our basic HTML document here we've already got the global elements supplied so let's take a look and see how we utilize the blockquote first off we have a block quote block level element remember once we close an element for a block quote it gives us a new line and so the block quote is written out like so block quotes all one word and that's gonna take contain the quote by the individual as well as who sent it and we'll add some more information in here in just a moment and we want to go ahead and close that block quote now we could just have the quote by itself and be done with it we could end up adding in a paragraph since this is some text that somebody said so it's a sentence that we have and we surround it by a paragraph we can do this as well there are other elements that you could place within the block quote but we're just wanting to keep this a little you know not too not too crazy with all the markup and stuff like that at this point so we have the opening block quote element we have a paragraph of text that Helen Keller had said optimism is the faith that leads to achievement nothing can be done without hope confidence so once we have the blockquote and if we want to cite where we took this from or where we got this quote from where I got it over was over brainy quote calm there's a couple of ways that we can cite this quote there is the cite attribute that we can place within the opening tech attributes are placed within the opening tag of an element and we could end up in the comments here we really don't need this stuff right after the period here so you can delete that and just copy the HTTP colon and all the way out to the five seven nine so I'm gonna copy that and I'm gonna place that in and so it's pasting in the the website address the URL address into the site attribute all right now nothing will show up on a web site for this we could exploit it through the use of I don't know possibly CSS and also JavaScript but and I think Firefox right now is the only browser that kind of takes advantage of the site attribute so while that's good it's actually even better if we can use the the site element within the the block quote now it's kind of crazy is that even though Helen Keller is attributed to the quote what we're actually wanting the site is where we took the quote from it could be from a book it could be from a web site and we can say Helen Keller via brainy quote I'll put that all this one word I can't remove their web site is all one word or if it's two separate words either way it'll work so what's going to happen is is that we're gonna use the anchor tag element we haven't really talked about the anchor tag but this allows us to link to a web site so the anchor tag with the h r EF attribute and we're gonna put in an equals and then we're gonna put an other equals sign and then we're gonna close that anchor tag that opening anchor tag and then we'll put in a closing anchor tag on the other side and what we want to do is if we already still have this in our clipboard memory we can copy this again if we don't and place that within the anchor tag so what we want to do is we are going to place the site element before the anchor tag and we're gonna close that site element let's see if I can actually hit the right letters on the keyboard like characters there we go so we're actually stating that Helen Keller said said this and our citation is from where we got the quote from all right so let's take a look we're gonna save this and we're gonna open this up into a browser this time I'm gonna open this up into Firefox click on preview and so here is the quote optimism and Helen Keller is the person who said it via brainy quote so one of the things that I want you to notice with a block quote it's very similar to our lists that are unordered or ordered or of the description in the description lists is that once again it is indented here and so as some margin over here onto the left hand side or some padding over to the left hand side well once we get into CSS we'll talk about how we can utilize either margin or padding to creating this space and what the browser uses in order to do the indention because when it indents the block quote and when it indents the list items it uses one type of property for those and for the block quote it uses another type of property which is rather interesting anyway you don't have to worry about that right now what this is just doing is its indenting that block quote and we have the opening block quote element and the closing block quote and so everything gets pushed away from the left-hand side of the browser here alright so with some CSS we could style this to be even more useful to us visually but anyway that kind of at least shows us the basic usage of the blockquote element so that is in a block level blockquote element but what we wanted to also look at is the use of quoting somebody as it's within a paragraph so when starting a project it's good to remember what Benjamin Franklin once said by failing to prepare our you're preparing to fail so this is a quote that by Benjamin Franklin all right so let's go back to the text editor and in the inline quote we at this is we're gonna make this into a paragraph here so we'll put in our opening paragraph tag and at the very end after the period we're going to put in the closing paragraph the inline quote element is just simply the cue element and that is going to be right before the word by so that's where the quote starts and the quote ends here at preparing to fail and you know if the quote is at the end of a sentence we're gonna place that cue element we're gonna close that cue element after the period okay so it's part of our paragraph there and so what we want to do is if we are citing Benjamin Franklin we're not actually citing Benjamin Franklin where we're citing maybe from where we read it so it would actually have to the citation would once again have to come from brainy quote so the specification is that normally we don't cite the the person we cite the the place that we took it from okay so in this particular instance we don't necessarily have to place a site elements because maybe we don't want to place brainy quote within our text and we could just simply have the site attribute within the cue element and placing the URL address of where that whatever that is over at brainy quote so it's a different place than Helen Keller was so we could end up putting that URL address in there if we wanted to cite brainy quote we'd have the place just like what we did here and place the site element in and maybe somewhere after brink been Benjamin Franklin mainly I just want to keep this very simple and looking at the inline quote element what does it do so let's go ahead and save this and once again I'm gonna go back over to Firefox and all we're gonna do is refresh the browser and the little URL bar up in here we can hit refresh and you'll notice what the browser does for Firefox it actually puts in quotes and I can't actually select the quotes it actually puts it in there dynamically so it actually puts smart quotes in there and it places it around the quote of what we just placed it in okay so it's pretty neat what the inline quote can do for us we can do even more than that with CSS and some browsers don't actually place in the quotations via CSS we could actually place in quotes if we wanted to there's a resource that I'm gonna provide to you that really kind of goes through it the quotes the citations quite extensively over at the html5 dr. and quoting and citing with a blockquote cue site element and the site attribute so this was written back in June 28 2011 and has some updates to it but it's a very you know fairly lengthy article and it's something that it would be really good to read through so you know how to properly use the block quote as well as the cue element and the cite element alright that does it for the block quote and quoting sources and if you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me or visit the web
