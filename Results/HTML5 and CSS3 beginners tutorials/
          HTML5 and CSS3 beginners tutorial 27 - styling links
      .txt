hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 27 and in this tutorial I am going to show you guys how to style links on your web page using CSS okay so I decided that this would be a good time to throw this tutorial in because we were talking about pseudo classes and whenever you going to style links on your web page you're actually going to make use of pseudo classes to style them so let's go ahead and actually just throw a link in on our page so I'm going to go ahead and just add my two a tags and I'm going to make a link to my youtube channel so we'll just type in my channel over here and for the href obviously I have to put the URL of my youtube channel which is HTTP colon slash slash W youtube.com slash Quinton what and I'd really like to change it to slash programs Creed but I cannot because I already set it to this URL before which is a shame but anyways if I go ahead now and save this and run this in Firefox now you'll see that I get a link on my web page okay so nothing interesting about this just yet but like I said whenever we style links on our web page we make use of four different classes so let me go ahead and show you what those classes are and the first one is just a normal link that's never been visited or never been clicked on so that would just be a by itself then the second state that we can style our link in and this is where we make use of pseudo classes now so we're going to have to put that colon in there and the second class is hover so this is basically while your mouse is hovering over the link then the second one we is going to be a active and this is basically the state that the link is in while you are clicking down on the actual link and then the last one is a visited and this is basically the state at which the link has already been visited so you've already been to the URL that that link will take you to okay so without changing anything let's go back to the browser over here and let me explain okay so right now our link is completely default and it's never been visited so right now we are looking at our link in this state's just the normal state okay but if I go ahead and hover over this link nothing actually changes but that is the second state so you can see my cursor actually changes to a hand and that is the second state okay and that is the hover State so I can go ahead and make this link change different color a different color while I'm hovering over it let me actually zoom in a little bit more and then when I click down on this link you can see that it has now changed to a red color so this is the active State so while I'm holding down this link is active and as soon as I let go I start going through to my YouTube channel and when I go back here you can see that the link has now turned purple and that means that I have visited this link so that is the last state the visited state okay so let's go ahead and just clear my history out here okay so I'm just going to go ahead and clear out and this should make it so that my link has never been visited again okay so now let's go and actually style these different states so by default you can see that the link is actually blue and is underlined so let's go ahead and actually change this up a little bit we'll change the color to green and let's take the text decoration away so text-decoration:none so that means that it must not be underlined now let's go ahead and style the hover State so we can change this color to red and we'll put the underline back in so it text-decoration:underline and now we can style the active State so this is basically while we are clicking down on the link and we'll change that color to mmm no orange and text decoration still underlined actually we don't even need to include this because it will inherit the underline from the hover State okay and for visited we can go ahead and set the color to something that we haven't used before so we've got green red orange I don't want to use blue because that was the e fault so let's go ahead and use gray I guess let's go ahead and use pink I don't know if pink is actually actually a color but we'll try and text-decoration:none so basically we don't want it underlined anymore once it's been visited okay so let's go back yet and click refresh and as you can see we now have a link that is going to change every time the state actually changes so remember before by default it was blue and underlined if the link had not been visited now it's actually green and if I go ahead and hover my mouse over it it's changed to a red color and it actually has the underline styling in there and now when I go ahead and hold down on the link so this is the active State it has changed to an orange color and it's still underlined because it inherited the underline from the visited or the hover State and now when I let go of this and let the actual page load when I go back here you can see that I have a pink link so in other words it's now been visited so it's in the visited state which we set the color to pink okay so that's how to style links on your web page and as always don't forget to subscribe
