hello guys welcome to my channel this is the first tutorial in this brand new series of tutorials on HTML and in this tutorial I'll be talking to you guys about what hTML is and the prerequisites for this course and also what I'll be covering in this course right so HTML stands for hypertext markup language and it's not a programming language it's a language that web browsers understand right and it's also not the only technology that's used to make websites you know you usually use HTML in conjunction with the other popular technologies like CSS or JavaScript and in this course though we are only going to focus on HTML and we are not going to check out CSS or JavaScript right and you know couple of things that I would want you guys to do if you are going to follow along this course watch all the tutorials you should be having at least two web browsers installed on your system right so if you are a Microsoft Windows user you would probably be having internet explorer already so what you can do in that case is you can download and install Google Chrome or Firefox and if you're a Mac user then you probably use Safari so you know in that case you can download install google chrome or firefox again and just make sure that whatever examples we discuss in this course you know you check them out across different web browsers and even the HTML that you you know write on your own just make sure that whatever code you write looks the same across different browsers and this is very important because you wouldn't want to ever make a website that looks one way or functions one way in one browser and functions in a different way on another browser another thing is that you would also need a good text editor and again if you are a Microsoft Windows user then Microsoft Notepad would probably be your default text editor and notepad is not a bad program it's a good piece of software but it doesn't fulfill all our requirements right so I love notepad plus plus it's a free tool that you can download and install from the intern right and you know it provides a syntax highlighting feature which allows me to detect bugs in my websites so it makes debugging very easy and you know even otherwise I like the look and feel of the software it provides lot of features and it's a good software so you can just try it out and you know you can try out other text editors too if you want and you can see which one you like the most and you know you can stick to that and if you prefer working with Microsoft notepad then that's fine too but you cannot use a you know word processing software like Microsoft Word because when you save a text file in Microsoft Word lot of other information gets saved along with the you know the text which web browsers don't understand so you cannot use Microsoft Word but you can use a Microsoft notepad right so over here I have a very simple HTML document for you guys and you guys must have noticed that I have saved this file with the name tutorial - one and it has the extension dot HTML right and this is very important so even if you're going to use Microsoft Notepad you would have to save all your HTML documents with the extension dot HTM or dot HTML because only then will web browsers understand that you know these are HTML files and would process them accordingly so anyway what I have in this file is the doctype declaration on line number one and it's very simple you have the exclamation symbol and the word doctype that's be Oct ype in capital letters a space and then the word HTML and you have all of this enclosed between oh the less than symbol and the greater than symbol and some people also like to call these the opening and closing angular brackets right and the purpose of having this in this file is that you know this instructs web browsers that whatever follows you know after this declaration in the file is all HTML right so it's kind of like a warning to web browsers and you know this is the html5 way of including the doctype declaration the you know older version of HTML required us to also include a ddd and some more fancy text which fortunately would not have to remember now because you know html5 has made our lives so much more simple so anyway you have to include this in all the web pages that you make and on line number three you have the opening HTML tag and on line number 18 you have the closing HTML tag and all the other HTML elements have to go between the opening and closing HTML tags right and although the doctype declaration takes the form of an HTML tag it's not actually an HTML tag right so you know what I mean by that is that the HTML tag also is enclosed between the less than symbol and the greater than symbol but you know this is a you know something that is a part of the HTML language whereas this is not an HTML element right it's something that you have for the sake of your web browsers but you know this is not going to change the functionality of your web pages in any way however this is a requirement you need to have this if you don't have it then you know web browsers won't render your page at all right so it's very simple you have the lesson symbol and the greater than symbol again and then in between these two symbols you have the word HTML right and you have a corresponding closing tag as I said earlier on line number 18 the only difference between this and this is that in this stack that is the closing tag you have the forward slash before the word HTML right and any HTML document is going to have two sections now it's going to have a head section and it's going to have a body section so whatever you're going to put within the body section of your HTML document is going to be displayed within the main window of your web browser whereas what are we going to put in the head section is not going to be displayed within the main window but you know you would save things like you know description about your web pages or you know information about the author or you know if you would want to you know refresh your page after every few seconds and that's also going to be done through a tag in the haste in the head section and then you know the title of the page goes in the head section as well so you know for that you have the title tag and that's on line number five you have the opening title tag and on line number seven you have the closing title tag and in between these two times you have you know some text structure of an HTML doc and you know let me show you guys how this page looks you know when I open it in a web browser so you know I've opened it in google chrome here and as you see you know over here at you know you know at the top of the page you know the title of the window says a structure of an HTML Dokken if I keep my pointer on it i can even read it it's structure of an HTML dog so you know this is where it comes from it comes from the head section and more specifically it comes from whatever you have between the title tags right and I do not have any more elements in the head section at the moment but you know as you move along the course I talk about more things that you can include in the head section to make your website more search engine friendly and you know how you can do some other interesting stuff you know through the elements that go within the head section and then I have the body section you know which again is very simple you have the word body between the lesson and the greater than symbols the opening tag on line number nine and the closing tag on line number 17 and in between you know the opening and closing body tags I have two more elements first one is the h1 element and this is you know if you want to have a heading and the largest possible heading go you know by default less DML standard and then you also have a paragraph you know which is included through the ptang so you the opening P tag is on line number thirteen in the closing P P tag is on line number 15 so between the opening h1 tag and the closing h1 tag I have the text this is the heading and between the opening and closing P tags I have the text as simple as it gets so you know this is how the site looks if you open it in a browser so obviously that the the heading is is you know is bold and it's bigger and the paragraph text is smaller right so I'm going to talk about these elements you know individually in the next few tutorials and also collectively again maybe but you know in this tutorial I just wanted to show you guys the structure of a basic HTML document so you know these are things that you would have to include and I'm going to talk about the significance of each of these in more detail later on but you know for the time being just try to you know copy this code down and you know put it in a text file save it with the HTML extension and open it in a web browser just to see that you know everything works fine right so I hope you guys had fun watching this tutorial I assume the next one till then take care and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't already
