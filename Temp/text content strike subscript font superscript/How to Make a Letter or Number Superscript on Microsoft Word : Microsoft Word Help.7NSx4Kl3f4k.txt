hi I'm Christina and today I'm going to show you how to make a letter or number superscript in Microsoft Word so if we open up our Microsoft Word here let's have a little a couple of test cases so superscript 1 a so now I'm just going to make the 1a into a superscript so when we do is highlight it highlight 1a on the top right here we'll click on home and inside the text format section I'm just click on this icon right here which is the superscript so let's I click on that it turns 1a into a superscript now if I want to do the reverse and make something a subscript I'll to do is the same thing highlight subscript 1 B so highlight that click on home again and on the left of the superscript bun is a subscript so I'll click on that and turns 1b into a subscript so that is how you make a number or letter a superscript or subscript in Microsoft Word
