in this video we're going to take a look at relative positioning and we have examined pretty much every type of positioning so far except for relative so we'll go over that in this video now to understand relative positioning we also need to talk about static positioning and absolute positioning as well now we've already talked about absolute positioning and we've already talked about static now you may say wait a minute when did you talk about static positioning I haven't heard of that term yet well we have talked about it it's the default positioning the browser sets for an element and so it means it's in the flow and we've talked all about the flow so static is the flow so we already know what that's all about and right now if you take a look at the web page all of these elements the body the div the paragraph elements this div and it's paragraph elements are all in the flow by default they are all static because I have not specified that they are relative I have not specified an absolute position so by default everything is in the flow and that's a good thing now just to emphasize that point let's go ahead and put in a position a static position for this square down here and you're going to see that it doesn't move so we'll do that over here and we'll just put in static let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and you can see it didn't move because it already was in static that's the default so we're not accomplishing anything by doing this so let's go ahead and remove that and save this now relative and absolute positioning are pretty much the same thing they use the same properties atop a bottom a left and a right and same thing for absolute top bottom left right and you will remember when we did the absolute positioning when we put a pixel count here so if we say 10 pixels from the top it'll move it down 10 pixels from the top if we said 10 pixels from the left it'll move it 10 pixels from the left now the way this works you rarely will use all four of these properties you will either specify a top or bottom and a left or right but not all four so you'll pick one top or bottom and then you'll pick one left or right so for instance for relative which we're going to start out first we'll take top and a left will specify that and so let's do that now so I created an ID for the square so let's go ahead and update that here and I'll just copy and paste this in here so that's what we're doing we're going to put in a position of relative and we're going to save five pixels from the top and five pixels from the left and let's go ahead and put that in for our paragraph right here our red paragraph here because I created an ID for that fourth paragraph so let's go ahead and copy and paste the same parameters okay all right so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh this and there you can see it moved a little bit about actually this pixel thing got lopped off and I copy and paste so let's go ahead and put that in here and we'll save this again sorry about that and we'll refresh this and there you can see now the way relative positioning works and here's the key point position determined by first static element it touches so in this case so let's take a look first at the paragraph and it's actually the same thing for the square both of these ran into the first static element which was this paragraph on the top so it is five pixels down from the edge of this paragraph static element okay that's in the flow and it's also five pixels from the left of the div which is a static element right our main one we haven't put any positions in here so this is by default static so again it hits this paragraph static element and then on the left it hits the div and so that's relative position it's relative to the static elements around it and so that's the big difference between relative and absolute read this statement right here position determined by first non-static element so what does that really mean absolute will pay absolutely no attention to any static element so it will ignore all these paragraphs and even the divs themselves because they are static it will only render against the browser window actually because everything aesthetic it won't even pay attention to the body because the body is by default static and to emphasize that point let's switch this to absolute now we're just going to play around with the square now so let's get rid of the position parameter for paragraph let's save this and keep an eye on the square we're just going to switch this to absolute and we're going to save this we're keeping the same properties so let's go ahead and refresh this and boom look at that it's now rendering up against the browser window that's because like I said all the elements within our page are static so it won't pay attention to anything in our HTML document it will render right up against the browser window it has to stop somewhere and that's where it stopped and to emphasize that let's actually switch this around let's actually switch the top and let's say the bottom and let's switch this to right and let's go ahead and save this well refresh our page again and now it's rendered down on the bottom right side of the browser and again it paid no attention to any of our div or paragraph elements because they are all static now you might ask the question well how do I get this absolute positioned element to stay within this div element tag how do I get it to stay inside here and there is a specific way to do that and it actually involves using relative and the way we do that is we actually have to create a position in here for relative so let's do that we'll just copy and paste this in here and again we're working against our main two element and we'll switch this to relative we'll hit save now when I hit refresh this Square now should go over to this divs bottom right so if we hit refresh boom there it goes because now take a look this main to now is no longer static it's non-static because we switched it to relative so now this square can no longer escape the div because it ran into its first non-static element and that stopped it now if you take a look at our main two div we didn't even have to put any properties we only had to turn it into a non-static element and that stopped this Square from moving outside our div so again is not really using relative it's actually acting more like a static we just flipped it to non-static by using this position but we didn't put any properties in here so it's really acting more like a static element even though it isn't I guess that's the best way to describe it so that's one of the ways you can use relative and that's actually one of the big ways you can use raw positioning now let's switch this paragraph again back to relative so we'll do that and let's actually do another top and we'll put in a left and let's save this will hit refresh whoops nope sorry we wanted this relative and I copy pasted absolute okay let's save this again and there you can see the paragraph now has moved five pixels from this static element and from the left five pixels from the div element now usually you will not use relative positioning in your main content panels that's just not the way you're going to do this because if you take a look this looks kind of weird right these three paragraphs look much better because they are in the flow now if you wanted to align these with this paragraph you'd have to use relative positioning on the rest of these and that's just not a good way to do your website so I only use relative positioning for a few different scenarios one of them is what I just showed you where we need to set something at an absolute position within your main content panel and you need to keep it within that content panel then you will set the div to relative just to make it non static and that will keep the absolute position element inside your div so that's really one of the primary ways you use relative you actually won't use it to move around content in your main content panels but there are a couple scenarios where you will use it for smaller panels such as your navigation bar where you need to nudge something and so I'll show you that right now so I'm just going to go ahead and close all these out and I'll pull up a nav bar to show you how it's used in a smaller panel okay so here I have a horizontal menu in a navigation bar and like I said relative positioning is good to use if you have to do things very small you don't want to use it out in your large content panels but you can use it for smaller purposes like I said inside your nav bar where you have to nudge something a little bit and I'm going to show you an example of that right now now this is a horizontal menu don't worry about this right now we'll be talking about this in a few videos but for now I want to show you how I'm using relative positioning with this horizontal menu now you can see I've specified it right here and we're using this against the Hoover remember the Hoover is when you hover over a link and you can format certain things in this case we're just setting a background to black but you will notice here that there's a little green right here at the bottom you can see that can't you see that so it hasn't completely covered the area and that's where relative positioning is nice to use so we just need to alter this a little bit so if you take a look again there's a little bit of green here we want to nudge this down a little bit more and by the way you can use minus values for the top bottom and left/right properties and I'll explain why I'm using a minus value when we do horizontal menus but again we want to nudge that down a little bit so 0.5 didn't really work let's set this to 0.3 and let's save this and let's refresh this and now you can see it pretty much covers the entire area so again that's what you will use relative for to nudge things just in the smallest little way we wouldn't want to set this to absolute because then it wouldn't respect any of the static elements around it so again that's why we want to use relative here rather than absolute positioning okay that is a good start on relative positioning I will see you guys in the next video
