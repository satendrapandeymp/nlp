hi there in this video I will show you how you can use the web starts iframe app to embed any URL into your web starts website so for this example I'm going to be embedding a Shopify cart into my web starts website Shopify of course provides a nice ecommerce platform but they don't really provide you the ability to create a beautiful front-end into your website so what I'm going to do is click on apps and then choose the iframe embed app next I'm going to enter the URL of the Shopify cart into the field provided and click OK notice that the Shopify store will be added to my web page and I can then drag and drop it wherever I would like it to appear you can also use the handles to resize the cart or iframe in this example and then when I'm ready I can simply click save and it will be published to my live website you can view it by clicking on view site and then if I'd like I can click within this iframe to order a product or display my cart or more information about my particular products so that's it for this video hope you found it to be helpful don't forget to visit web starts com to create your very own free website
