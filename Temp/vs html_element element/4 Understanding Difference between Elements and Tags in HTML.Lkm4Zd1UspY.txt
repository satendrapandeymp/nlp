welcome back guys my name is oblong and I will be teaching you something about estimating for a difference it won't be CSS I was just gonna say that I am continuing on skills but no I guess I wanted to turn this out and this is like you know one of my aha moments of computer science when I really understood the difference between tags and elements you come across people you know who continuously may launch these two words without actually meaning either of them or like they don't understand what the mean when they speak and I'm not talking of small people I mean this may be computer geeks great people I mean forms developers all of the advanced people also sometimes actually get mixed up between this two words so it often bad practice to mix this two terms and it's good to move like what they actually mean and this tutorial is more or less gonna be a part of my HTML series and also a part of my aha moments of computers play this series more or less let us first understand what element means now when you see something like this written many people sometimes say I'll title deck title tag title I don't wanna know mama door that is crap basically the entire thing is called a title element it comprises off the opening tag the closing tag and the content in between this saw you know content elements which have a opening tag a closing tag and something like a content in between another example is the a the anchor element the anchor element also has this just yeah so this is the opening tag this is the closing tag and there is content in between so I mean if you are wondering that why the opening tag is so I mean so distanced away from its partner no no it has no hate for its partner between the opening tags I mean between the opening tags of the element I mean if you call it as this small sweet boy out there a which is the first two are linked you will see there certain which you write and this is called as an attribute so if this entire thing is basically the link element and why why do we not have a closing tag for the link element do this actually but why don't we have a proper opening and a closing tag for a link element first understand that is this type of elements are called a void element you will see that there is no content here if you carefully notice the mark-up of this page you will see that there is something on a bigger scale if you see even there's a head element inside the head element are the various different elements the title element the link element they are all inside the head element but since we have the title element and other elements those which has contained inside it so head is also considered to be a Content element and so is body because we have elements inside the body which has which are capable of holding content so this elements will also have always the opening and the closing tags the head elements together everything is referred to as the head section and this is referred to as the body section now in html5 we also have a footer section which will be studying later on so this type of elements which have no content inside it that is one of like this link element they don't have a distinct closing tags similarly there is one another exception to the rule and this is basically the break because this is automate like you know in the keyboard you don't need to go to the menu press ENTER it automatically understands that you go to the next line break tags basically are used for giving spaces and obviously it's not it's not in the head sorry basically that all the markups will be in the body so you will see that even this does not have a opening or a closing tag as used to other tags and the bake element will self close itself only with one opening as well as a closing tag so this is one specific exception to the rule but other than that you will now realize that you know any element comprises of the opening tag as well as the closing tag and the continuing between but if the element has no content inside it I mean if I mean see there are two there are two meanings to it it can be you know the anchor tag a person might not keep any content that is a different thing but it has the capacity to hold content so even if like if one does not put content that still we need a closing tag but there are certain elements which don't have the capacity to hold contained in the first place like the link element it does not have the capacity so you don't need a closing tag exclusively for it so I hope the concept is clear you can check later I mean even in this like in the paragraph elements we have basically paragraph element contains things inside it it's capable of containing things inside it otherwise it can also have a simple content inside it so I will just close the paragraph element and I will just write something so this is referred as content so this entire thing forms the paragraph element which comprises of the opening paragraph tag the closing paragraph tag and the content in between since there is content we do definitely need a closing tag so now I mean when I started out for the first time I really got messed up I used to think that this can I mean this is not really needed I mean is it can we simply skip the closing tags or stuff like that but somehow you know with the advent of XHTML things became more defined more logical when you validate your code using w3c or the worldwide consortium validators knowing how this tag should open an end is very important we will later see on examples using input tags elements also I mean at least now if somebody tells you what a tag is you would understand you would not call this a paragraph tag the entire thing you would be referred as a paragraph element which contains the opening and as well as the closing tags with content in between hopefully this makes things clear and I guess this is a part of HTML after this we again resume back to see us and maybe later point of time I will again continue back to HTML and required concepts thank you
