in the last video we talked about how to change the cursor on your web page using CSS but we did not talk about how to use a custom cursor and that's what we're going to do in this video and to do that we have to use the value URL now I created a website folder here that contains of course our index.html and our stylesheet and in there I copied the icon that we're going to use for our cursor which in this case is mail dot ICO now if you want to follow along you can search your C Drive or your computer using this criteria wildcard dot ICO and that should bring up a ton of icons that you can use you can also go to Google and search for free icons and you'll get thousands of results but the main thing is to copy whatever you decide to use to the website folder so you don't have to specify the path and I'll show you that in a minute so let's go ahead and open up our webpage here for just a second so what we're going to do is use a different cursor when we hover over this button and we're going to use this mail icon so let's close this out and of course we have to go down to hover and I've already typed this out so I'll just copy and paste it here now of course cursor is the property the value is URL and this is where we specify the file and as I said we don't have to put a path here because it's in the same folder that our style sheet and index.html are located now what this default does is if the browser cannot load this file it will use the default cursors that the browser loads and so that's a good sort of safety mechanism to set up here so always make sure you put this in okay so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and open up our index.html and we'll now hover over the button and you can see now we've got our custom cursor that we wanted to use okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
