hi everyone so today I'm going to show you how to change your language when you are under Windows 7 that is not ultimate or enterprise and you have Service Pack 1 installed so I had the issue to go from French language to the English one so as you can see I have succeeded in that but it wasn't without a fault well by googling it's by Google my issue well I've found that you had the registry hack to install any language pack with the command when you are like when you are using it as an administrator so but the issue was to find the language packs that we're working with service pack 1 so the trick was to go to this website where you can find all Windows Update language packs file so you have either 32 bits or for me what I wanted was 64 bits English but there is another trick to do yeah note here here when you've downloaded the windows update file language pack so when you try to install it you have the language pack cab that appears and right after disappears so you have to just drag that file somewhere for example desktop and right now you have your language pack cap file that is working with sp1 so you just put it somewhere on your hard drive and follow the usual procedure and you will have well the language you want it Thanks
