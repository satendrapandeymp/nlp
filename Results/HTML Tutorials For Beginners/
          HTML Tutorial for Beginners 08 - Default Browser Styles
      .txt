ah yo people I'm Sean from the net ninja I'm mrs. HTML basics lesson eight default browser styles now I know that I said in the last episode that we'd be covering images in this lesson and we will very shortly I just wanted to do a very quick lesson about default browser styles because I know I've mentioned it a couple of times in previous tutorials I certainly will be doing again in future tutorials so I want to make sure that you understand 100% what I'm talking about when I say this so it's going to be like three minutes tops and it's going to be really beneficial to know this so I'm going to jump back over into the file that we've been working on and here I am back in brackets and this is the HTML document that we've been working on all the way through this tutorial it's not changed one bit since the last episode so all I need to do is open this back up in a browser and we'll do this in Google Chrome and there we go we've seen exactly the same web page that we saw in the last episode and we can see our heading at the top it's quite bold and then we've got a paragraph tag that tag we've got a h2 here a couple of h3s some more paragraphs and you can see that it's all got these this kind of default styling to it I'm going to say that I mean that this h1 is very large and very bold this P paragraph is quite small just large enough for the user to read because it is just a paragraph then we've got the h2 which is slightly smaller than the h1 and then the h3 smaller again and so forth so what this is is the browser looking at the document and it's saying okay well I've got all these different tags here now I want the user who is viewing this he heir of this webpage to know the difference between each tag so it's looking at the h1 and it's saying well this is an important heading so I'm going to make this really bold and big which it does and we've got that right at the top then it's looking at the paragrafix saying well you know this is just a paragraph so I'm going to make this kind of like standard sized text and it does that and then it's looking at the h2 it's saying well this isn't quite as important as the h1 so I'm going to reduce that font size just a little bit and same for the h3 and for the rest of the tags that we use so this you can think of this is like the the browser having this default CSS stylesheet and all these default Styles within this stylesheet the things that are giving these elements the different kind of variations the the different font sizes the different font weights the spacing between the elements that kind of thing so that if there's no CSS the user can still look at the webpage and it's very readable and every browser has its own kind of default styles this is Google Chrome's Firefox has their own version so does internet explorer and so on however they're all pretty much the same there's not much that kind of varies between them so there we go and this has been default browser styles I hope you understand that now and if you don't just give me a comment down below I'll answer all your questions if you like these videos make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next lesson where we will be doing images see you guys then you
