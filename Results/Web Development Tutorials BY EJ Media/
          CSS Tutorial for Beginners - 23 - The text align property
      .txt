welcome to the twenty-third video on beginning CSS in this video we're going to take a look at the text align property and you can see here it has three values Center right and left so let's go ahead and open up our webpage that we've been working on and you'll see here that our headers are aligned to the left and most of the time you want your headers actually to be centered so let's go ahead and use the text align property to accomplish that so let's close out of this and let's open up our style sheet and so here's our h1 selector and here's our h2 selector and so let's go ahead and copy this one and we'll just paste this into the h1 selector well paste it into the h2 selector let's go ahead and save our style sheet and let's open up our web page and there you can see we've got our headers nice and centered now now the nice thing about this property is that if you resize the window the text will remain centered you see that it will stay centered so that's nice as well and so again there are three values center right and left and you can go ahead and play with the right and left values with some of the other text if you want okay I will see you guys in the next video
