alright guys welcome to your 30th I think I'm not sure that's going to be embarrassing if I'm wrong but I'm going to say the xxx html5 tutorial and before I continue I just want to remind you guys if you are too lazy to type this code or if you know you're making a mistake or something I'm going to be putting all this code from my HTML file CSS file and also the JavaScript file that we're going to be making in a couple minutes on my website it's actually going to be on my forum under the web development section so go get it it's free there you go so now that we programmed everything let me go ahead and show you guys what we did so far we pretty much programmed everything made our skin all nice read added border and put our play button to the left it's time to go ahead and start making those default bars and progress bars now remember in our navigation section on the bottom navigation section and it's a tongue-twister we have the play button and we also have the default bar or progress bar so let's go ahead and jump right into that the first thing we need to style is that default bar so it has an ID of can you guess it default bar and this is pretty much if you don't before your video even starts playing this is what's going to appear at the bottom but one second I got an itch in my ear oh yeah that was definitely relieving so let me go ahead and the position is this of this can't type and talk at the same time is going to be relative now we need to specify the position because we're going to put the progress bar inside here and change the position of that so it's better to specify things whenever you're working with positions even if the default is you know relative or something it's always good to specify it so now what I want to do is I want this progress bar but right up against this play bar so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be floating this to the left is row as well so float left and this makes it appear right after that play button now what I want to do is I want to get this I cannot talk today I might as well just drop kick myself in the mouth I want to give this progress bar a set width so I'm going to be setting this width to 600 pixels now this is what I was warning you guys about you see how our entire video player skins width is 700 that means it's 700 from here to here now our play buttons width is 70 and our default bar is 600 so just make sure that whenever you add up your default bar and your play button that it does not exceed the total width of your skin notes your bar is going to be from like here to here and it's going to look funny make sure it's less so that it can fit nicely inside your skin so that's one thing you may want to look out for watch out for ever heck you want to say it so now I'm going to go ahead and give it a height and I'm just going to go ahead and give a height of 16 pixels and that is because I'm going to be adding a border to this and also some padding so once I do those I want to compensate and make it somewhat around the same height as that so give it a height a little less so you can add some padding and it won't you know be so much different and just give a padding of like 4 pixels that should be enough and also like I said I want to give it a border now I want to mention this whenever I'm making my own players I don't add a border but for the sake of this tutorial just so you guys can really see what's going on I'm going to add a border to this default bar so give it a border of something like I don't know 2 pixels solid black don't give it like 4 pixels or anything that's just kind of overkill and now I'm going to give a background of yellow so let's go ahead and refresh this and see what we got so now as you can see if you didn't understand what I was talking about before you can clearly see now what we're going to be having is a default bar right here now this isn't going to change at all however inside here we're going to be making a progress bar which is just going to be like this but a different color in the progress bar is actually going to move as our video is playing so right now we hit play nothing happens but I want to mention this the things we talked about we floated it to the left and that's why as soon as this play button stops this starts right here it has a width of hundred pixels so this 600 plus the 70 right here gives it less than 700 that's why it fits nicely inside our skin it has the height of 16 plus some padding plus this border I don't know if you guys can see this let me scroll in but there's a border a black border around here and that's what I was talking about I don't usually make it whenever I'm you know making my own for my websites and stuff but uh just teaching you guys I want to tell you guys that you can indeed have a border if you want in the background I usually make mine white or light gray but I want to make it yellow just so you guys can clearly see what's going on now the only other thing we need to add is our progress bar now I cannot wait to show you guys this because once I do you guys are going to understand everything so remember our progress bar goes inside our default bar pretty weird on well let me go ahead and show that to you guys now it had an ID of progress bar hopefully I spelled that right let me just go ahead and do this go ahead and copy that shiz and paste it so I make sure you don't mess up anything progress bar and the very first thing I want to do oh got the hiccups now great timing for those position and I want to change this to absolute and this is because we need this pretty much not relative to anything we need it to be spaced absolute relative to this default bar listen just put absolutely I can't really explain positioning because we have a bunch of elements on there but that's what you need next you need a default width and I'm just going to set mine zero pixels now I want to mention this as you play your video the width of this is going to change however it's going to change through JavaScript we're going to be changing this setting through JavaScript but by default before you even play your video at all we're going to give a default width of zero which pretty much means don't even show up at all so now we want to give it a height and just make the height the same height is default bar and it's going to go ahead and appear like it's inside thanks to this padding right here so I'm going to go ahead do something later on you guys can see what's going on but after this you want to give a background different than your default bar so go ahead and copy this and instead of yellow give it a background like a blue or something now if you just go ahead and save it right now and refresh nothing happens why is that because it has no width whatsoever however go ahead and change this to like 250 and refresh and check it out so what's going to happen as you can see is we got a bar that's 250 Y as our video is playing this blue progress bar is going to grow and grow and grow and when our video ends it's going to get to the end so that is what's going to happen and as you can see we got this default bar this yellow bar in this blue bar is the same height but thanks to that padding that is why this blue bar looks like it's inside this yellow bar so whenever I say default bar from now on I'm talking about this yellow thing and whenever I'm talking about progress bar I'm talking about this blue thing now the reason it appears so wide right now is because we just changed it to 250 for demonstration purposes but go ahead and set that to 0 by default now whenever we play our video we want this to grow and grow and grow however we can't do that strictly through HTML and we can't do that through CSS for that we need JavaScript and that's why I was stressing JavaScript in the last couple tutorials because that's when it's going to come in handy whenever we're programming this video player so for now make sure you got everything looking pretty and make sure whenever you change the width of this progress bar that it changes the size of it and that's where we're going to be programming through javascript in the next couple tutorials but for now thank you guys for watching over you subscribe and I will see you guys later
