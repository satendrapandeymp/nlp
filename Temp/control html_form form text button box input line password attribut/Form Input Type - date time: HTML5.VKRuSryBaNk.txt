let us look at date picker of html5 well if you are into programming from a long time you know how difficult is it is to validate the user input especially if it is a date time month week or local timings or global timings etc html5 makes it easier with some of these input types let me start with date input type let's have a look at it in the browser so it gives a nice date picker and look at the format here if you want to give the value directly you can use these arrow marks select the fields select item and you can increment and decrement or you could use this date picker directly you have time type you could select power minute and seconds you can even go to fractional fractions I'll I'll show it later or on our blog follow the link present in the description section of this YouTube video and date time isn't supported by chromate you could it's supported by opera but well dead time local is supported by Chrome let's have a look it fetches the date time from the local machine on which the user is present you could directly use this date picker increment set the time am/pm etc also you could have week type let's have a look well here in this case you could select the whole week here the fortieth week you could select the month navigate here and then select the entire week let's have a look at it again you could select it and increment the year to 2013 and you can decrement here like the number and range fields and the month type so html5 has made it lot easier you could increment decrement well you could even use min max similar to that of number and range you could even use step I'll show you with the min and Max well some of the applications need to be need to have a certain range of dates in this case I'll limit the input month to certain months well I'll make 2002 from 0 1 that is January well I will make 2013 January 2 2013 September I'll this is the format to specify the month to limit between the min and Max values let me show you in action starts from January you keep on navigating and it can't go past September because that's the maximum limit you could even specify a step here so this min Max and step is present for all these time date date time date time local week and month input types for all those formats to specify min Max and step visit the link present in the description section of this YouTube video and please pass on this video to your friends on Google+ Facebook LinkedIn Twitter StumbleUpon etc stay subscribe to techno tip calm and techno tip plot or J and our YouTube channel and don't forget to like this video on YouTube
