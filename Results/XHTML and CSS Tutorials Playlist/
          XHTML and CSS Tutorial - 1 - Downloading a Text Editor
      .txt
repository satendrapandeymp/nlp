what's going on guys my name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very first XHTML and CSS tutorial now in case you're like yeah I accidentally clicked this video I don't even know what XHTML is so I'm just going to exit well hold on just a second let me explain XHTML and CSS is the language that you use in order to create sweet websites so I'm going to assume that none of you guys have ever created a website before or maybe you did with a program like Dreamweaver and you wanted to know more in-depth how to create a website well in this tutorial series I'm going to take you from total newb to total expert web designer we're going to be covering all the basic concepts and also some pretty advanced stuff so stick with me and by the end of these videos you're going to be an excellent web designer so first let me show you guys an example of what XHTML is go ahead and open up your web browser hopefully you're using Google Chrome because it's the best in my opinion and go ahead and right-click anywhere on the page and click view page source now a new screen opens and it's all this computer mumbo-jumbo that we really don't know what it is this is actually mostly XHTML and CSS all these little symbols and all these little class equals whatever all this little crap we can under what the heck do you guys hear that's iron it's like a big fire going on behind me anyways I can easily distract it so anyways by the end of these tutorials you're going to be learning what all of this stuff means right here and you're going to be learning how to take this code and turn it into right here a beautiful website entrepreneurs who create the corporate world I'm going to have to check that out later like I said I get easily distracted but anyways check it out the first thing that we need in order to create sweet websites is actually a program on our computer called a text editor and with this text editor we can type in some code and we can turn it into something that looks pretty cool to a browser and a browser is pretty much a program like Firefox or Internet Explorer or Google Chrome it's the program that shows websites so anyways like I said the first thing we need is a text editor now you actually don't need to download anything if you have Windows you have a program on your machine called notepad so go ahead and open this and look at this you can actually create websites and type XHTML code in here but I mean look at this can they make a program that's any more boring seriously black and white and it has like two options what the heck so anyways I'm going to recommend it not to use notepad and I'm going to recommend an even better program the best program that you can use in order to type XHTML and CSS is called notepad plus plus now if you're going to do any serious coding or a web design I highly recommend getting this program and best of all it's free so go ahead and go to Google and I'll show you how to get it go ahead and type in notepad plus plus hit enter and click on the first link that pops up this is notepads website now look for a link that says download and well your website may change depending on when you're watching the Torro but click download the current version and now you see a bunch of different options right here zip package binary the one you want is the Installer it's pretty much a nice easy wizard to guide you through the installation so go ahead and click that and now you're going to have a file that downloads on your computer go ahead and save this and it's going to download and it just download so if you're using Google Chrome go ahead and double click that and say do you want to allow yes you want to allow it so now let's go ahead and select English unless you're you know foreign or something if so then how the heck are you understanding me right now anyways go ahead and click OK and I'm not going to read that because I'm Way too lazy press Next I agree probably to sign my life away but big deal I'll get over it click next to this all the defaults look good and press install now it's going to go ahead and install in your system right now and then make sure you have run notepad actually don't click that and make sure you hit finish so now you have notepad plus plus installed on your computer and here's what I'm going to recommend go ahead and make an icon for it right on your desktop because you're going to be using quite a bit in order to make an icon on your desktop and this isn't only with notepad but any program go ahead and click your little Windows button right there and click all programs now you should have a folder called notepad plus plus if you expand this you're going to have an application in here called notepad plus plus this is the program that we just downloaded so if you want to turn this until icon on your desktop go ahead and right click it and press sent to desktop this is going to go ahead and create an icon or a shortcut right on your desktop so now it's a lot easier than having to go through this thing so now go ahead and double click this and open it in BAM look at that how beautiful is this a brand new program in order to type XHTML and CSS and best of all it's free how sweet is that so anyways that's all I'm going to teach you guys for this tutorial in the next tutorial we're actually going to be typing some code and making our very first website but for now I just want to tell you guys download this program get everything set up and if you have any questions or anything goes wrong just leave a comment
