this come type in table give yourself some room and then close that table like so so you've almost made a table now you're gonna need to add its part so the table rope which will go across each vertical step so make that and then close that and then inside here is each cell so these go across horizontally and you know as we do this you'll understand it more cuz tables can be a little bit complex to understand alright so in this first one let's just have a word here and refresh now you'll see place right here now you'll notice it looks just like a regular word that's because the table doesn't have a border onto it so go up to the table add border equals and you can start out at Worman and now you'll see these small border this can be increased of course to how thick you actually want a border around your table so this is one cell so like say a table row is just straight across horizontally and table cells or T DS they'll add to that horizontal and feasible add vertically so to add another one just type in TD remember this is inside the table row and then we can type in our second thing so make sure to close all these T DS and open them correctly so now you'll see it adds on to our table row horizontally again we can just keep adding to this say we weren't in a ward now and then close that TV and it'll keep adding on to it okay so we let's go down now so let's get out of this table room and let's create another one so this will go down and make another one give yourself some room close that off and then inside this at a table cell and this is gonna be the first one so this will be under the word place so let's say this guy got first closed that TV and now you'll see it adds that cell and then moves down because of the table row so if we want to put one under the runner then we'll have to add another cell on our second row and this can be under a runner so this would be a name [Music] okay finally an award let's add another cell or second row and this can be let's just give this guy 50 bucks all right so that's the third one let's have another row so space down and add another T or so y'all getting the hang of it it's pretty pretty straightforward but like say once you start making a lot of these they can get a little confusing so let's add another row and another cell TD so this will be our second place guy close that TV and now you'll see it adds a second one so let's go ahead I'm just gonna speed things up a bit change this guy's name and change how much he gets all right so that filled all of that out pretty quickly all right so what if we want a header to this up at the top okay so let's go up to the very top of this right here and space down right under the table and add another table row and close that off and this time we weren't a TD value and let's just say this one is a contest and close that TD okay so we have this but like say it's just warm sell we want it to move across all three of these so a way we can do that is inside of this cell just type in Co L span that's column spin and it'll span it across as many as you want so right now it's at one because it's only spanning across one if we set this to two now when we refresh this notice it covers two columns okay now that's not exactly it so let's go ahead and change that to three and now it goes all the way across but this doesn't look like months of ahead right so let's go ahead and align this one Center so this is in the TD or the cell so we're just affecting this individual cell right now so now it's aligned I also want to bold this text so go to the text and type in B and then close that B right after the text all right that looks a little more a little more professional how we want but this is also kind of wordy there's another cell value it's just like TV but it's a heading so type in th so like say this is gonna do the same things as a cell would except this time it's gonna give it a center alignment as well as a bold automatically now you'll notice we will still have to span this across all three of our columns that doesn't change but look how much less coding it's gonna take to do what we originally did with aligning and such so just to let you all know table headings are available as well all right just as you can span across horizontal clean you can also span across vertically right say we wanted to cover two rows at a time so let's add another cell out here beyond a ward that says total warnings so let's go to our row that has all these and let's add another cell to this and this one's going to say total so close that up and now you'll see it adds a little lonely guy out to the middle thank you and now that we've added a fourth cell let's go ahead and crease our contents together cover that soak up here words three change that to four and now we'll see it covers the whole thing okay so these two cells let's start on the first row with the fifty so go down here to fifty and let's add another cell and this one's going to be the combined value of the two so $80 and save that okay so that's out to here but now we want to stretch this value down into our fourth row actually is what this is so what we can do is in this cell right here go ahead and add row spin okay so this will go down vertically so as of now it's at one but we want to cover two cells so go ahead and do that and now look at this it spreads out vertically and covers that middle value right thing so using row span you want to start at the first one and then you're gonna use and then go down and then using horizontally spanning or call spanning then you start at the first cell and spread it across like that all right now this thing is a little bit small still so let's go ahead and go to the table itself and let's add some spacing to this so type in cell spacing and then this will increase the sale spacing so we put a number five here and do this now you'll notice there's space in between these things so if we go up to ten and just keep adding these values look how much space in between each spill so right there alright and then now inside of the cells this is called cell padding it spelt like that and this will increase how much is inside these so let's go ahead and add 10 to that and now look how much space is in between the words notice before when this is at zero you know the line is right up against the words so increasing this will give yourself some room for your words to breathe in each cell I also want to Center this table so under the table we can go ahead and align this whole table to Center on our page so now it's centered and also I want to Center some of these values so Jake for example let's enter that to do that just go ahead and find that value and then in the smiths cell type in align equal center [Music] and that will Center that word as you see right here but I want to Center this whole row so let's go ahead and move this up to the table row value so if you put anything in the table row it's gonna affect everything inside of that so now as we save this notice everything it gets aligned so now let's do it for the second one and you notice also the ad was centerline because that's part of this table row so for this one like say you can type in a line equal Center and that will Center everything inside this row which goes across like this or you can do it each and individually to each one you need so like this alright I also want to bold these so we lend up table headings right let's just go ahead and change these tdys to tea ages and that's all we'll have to do and that'll make all these have a little bit of format and it'll also center align them for us so there we go that looks much nicer all right now for color so up at the table again let's change the whole table color so the background color BG color to tan now again this can be in word value or you can put hexadecimal value which would be the whole six digit number thing but I'm just going to keep it simple if you want a more complex numbers and that's how you do it so now we'll see this all like that I also want to change the border color so let's put this fun place for that somewhere in here just type in border color [Music] all right and now we have a green board color well what if you wanted to change the color of the cells so for example let's change this 50 cell right here go down and find that and in that cell type in BG color so the background color of that we can just go ahead and put green right there and now that individual cell will be green now again to apply it to the whole row just go ahead and move this value right here up to the T or or the table row so now when we run this notice it affects the whole row and again this ad is a part of that row as you'll see because it's in between these values so if you would have just changed these three you would have to individually put this value right here onto each three of these but don't put it on this third one and then that would make it only these two green let's go ahead and put this up here I think that'll look much nicer all right and then they'll contest we can go ahead and put a color right here now because there's only one cell it doesn't matter if we put this in the th or DTR so whichever one you can want to go for that because it's its own cell so let's do BG color equals and white and now we'll see it right here so again because this is just one cell if I cut this and put it up in the TR it'll do the same thing because like say this affects everything within the table value all right so that's it on tables if you all have any questions like say put them in the comments and you know just play around adjust all these and get them to look like you want and also it does not have to have a table border as we specified right here go ahead and set that to zero or just get rid of that board of value altogether and now you'll see it's more blank right there so either put that value to zero or erase that completely and now you'll have just a plain old table all right so thanks for watching guys and I'll see y'all in the next
