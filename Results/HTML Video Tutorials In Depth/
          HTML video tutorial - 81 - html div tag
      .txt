hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML div tag what is the purpose of HTML div tag and when to use HTML div tag we are going to discuss about div tag in this video tutorial first I open the previous page that we created in the previous video tutorial that is default dot HTML page I right click open with the google chrome I right click on default dot HTML page once again open with the notepad in the previous tutorial we have created a document something like this and we applied styles properly you can see we have a h1 tag we have a paragraph we have one more h1 tag we have paragraph we have one more h1 tag we have paragraph and every h1 tag should have a background color Zion and we have given a box shadow and applied a width of 400 pixels that is the reason we have here the background color sine and the width of the h1 is 400 pixels it has shadow you can see similarly every paragraph has a background color gray and text color white and width of 400 pixels and padding of 10 pixels 400 pixels plus padding has 10 pixels so left padding is 10 right padding is 10 total 420 is the width of each paragraph over here let me modify a little bit so I change here with 2 4 20 pixels heading width 2 4 20 pixels file save if you observe now here we have little bit gap right if I say refresh that is filled you can see now heading is also 4 20 pixels and paragraphs are of 4 20 pixels width now I am going to discuss about the div tag first of all div tag is a pair tag let me show here I am going to put a div tag div div opening div tag and closing div tag as it is a paid tag we should write both opening and closing in between I can put some content like hello div demo of course I'm gonna change the title to div tag demo file save go to browser and refresh you can see here is displaying div tag demo and here you can see I have a text hello Dave demo display and now I want to show the attack is a block level tag so what I do here I am going to say here div and I want to apply some styles for example I can apply background gry und background - color and I said P I and K pink color if I say file save as we know that div tag is a block level tag it takes the entire available width if i refresh you can see that entire available width is set to pink color hope you guys are understanding similarly if I create I copy this div tag and paste it down this hello dev demo is going to be displayed on a new line not on the same line file save go to browser and refresh you can see that that content got displayed on the new line it is not displayed in the available space here right that is the reason we say that div tag is a block level tag and it's a paid tag file save go to browser and refresh that is how the web page looks now at present div tag is a generic container tag that is div tag is used to group HTML elements or tags together and create a section for them that means div tag is used to divide web page into various sections like I can create a head section I can create a body section or I can create a sections for physics I can create one separate sections for chemistry I can create one separate section for biology like that and iron i can apply styles on those sections to div tag can also be used to create layouts of web pages i show you different examples of creating layouts by using div tag i hope you remember we have created our own profile by using table tag tables are quite complex to modify if we create a layout of a web page by using table tag then it will be very much difficult to modify the layout that means tables are not flexible for creating layouts of web pages whereas div tags are recommended to create layouts of web pages because div tag helps us to create flexible layout which we can modify at anytime easily i show you examples later now present we proceed further and understand how do tag works as I told you've tagged the container tag that means we can put more than one HTML elements into div tag we can group them together for example here I can create a div tag so here I am writing opening div tag and Here I am writing closing div tag so I am putting these two HTML elements into div tag and we have here background color set to pink if I save file save you will see that this is going to become one section and background will be set to pink if i refresh you can see that we have one section here which has a background color pink and as we know that there is a block level tag it has took the entire width so what I do is I set the width of the div WI D th width I set it to 420 pixels px and this time if I say 5 save go to browser and refresh you can see that only this much part has the pink color set to now we made a section without the div tag it is not possible for example if I remove this to give opening and closing div tag and if I say file save and go to browser and refresh how do I apply a background color pink to both of these together it is not possible for example if I say here if I change the background color to pink here and here also if I change the background color to pink semicolon and if I say file save and go to browser and refresh these are changed to pink color but you can see there is a gap there is a gap of white color right I want to apply there also pink color but it is not possible now so let me set it back to gray and let me set it back to cyan and I say file save go to browser and refresh if I apply the background color to body for example if I say here BG color and say P i NK pink if I say file save and go to browser and refresh it sets the whole body color to pink still I want to make these as a sections I want to create one proper section for physics I want to create one proper section for introduction to chemistry I want to create one proper section for introduction to biology how do I do that here comes the solution by using the div tag and when to use a div tag let me tell you you have to use a div tag only when you don't have any other proper tags to use at present of course I don't have any other tag to use here which helped me to group these two tags together apply a style or create a section so I must and should use a div tag at present in this place so I'm going to say here closing div tag and now of course the background color will be set to pink and the width will be set to 420 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a pink are applied and same thing I can do for every other section so here I am going to say div and closing div and file save go to browser and refresh you can see that here also we have a pink color background set similarly I am going to create div for this also div and here I am going to say closing div I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have a background color set to pink now this one is one section this one is one section this one is one section what else I want is I will modify a few things here first thing I want to modify is I do not want to apply a shadow effect to each headings I want to actually apply a shadow effect to complete section so I cut that and I paste here in the div tag okay so if I say file save this time what happens shadow will be applied to each section or each div tag refresh you can see that now the shadow is applied to div tags you can see that how flexibilities also you can see there is a space we have here in between the heading and the content that is because of margin there is a little bit margin available with respect to paragraph and heading so I can remove that first of all I remove the margin available with respect to paragraph so I go here I say M argi and margin I am going to set to zero pixels I say file save go to browser and refresh okay and that is not changed much let me change the heading marginals margin I set to zero pixels and I say file save go to browser and refresh we don't have any margin you can see there and also can see that all div tags are joined together it's not a good idea so I put a break over here to show that we have section so I create a break here I copy that break tag and paste it here file save go to browser and refresh and see now we have break between each div element I want to make it more still more appealing let me put some padding for the div tag so here I say padding of 5 pixels and I say file save go to browser and refresh so we have a padding around the content to present in the div tag and now I don't want the pink color I will I put white color that looks good actually so I remove this background color pink file save per browser and refresh can see this is how it looks now I can make it still more better headings is going to have BL ACK black color and color of the text I am going to set to white semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that that is how our web page is going to look now we can add some font size also so here I can say font as I said the size or 14-point looks good for paragraph content file save go to browser and refresh and see that even we can make text a lign align justify semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that how the div tag helps us to group elements together and create appealing sections in a web page hope you guys have understood how the div tag will be helpful and when to use div tags at present I hope you guys have understood what is div tag few important points you need to remember that div tag is a paid tag div tag is a block level tag div tag is a generic container tag used to group HTML elements together and create sections for them and apply styles on them and we should remember that div tag is used to divide web page into various sections or it helps us to create layouts of web pages easily and it helps us to create a flexible layout so we talk about div tag more discuss about it later more hope you guys have understood for this tutorial this much is
