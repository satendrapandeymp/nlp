[Music] you you [Music] you you [Music] so continuing with our discussion on HTML in the present lecture we would be talking about tables HTML forms and something called style sheets in HTML now we start with our discussion on HTML tables now you know that we need to compose some data or some text or some other kind of materials in a tabular fashion in a number of different applications for example you know that that means we can show for example the marks obtained by a student in the form of a table the name roll number followed by the marks there are a number of such application where you need to format data in a tabular fashion with possibly margins and lines drawn between the successive elements along the rows and the columns these are the so called tables now in HTML tables can be used not only to store this kind of textual information in a suitably formatted form but in contrast it can be much more general like a particular entry in the table need not be a text it can even be an image there are many application where a number of small pieces of a larger image are stored in the form of a table for example there is a three by three table three rows and three columns and each of the entries store one portion of a bigger image so that when find all the entire images of a table are loaded and are shown together so you can see the whole table so let us see that how such HTML tables can be constructed and can be used well tables as I told you tables are constructed using something called cells so each element in the table is called a cell cells can be organized in rows and columns so there are a few things we need to specify when we are talking about a table number one how many rows are there how many columns are there and in and some sort of a delimiter or a marker that can identify well here one particular cell ends and the next cell starts so there has to be some suitable marker or HTML tag that should uniquely specify exactly where a particular item is ending and another item is beginning similarly it should also specify when a particular row is ending on the next row starting okay so tables can be constructed using the HTML tags table TR and TD of course there is another tack called th we will see it later but these are the three basic tags and a small example is given here firstly the begin table and the end table tags bracket the definition of the table this is the whole definition of the table TR the TR tag stands for table row so here the table row begins and here the table row ends and whatever is in between that is this entire thing this corresponds to the first row of the table similarly we see there is another row which is starting here there is the ending of that row and similarly whatever is in between that is the contents of the second row so you see that using the TR tag we can specify each row of the table so if the table has for exam 100 rows then there will be 100 TR begin and TR n tags spread across the table definition now let us see what happens within a particular row of the table so within a row of the table the tack key D is used to identify our D market the individual cells of the table you say begin TD end TD this identifies the first cell whose content is good similarly TD and n TD bad so this definition within a particular row tells you that there are two elements in a row there are two TD and NT DT D and n TD which means there are two cells in the row similarly if you look at the second row there will be a similar thing definition begins ends begins ends the contents are cute and ugly so you can understand that if you view this table on a browser the table would look something like this there will be two rows and two columns good and bad first two rows cute and ugly in the second row now tables in general can be much more complex than this if you have simple tables like this where items are organized in the form of fixed number of rows and fixed number of columns you can do it like this but there are a number of other ways to do it before going into it let us formally look into the different tags in a little more detail the first and the main tag that is required for using a table is of course the table tag begin and end table and as I've shown in the example these tags identify or defines the beginning and the end of a table definition now as part the table definition there are a number of attributes you can use first one is background color background color can be specified by means of the conventional hexadecimal red-green-blue notation or by specifying the name of a color now background color means when the table will be displayed on the browser there will be a background color across the entire table that you can specify example you can specify your background color will be yellow then the entire table background will become yellow rule says suppose I have a table like this the three rows and two columns rule means whether I want these lines to be drawn between the rows and columns or not rules are rules means whenever the table is displayed whether I want that those lines or rules should be drawn or not and I can specify that which rule I want to draw in which I do which I do not want to draw here you can see that the options are I can specific all which means all the lines will be drawn rows columns everything only rules along the columns will be drawn only rows will be drawn and in some cases like the example of an image I had given there I do not want lines to be drawn between the image pieces so here I will specify none suddenly I specify how thick the lines will be the border attribute specifies in terms of the number of pixels whatever number I give here that is a measure of the width what or equal to 1 will be the thinnest board or equal to 5 will be thicker body page 10 will be even thicker that will tell you how thick the borders will be across the table the rows on the column markers and there is another two--it height here you can specify the total height of the table in terms of the number of pixels or as a percentage of the total available area on the screen here if you specify this the table will automatically resized according to whatever you have specified okay so this is how we can define characteristics about the table definition then comes the tag to define the table row begin TR and n TR this actually defines a row of cells within a table so as the example are illustrated that whenever you have a particular row it must begin with a begin TR and must end with a n TR if there are ten such rows there will be ten such pairs of begin and NTR's in the table definition so these rows can come with a number of attributes of course here this attributes can be defined separately for each individual row because this is an attribute which is corresponding to the TR tag and since there are so many TR tag there is one TR tag per row so you can say that for for each and every row I can have different attribute definitions that would pertain to that particular row now let us see what kind of attribute definitions we can have but here again we can have a background color attribute which will specify a color for that particular row now obviously this row color or background color will override the background color that was specified for the whole table so with the table tag if you had specified some other background color then within this particular background color will overwrite that definition okay and in addition you can specify the cell alignment rules that whether they will be left justified centered right justify or read across the width of the cell so that the left and right margins are justified so you can specify what kind of justification you need okay normally when we compose a table we give a caption to the table a short name which identifies the purpose of the table for the table is all about now in HTML a table caption can be given using the caption tag which is available under the table definition so within the begin caption and end caption you can give any string in between which will appear as the caption this provides a caption for the table but this is one restriction this caption tag if present must immediately follow the table tag and precede all other tags like TR and others this means that you cannot place caption anywhere you want caption must be immediately after the table begin tag they should be caption if you want to give a caption followed by the actual description of the rows and the other information okay next comes the definition of the actual individual cells of the table TD and n TD identifies the boundary of an individual cell definition so if you recall the example we had given earlier for each row there was a begin TR and n TR and within a row for each cell in the row there was a begin TD end TD begin TD end TD so begin TD n TD identifies or D markets and individual cell of the table okay so it defines a table data cell now as I mentioned earlier a cell need not contain only text it can have any kind of content it can be an image or in general you can do some table nesting that means an entire table definition can be nested inside a table that means in place of a cell you can give an entire table definition so a particular cell can contain as if another table smaller table or it can contain an image it can contain basically any kind of content whatever you want to put in the thing is that whatever you put in they will appear on the screen in a suitably formatted form in rows and columns nicely formatted TD can also have several attributes you can specify background color for the individual cells in the same format RGB or the name format and there are some construct column span and row span this we shall be illustrating with some examples column span row span you will be using one of the two both of course also you can use normally we use one of the two but in general you can use both column span means normally when you define a cell of a table if the table has four columns then there will be four cells in the table but in many cases we may want that a particular value or a number that you are showing that should span multiple columns something you'd suppose a table heading marks obtained but under marks obtained they're going to physics chemistry mathematics three columns so you may want that the marks obtained this string to span over the three columns now this call span this attribute exactly allows you to specify that that how many columns it is spanning okay so called span equal to number this actually tells you that the number of columns the current cell should spend similarly row span if there is a row span you may sometimes want that some cells be expanded in size they can span more than one row and appear in that way suitably formatted there so you can use any combination of row span and column span to actually allow a particular element to appear on the table in any particular way you want okay fine there is another attribute th-th is the short form of table header this actually defines a table header cell see th same when you have a table definition suppose you have a table out here normally the first row of the table will contain the header heading then the actual data rows will come there will be multiple columns now usually what we do that the heading which will come here and here and here and here are displayed in a form which is more prominent than the actual data which is appearing in the following rows usually in bold or italics we show it now here this tag th is very similar to the TR column TR tag this is very similar to TR in the sense that this identifies the beginning and ending of a row this also does the same but this is for a special row the heading row or the header row the first row of the table that is the header so th defines the header row and it depends on the browser's of course but most browsers will display the contents you are putting inside this definition in bold and centered which is normally the way we want the table headings to come on the screen when a table is displayed and the attributes are identical to the tea detail even specify a background you can specify the rows and column spans whatever okay so th is a special tag you can use to specify the heading of a table now let us take some very few examples of table definition which shows you some examples of rows and columns panel first we have the table definitions there are two rows begin TR n TR begin TR n TR the first row has a TD a cell definition with a column span of two and that is all there is no more cell and the text inside is hello this actually means that in the table there is only two columns because your first row definition says that you have one cell the column span is two with some value and that is the only cell since the column span is 2 this immediately tells you that there are only two columns that can be fit in the table you look into the second row you see the same thing there are actually two two cells but now there are there is no call span they have been identified by two TD beginner names now if you look at the way the table will get displayed you can understand what this means column spent to means this text hello will be displayed spread across two columns while in the second row the good and day will be displayed as two separate cells okay so in many cases we need to compose a table in this way so you can use this call span like this this is a very similar example this uses row span this says first one table begin row begin row end there is another row begin ruined now look carefully at the first row definition there are two cells which are defined one begin TD end TD there is another begin TD end TD now in the first row definition you see there is a row span equal to two which means there is a row there is the cell which is spanning across two rows and by the side of it there is another cell with a content good now good is not spanning across two rows good spans only one row so the appearance will be something like this as you can see here this hello will be spanning two rows good will be on the right but it will be spanning only one row okay and whatever comes in the second row since hello has already spanned two rows that will start from here onwards so there can be only one cell in the second row day it will come out here okay so when you're using row span you should take take care of this thing that whenever you are spanning a row across multiple rows the following rolls will be getting 1 column less so that whenever you give the road effing ition for the following rows you will be having one less TD declarations cell declarations in them this has to be kept in mind ok this is a third example this shows a table with a border one so the whole table border gets displayed with a light with lines of width 1 I have given a caption with my table this will actually come on top of the table like this the caption of the table will come here then the actual rose first there is a table header this is actually option on this okay there are three rows TR TR and in the first case th tells you that these are the cells of the header okay so first one name and marks as I told you this will be displayed in bold face so they are more prominent while the second and third rows they are using normal TD to define the cells Anil 72 kamal 58 so this example shows you that when you are using the header th to declare the cells so you will be displaying this in bold letters bold font and when you're using TD they will be appearing in normal font but one thing is also clear from this table that all rows including header non header they must be delimited by begin TR and n TR okay this must be there and the other rows and the other means the cells corresponding the rows they will contain either TD or th depending on whether they are a normal row or a header row so this means when you define a table there can be a caption rows each row including the header row must be beginning with a TR ending with a TR and the cell declarations will be using th if it is a header row will be using TD if it is a non header row okay so using this constructs you can construct any complicated or arbitrary table we have given a very few small examples but using these concepts recursively or repeatedly you can construct a table of arbitrary complexity there can be ten columns some entries maybe spanning across columns some rows may be spanning across several fields so you can have any combination of these two some of the entries may be images for example in the examples have given all the examples the table entries are all texts but I can use that IMG tag to include a G for a jpg image in in any entry of the table that will that will allow you to display a particular image as part of a cell in the table okay so this table is a very useful way to represent information when you are showing it as part of our web page now another very important way in which you can structure the information that appears on a on a web page is through the use of something called frames so let us now see what HTML frame actually consists of and how it can be used basically frames constitute a method for dividing the browser windows into smaller sub windows this is the basic idea that we are dividing the window into several sub windows not only that each sub window will display a different HTML document this is unlike a table in a table the entire table definition is part of the same HTML document if there are 10 cells in the table then all the declarations of the ten cells will be part of your same file but now we are talking about something else we are talking about the case where you have a complete page with several portions maybe there are four parts on the first part I am displaying some HTML page in the second part I am displaying an image in the third part I am displaying some other page maybe in the fourth part I am playing music so four different things are happening in the four places so as if I have split my window into four different windows where four different things are happening and the information that are being displayed in the four windows can come from four different places this does not come from the same HTML page that is most important okay so is an example of a page with a frame is shown in the next slide I am showing it let us take this example this is the web page of a conference as you can see I Triple E fourteenth each end test symposium now although it appears in a very nice you can see that on the left side of the page there are some menus which are displayed if you can read properly home page call for papers in this recession paper status etcetera there are so many options now user can click with the mouse on any on reduce option and whatever option is being clicked will get displayed in this central window okay in this central place whatever is displayed on the top this will not change this will remain fixed and some of these sponsors logos are appearing here they will also remain fixed so actually what you see on this screen is a webpage constituting of four different frames okay it says that the frames can display means independent HTML documents now in this frame for example there is one frame like this there is another frame like this there is another frame like this and the remaining is the main frame so there are four frames now the way the frames work as this example shows are different the contents of some of the frames may be fixed depending on the application for which your develop the page the headers and the sponsors information are fixed the left side menu was also fixed but it was of a different type it was a clickable menu there are hyperlinks associated with it and the information you want to see is displayed in the central place so whatever you click on the left menu will appear in the middle part okay so there has to be a mechanism to tell that if I click it this particular document has to be fetched into this particular frame and should be displayed there so there should be ways to do this in frames let us see how it can be done but before that there are some advantages and disadvantage to using frames first let us look at the advantages so as the example shows it allows parts of the page to remain stationary while the other parts can scroll or can change they can unify resources that reside on separate web servers means whatever you are seeing on the different windows they need not be coming from the same web server they can be coming from four different web servers so we are unifying them on the same screen and we are displaying them in a suitable way for browsers which do not support frame will see there is a tag called no frame which tells the browser that if you do not understand frame then you please use some alternative content which you can specify in place of the frame this we'll see later how you can do that these are the mates but some drawbacks are also there well the first and obvious thing is that all browsers do not support frame of course most of the modern browsers do documents nested in a frame is more difficult to bookmark see we are we are habituated with bookmarking a page normally when you bookmark a page the document which is being shown is bookmarked we come back later click it it comes but now four different things are displayed in four different places in for wind or say I can bookmark the entire page but I cannot bookmark an individual frame this I cannot do here okay load on the server can be significantly increased if there are a large number of film because each frame constitutes or consists of an independent web page or a doc web document so if there are four frames four different items have to be fetched so the load on the server will be increasing four times you compare it with the case where there is a single HTML page which was fetched only once fetching a ten kilobyte HTML page takes much less time than fetching for two point five kilo byte pages because there are overheads of connection establishment and termination okay and second lastly this is a problem for search engines search engines cannot very easily handle frames and can identify documents that are located in some particular frame of a page okay now let us look at the tags the main tag with which you can define the frame is the frame set frame set can define a collection of frames or again recursively other frame sets there are some attributes columns rows columns and rows they actually establish the columns establish the number of sizes of columns or vertical frames in a frame set similarly rows will tell you that how many horizontal frames are there because the frames may be divided in any arbitrary we will take some examples there should be ways of specifying how the frames are divided okay so this rows and columns these two attributes can be used to specify that and they relative sizes of the individual frames can be specified in 3-way either by using a number which actually gives you the number of pixels percentage means the percentage of the total available area on the screen or star or asterisk is a relative value relative value means you can specify a like this that well I have two frames one of which has a size of star other as a size of two star which means that the second one will be twice as wide as the first one there are three one you can say star two star three star you can specify the relative widths but the actual width will be dependent on the available space that is there on the screen okay fine now within frame set you have a TAC called frame which defines a single frame there are some attributes frameborder it can be either 1 or 0 1 means a border will be there is 0 means no border whether you want a border or not source equal to a URL will tell you that which page you want to display in that particular frame so the entire URL you have to give there scrolling is an attribute yes/no or auto if you give yes then a scrollbar will automatically come by default no means it will not come by default Auto means if space is not sufficient then the scroll bar will come otherwise it will not come margin which means say means on the available area you are defining a frame margin means on the four sides how much margin you want to keep spacing margin which means on the left and right how much space you want to give margin height means on the top and bottom how much space and you also can assign some name to this particular frame this may be required to cross reference frames as you shall see later that means that why we need to do no frames tag as I'd mentioned this specifies the contents to be displayed by browsers that cannot display frames so whatever is there in between that will be handled only by the old browsers which cannot handle frames but for modern browsers this tag will be not considered or ignored let us take some simple examples here there is an HTML file with some frame definitions out here you see this frame set calls equal to star dot star star dot star means there are two columns both are of equal width you see both frames will be defined like they're of equal width on the left frame you display a page left dot HTM on the right frame you display a page right dot HTM this is how this particular frame will be displayed and in case your browser do not support frames then this particular message will be displayed because this is placed within the no frames tag so this text message will get displayed by the browser's if it does not support frames this is another example where again the frame set definition is here so you see the call so on there are three columns 100 comma two star comma star this means first frame will be a fixed with 100 pixels wide second and third are relative depending on the available space you have the second one will be twice as wide with wide as the third one so in this way you can specify and here we have specified the source for two of them the third one I have not specified so something will be displayed in the first and second one but the third one will remain empty right okay this is a complex example this is an example which also shows that frameset can be nested so this is the whole definition first says that the that the first level frame set has two columns first is 25% this is a person definition so of the total 25% of this space you live for here and the remaining 75% you deform the list and on the left one you display one dot HTM this is here but for the right one there is another frame set so now there are three rows of of height 100 pixels 156 cell 100 pixels so for the first two the pages are 2 & 3 this will be 2 this will be 3 and for the last one again there will be another frame set declaration which says 2 equal size column start dot start this and this where for dot HTM and 5 dot HTM will be displayed so in this way you can actually compose any arbitrary frames and you can put some materials in them whatever you want to like do like and as the example for that conference website at shown earlier showed that on the left side there is a menu if you click something else was displayed in some other frame let us see how this can be done so when a hyperlink is clicked by default the new page will get loaded into the same frame but in that application we really did not want it to do that we would click here and you want that the page would be loaded somewhere here in some other frame okay this is what we require let us see how we can do this the first thing we need in order to do this is to assign a name to the frame where you want the page to appear so whenever you have the frame definition of course you require the source file to be specified up you can also give a name to the frame for example here the name is ABC and from the left when you are specifying the hyperlink you can specify in which target frame that hyperlink should appear like you can specify it in this way using a standard href tag the hyperlink tag you can specify the URL and also you can specify the target frame target equal to ABC so already some frame was defined with a name ABC so when you click on this new page the page will get displayed on that ABC frame so in this way by naming properly you can actually do some cross reference across the frames you click here something appears there you click there something appears here and so on ok so this is how you can do this now there is another thing which is also an important concept in HTML in fact the modern versions of HTML this is something called cascaded style sheets style sheets in HTML allows us to specify typography style and spacing instruction there are some rules I need to define for example it is the heading I want to display heading I want to tell that this is the font size whether you want it in bold whether you want any color what are the rules to be followed and how to attach these rules to one or more HTML documents or to some part of a document these are the things we need to see some examples ch2 is a standard tag for heading second level heading but you can within curly bracket even specify like this within bracket color colon blue this means I am specifying some role for the h2 tag similarly for paragraph P I can specify font size 12 font family verdana sans-serif I can specify so subsequently if I use the P tag paragraph tag then it text in the paragraph tag would be composed according to the roll so this is how we can specify rules in HTML which is beyond the definition of you can say the default definition of HTML okay there is something called inline styles which you can define as part of the HTML document as this example shows this is a header in the begin header using this style attribute you can specify color : blue so this heading will be appearing in blue similarly for paragraph you can specify by style again the exact font in which you you want this paragraph to appear so it will appear like this since this is part of the same document same file you call it inline the embedded style sheets are also possible embedded styles in means you have a begin style n style tag so you give some name or some type to this style this is a text cascaded style sheet type and this is a special marker this is the beginning and this is the ending and within this you can define all these Styles you want to define the advantage of this style of definition is that all the definitions you can put in one place not only in one place you can even store it in some other file you can import that file from a main HTML file okay so after this when you have the main file you can use those those h2 those P this tags as part of your document and external stylesheet as I said this is exactly what I told you that we can define all these Styles together and store it somewhere else in some other file this is external stylesheet you collect all the styles in a separate document and you create links to the document there is a link tag using which you can link a style sheet so you can specify in which file this stylesheet is mentioned of course type is text CSS these are some optional parameters you can give but this is how we can specify give it at the beginning so after that you can give the your Romans your HTML document and description after that so we have been just given a brief introduction to cascaded style sheets if you look into the literature into the books you'll find that there are many other different ways and options there but the idea is same that you want a method to expand the capabilities of HTML to expand the way that that information gets displayed on the screen of the browser problem now as a user you can define that as a web designer you can define that okay there can be several style definitions in hierarchy say for the whole document there can be one style definition for a particular paragraph there can be a style definition there will be some overruling methods so this is sometimes called cascading there are several rules and then one of them can override the order that is why the name CSS or cascading style sheet comes from actually they are style sheets with some cascading rules that means you can have number of them you can use them in any particular order there are some overriding rules which will take priority over the other okay so with this we come to the end of today's lecture now let us have a quick look at the solutions to the questions were posed in our last class what are the tags used for unnumbered lists well this is e ul and Li list item you have to specify tax for ordered lists Oh L and Li how can we change the bullet style in unnumbered list bullet style there are there is an attribute you can use an attribute there are three possibilities you can have a disk circle or square you can change the bullet style to one of these three and this can be associated with either ul or the Li tags so hyperlink definition that provides link to PDF file and a JPEG image yes you give a the nature F just a PDF file that is all followed by some texts which will be hyperlinked and for JPEG image it will be same only there is only this will refer to a JPEG file next question can relative URL be used to provide link to a different website no relative URL is used only when referring to the same website that is why relative addressing is possible so when you are referring to document on some other web server the name of the server must also be mentioned which means you need absolute URL otherwise how will you tell that that which server you are wanting to refer to you need to give the entire path okay how can you provide a hyperlink to a section in the same document well this is firstly you have to define a name to a section say tennis and you can provide a link by giving this hash hash followed by this name these are called the anchor points in a document you can define anchor points and you can refer anchor points in the in the a tag so that it points to a particular paragraph or a region of this same document how can you provide a hyperlink to a section and document located on some other web server provide a link to the name section using absolute URL here also you can use this kind of hash notation but you have to use absolute URL not relative URL as in the previous example okay otherwise it is same the anchor definition will be there in the other page but here we are simply giving the name hash tennis so when the new page comes on the screen you will see that something is coming starting from that definition tennis onwards okay what do the height and width attributes in IMG tag specify they specify the height and width of the image in the browser window of course most of the modern browsers can resize the image also using these values or overriding this values how can you provide an image hyperlink using the this IMG tag within a ok this is how we can provide now the questions for today's lecture what are the HTML tags associated with table definitions so all the tags that we had talked about in connection the table that has to be mentioned how do you specify table entries spanning multiple columns okay this I have discussed what is the purpose of the frameset tag well you should distinguish that what is frame set what is frame what is the distinction between these two and that means how they are related so basically this question is what is the purpose of the frame set tank fourth question what is the purpose of the no frames tag this also I have mentioned five what does this asterisk or star signify when specifying the width and/or height of a frame this also were illustrated with the help of some examples what does percentage signify when specifying the width height of a frame again this also we had given an example what is inline style for specifying style sheets give an example what is external style for specifying style sheets so in this lecture we had talked about some aspects of HTML now HTML is not the end of the story there are some other technologies which have developed which has come up subsequently to supply HTML to replace HTML to be a technology of the future you can say and one such language is a language called XML or extensible markup language now in our next lecture we shall be talking about XML we shall see its similarities to HTML and the ways in which it also differs from HTML and you shall see how we can use XML not only for creating web pages but for other applications thank you I will come back we have been talking about the issue of design of web pages we have talked about HTML in the last few lectures and we also talked about that there are some other technologies which have come up subsequently this hTML is not the only way in which you can go ahead in time there are other more powerful and more flexible solutions and languages which has come up in today's lecture we shall be taking up one such language for the purpose of discussion and this is extensive extensible markup language which is more commonly known by its acronym XML so first let us try to understand what is XML see we have seen HTML earlier hTML is a language using which you can create the web pages it is a markup language markup language means we specify the textual content of the document as well as we specify how the textual content should be structured or should be viewed on the screen the concept of the tags and attributes come from there so this is what a markup language is now XML like HTML is also a markup language so here lies per similarity let us see so XML is also a markup language well although here we are we are talking about creating documents we shall see later that x7 has be used not only for creating document but for many other application as well there is some structure information that we can capture through tags like HTML markup language as you know these are the markup language use of tags is a mechanism to identify structure for example a begin paragraph and in paragraph tag will tell you that well this is a paragraph in the document begin h1 n h1 will tell you that this is a heading in the document so these are structural information which you can extract so structure information will contain content which can be text which can be other form of information also image and also it should contain indication of what role the content plays for example I gave you some examples heading paragraph address but one problem with HTML is that this set of tag is limited by the definition of HTML if for example I want to define a new tab for country for City I do not have it but in XML we can do it we can define our own tax we shall see it later so if you compare now XML and HTML you are likely to encounter in the document this XML elements are like tags so XML elements they are the most important form of markup or the way of specifying some sections of the document or text whatever you are correcting you are doing or writing now XML elements when you are using they must contain a start tag and a matching end tag just like HTML you can say that in HTML the elements are predefined and we you are calling them tags so begin tap-in tag there ways of doing end tag starts the slash with the same name so here also that syntax remains the same a small example an element we are calling it City end element slash City in between some text well this text can be arbitrary but in the context of a context our XML we understand that this character is the name of a city so an application which is reading the data will understand that this correct poor is part of an element called City so the application understand that this is the name of a city okay so semantic is also captured here very nicely and as I mentioned in the example that if you have empty elements you can write them by putting a slash after the name of the element well here alternatively you can also use both the tags without any content in between blank and one thing to notice that unlike HTML XML is case sensitive so when you are defining an element C T lowercase C iti and capital C ity are not the same you must follow the same case convention when you are using XML or even just using XML for some other applications there is a naming convention for the element that means when you define for example I have given the name city so how you can define names there are some simple rules the rule says that the name must begin with an underscore or a letter yet M is a character I chose it but within the name you can have any number of letters digits underscores - and dots or periods so any combination of this will constitute the name of an element so so the element you can construct using any combination of these [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
