so what we've done so far is we've added a video and inside of the video element we added some source source elements that are actually telling where our videos live when we preview this in the browser it's really not much to work with right because it just embeds the video but it doesn't actually allow us any kind of controls to play it I feel like something's missing and that missing element is attributes on the video tagged I could kind of add some extra stuff that will need the first thing you could do is just google video attributes html5 video attributes and you should see these optional attributes over here I'm looking at the w3c's page right here and it lists some of the I think all of the actual attributes that you could use on it so probably the first one that will want to add is controls because currently we don't have any way to stop and start our movies and we could add controls as easy as right after the video we just space add controls as part of the attribute and then if you refresh it look at that I went from having no control to having a control now notice that I'm looking at this in chrome and this is Chrome's player because they all look a little different in each browser when i refresh it like that here's a different looking player we have safaris like the QuickTime looking player and then if we go to Firefox we have yet another one now if you wanted if you wanted the player to look consistent over all browsers you have a couple choices I mean fundamentally this is all a HTML CSS and JavaScript that's creating this dis control so you could look into creating your very own customized controls there's plenty of tutorials out there or you could just find an html5 player and they'll have you know Jas videos one of them I mean there's there's a lot of examples out there that's just a JavaScript that you add to your page and it create and it uses a different player and it will all be the same now again you could make them all the same if you took the time to make your own custom player which in some situations you may want to I mean if you're a big website that's a puppet if you were YouTube clearly you're making your own video video player but for what we're doing now and just start now I think using the individual players of the individual browser players is just fine looking at some of the other elements that we have just to look them over we have autoplay you know sometimes people do this where they autoplay music when you get to a website or autoplay a video that's just lame I'm just telling you if if you're thinking it's a good idea on your site I just I'm dying to reconsider because it's just highly annoying to people especially if you know a lot of people put like music on their homepage that automatically plays so if I'm searching through your website every time I move back and forth from that page that audio is going to restart and restart and restart I mean you want to shoot myself in the head when I had that kind of stuff or or just press the mute button it's telling it's not doing your visitors any favors auto playing this stuff although autoplay is appropriate if you have maybe you put a link on your page that executes like a so you have a text link that when you click on it it does one of those overlay businesses that'll have the video overlay on the page well you've already clicked on it once and the you visitor assumption is that it's going to start playing and that may be an appropriate time to use autoplay if you're embedding a different HTML page or if you want to use autoplay for sure on your page you may want to use it with the mute button at to sit with the muted attribute now I've seen a lot of advertisements do this you know it's like you go to a page and you're just looking at something some kind of text on the page but then you also see some motion happening on the page as well that kind of distracts you but not with the audio I think YouTube we do tues main page is a good example of this that's better right you auto start a movie but you auto start it muted so it's not very intrusive okay that's cool another one preload you can actually preload the video and another you well to say we use source we have width and height but i'm not going to define a width and height of mine just yet you know I try to err on the side of less code as opposed to more when I'm writing oh and I'm writing stuff so I'm going to stay away from that unless I need it and there actually is a specific need for it later and the other pretty good attribute that I'm going to use next is poster right now when we refresh it there's just a black screen so that's kind of lame and I want to actually have something that looks good so poster allows me to overlay an image over the video when the video is not playing so let me go space invaders the trick to using a poster for your videos is that you want the dimensions of the picture that you have to be the same as a the video so just keep that in mind there's some CSS and some HTML that we could work with but I think you want to kind of get into be about the same size so just to show you real quick how this works I'm just going to copy and paste this URL it's not really what I'm going for but poster equal lips let's see let me use there we go actually I won't do that i'll just copy and paste that URL and now let's just see poster in action huh did I not hmm let's see I did something wrong over oh yeah I see what I did wrong I didn't actually add there we go all right there we are you see now here's poster and when I click it it kind of gets big so I don't clearly don't want that functionality I'd prefer to have it be the same size so it just automatically goes to it but that should give you an idea of how to use some of the attributes that the video element has to offer
