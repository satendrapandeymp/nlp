hello everybody this is Adam from the Philip PHP comm here and I was over at web intersect visiting and I saw that somebody wrote in his name is little orange he wrote in how to make remaining characters box like a one on this platform and the home page so every time you enter character it changes from 250 remaining to whatever remaining so I wrote in I'll make a little tutorial for you Spongebob Squarepants and he said thanks with little smiley so you see when I open the blab forum here and I'm typing in you see the remaining character count it lets me know how many away from 0 I am the way I know how many characters I can still type into the forum this may be some times where you're limiting characters you don't want any more than 250 see if I take that and I try to put in more than 250 see when it gets down to 0 it just won't take anymore no more than 250 all right let's say this is your current page and forum now yours would have a lot more information in it - just slimmed down for simplicity but this is a form tag this is a text area use your HTML tags body tags and your head tags right there the first thing we have to do is give this text area an on key down listener and on key up listener so when a key goes down or up in this text area while somebody's typing or whatever we're going to fire off some events now to be able to do that we have to put an on key down event and on key up event so I'm going to pop that in right here so there you have on key down and on key up now with in on key down we're going to call the JavaScript function which we haven't created yet we're going to do that in just a second and that's going to be up in the head tag but we're going to call the JavaScript function there called text counter it's going to be fed two parameters the first parameter is going to be this form ta which is this text area you see the second parameter is going to be this form dot count display which we're going to create that little field in just a second the count display is going to be that little tiny box that holds how many characters are left that they can type in remaining now you can see in the on key event that we're doing the same exact thing targeting the text counter function in JavaScript saying this top form ta is the first parameter this top form that count displays the second parameter exactly like the on key down event now here after the text area closes you can just put a line break or a break tag rather however many as you need there and you put another input field which is going to be a read-only the type is text the name is count display remember we're sending that name to the function that way the JavaScript function knows what field to target to put the remaining characters count into as people type you can make it any size and length you need and its initial value you want to make whatever your maximum is mine is 250 go to design view you'll see something like that there's your little box there's your text area okay let's change what this says to JavaScript enable text area for limiting and Counting characters because once we put the JavaScript function in that's what it's going to do so now at this point all you have to do in your form is change your text area to have this on key down and on key up events and then you just add this little text field display for the count display make sure it's read-only that way they can't type in it and fiddle with it all right now let's go on to the head tag of the document on the web page you go right into the head tag you put in this script which is JavaScript it's not jQuery just raw JavaScript and it's not Java I see some people on my site they say Java when they mean JavaScript so I just wanted to point out that Java and JavaScript are two totally different beasts so the first thing we do inside of the script tag is we claim a variable called max amount and that's equal to a number 250 you can make that whatever number you want you just have to change it here as well next thing within the script tags is a function and this function is called text counter and that's the one that fires off every time the on key down and on key up events execute and you can see each time that it fires off down here we're sending it to parameters remember the text area and this yield here so both of those fields are known by the JavaScript function so here we're sending it to parameters and here we're sending it to parameters those two parameters are picked up right here in this function and then you can name them whatever you want I just named a text field and show count field so it made good sense but this could be X and this could be Y you just have to make sure in your function everywhere is where it says text field change that to an X as well see what I'm saying so they can be named whatever you want when you scoop them up here so you scoop up the two parameters that the text area is sending right when the text counter function is being defined as you can see the function opens here and it closes here with this little closing bracket so inside the function this happens it's an if and else conditional statement it helps you evaluate things okay so this if statement is saying if the text field which is the text area if its value length is greater than our max amount which is 250 so basically you can access the properties of that text field by using the dot so you're gathering the value dot length so text field dot value dot length is going to give you a number basically that shows you how much how many characters are in that field at that very moment and if it's greater than the max amount you execute this code if it's not greater than 250 you execute this code so the code that gets executed here if the field length is greater than the max amount declare the field what property you want to manipulate which is the value of that field and you put this into it which is text field dot value dot substring and there's two parameters that you're feeding to the substring function is zero and max amount so basically what it does just cuts everything off that's more than 250 else you put into the show count field the new value for what the max amount is minus the text field current values length so in my text field I might have 50 characters so it's saying - 50 - 50 and that's the value that your little show count filled that little tiny box at the bottom is going to get because they haven't reached a 250 limit yet so you want to keep updating that little box until they get to 250 and that's it it's very very simple and I checked it in Firefox Internet Explorer and Chrome all the other browsers can some minutes okay hold that one proves helpful to you have fun putting it into your file
