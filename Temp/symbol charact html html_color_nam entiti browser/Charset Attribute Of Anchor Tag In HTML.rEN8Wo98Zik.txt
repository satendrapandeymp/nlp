hi guys in this tutorial we'll understand the care set attribute of anchor tag so let's get started well care set attribute specifies the character set of the link to document let's first understand what's character set all character encoding when files are stored in computer or transferred from one computer to another in binary form that is in zeroes and ones various encoding systems are used to convert a file into binary like Oscar utf-8 and Sai etc different encoding systems have different character sets which is nothing but a collection of fixed symbols or characters here are some of the commonly used encoding systems each of them have different character set and use different ways to store characters for example you can see as tie has 128 characters in its character set and uses 7 bits to store the characters while Anza has 256 characters and uses 8 bits to store a character why is this Cassatt information important let's say I sang these bits from the server to decline if the client does not know the care set of the file it will not be able to understand what the stream of bits means so it will show some garbage information now let's see what happens when I provide the care set information now I'll send the same information but this time I also provide the care set information of the file to the client now since the client knows the cache set of the file it can decode the file easily since it no in asking the given sequence of bits means the character a commonly used HTML care sets HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01 uses iso-8859 one as the default encoding system while html5 uses utf-8 as the default encoding system let's see an example showing the use of care set attribute here in this example you can see I have assigned care set as utf-8 for my file project dot HTML thank you guys for watching this video if you liked this video do not forget to subscribe I will keep uploading more videos on HTML bye
