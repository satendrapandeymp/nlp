welcome to the very first HTML tutorial in this HTML series today we're going to talk about the very fundamentals the basics of HTML HTML is the cornerstone of web development without HTML you literally won't have a web page I managed because HTML stands for hypertext markup language it is the language that marks up a web page so when a browser loads a page it reads the markup in HTML and decides how the page is to be constructed in fact it doesn't make a decision it actually just reads that and that is pretty much the blueprint of how a web page is to be displayed so in the market you can designate certain what they call tags to define structural elements how and a layout of a web page as well as its content so for example you could have headings you have paragraphs now they hate the hypertext part of it is the fact that you can link documents HTML documents together and you use something called a hyper hyperlink sorry a hyperlink so you would create an what's called an a tag and that a tag will allow you to create a clickable link from one hypertext markup language document to another and vice versa and so forth so it is is essentially a blueprint ok it is how the web page is constructed and essentially you know strictly speaking it's not actually a programming language especially in the same sense as something like Python or PHP or JavaScript because it is just a way of of laying out the page there's no there's no control flows here there's no if statements there's no switch statements it's not object orientated at all it is quite literally just now the webpage is to be displayed how it's to be rendered how the browser interprets it as a webpage but like I said it's the cornerstone of web development I haven't done a HTML to set of tutorials yet so so here we go I mean this is this this is one of many tutorials that I'm going to be doing in this series today though we're going to focus on the fundamentals the very basics of HTML how we can actually start constructing HTML correct narrow web pages but before I get into that I just want to mention something just going through my notes here and I just want to talk about background HTML so HTML was first conceived in late 1990 91 by Sir Tim berners-lee in around that time there was but in version 2.0 came up our version 2.0 I'm going to say version 2.0 because HTML itself is a specification ok and that specification is decided by a group of people or organization called the w3c okay this organization writes this this guideline this this this you want me you can look it up them on the net just go to w3c the org and it lays out how HTML should be used and the reason why we have this organization is that you know you don't want to have certain browsers going off and doing their own thing you don't want the browser certain browsers to go off and say you know I'm going to display my my paragraphs in a completely different way to to another browser you need to have some level of consistency some consistent yes some consistency throughout the board and therefore we have w3c so for every iteration of the versioning the browsers get together with the board and they decide on Rhian on certain specifications and then certain browsers adopt you know the the the versions or the types of specifications within the version and then as the later versions of those browsers come out more things get accepted as they're very written into the browsers and so forth so like I said back in the 1990s we had version 2 then in 1995 we have versions for now we're on version 5 which came out in I think it was nineteen three it was throughout of 2012 that does sound like a long time ago but that but html5 is is kind of like a de-facto now I'm not going to talk anymore about previous versions of HTML and there's really no point because what's the point in talking about a technology that is no longer used because you know all the one day rousers now support html5 okay so let's actually start writing some code shall we so on the right-hand side here we have a browser which is Safari and on the left-hand side we have a text editor and this text editor in that I'm using is NetBeans but you can use whatever you want you could use notepad for example just ensure that the file ends with an extension of HTML okay so the first thing that we need to do is tell the browser what version of HTML that we're using and we use something called a doc type a document type to do so now in the previous versions of HTML you do this in a completely different way so if for any crazy reason we're still using earlier version of HTML so it takes to run for for example then do research google that and find out how you do it I'm only focusing on html5 here and I will be throughout the Prius throughout this tutorial series so we do this by creating eight duck type which is done like so doctype HTML and that basically means that it is going to be a haich-d ml5 document now in this document we need to define certain tags and the tags are what create the page they're what the browser uses to decide or to read and then render the page out and within these tags you have the content so for example when you're creating a paragraph you would have a P tag at the start as well as at the end of the paragraph and the browser's know that that is a paragraph tag that markup is is that marks up the paragraph tag but we need to first open the HTML tag and we do this like so and we need to close the HTML tag like that now opening is literally these greater than less than symbols and then the tag name and then closing them is again the greater and less than symbols but with this forward slash of a start so that's the start of the HTML document and that's the end of the HTML document so anything under here is not HTML okay so the next thing we need to do is actually open up what's called the body now the body is 3 is what is displayed on the page okay so we have a body there's also a head tag but I'll get into that in in a different video perhaps another tutorial we're only worried about the body at the moment now what the body tag is a very first HTML tag but you can actually see in a in a in a web inspector all right the second tag I should say because you can see the HTML but you can actually stylize a HTML tag sorry that the body tag and anything within that is well so let's say we want to create a heading and we do h1 h1 like so so we're opening closing that and we're just going to do this is a test and we're going to save that I'm going to go to the browser and my project mouse and refresh this page and we can see that we have this is a test now why do I use a h1 what does h1 actually mean well h1 is that stands for heading H stands for heading and one means that it's the first heading ok it doesn't mean that you can't have any more h1 tags you can certainly do that let's have let's do this again so underneath we're going to have this as a test and this is a test again save that refresh this and we can see that we have two h1 tags here but the dick the difference really between the different headings is that the your you're saying to the browser that this heading has more has more priority perhaps than the other headings so when I say other headings you can actually have quite a few so if I did hey CH and then we can see two three four five and six and you can go on further than that and essentially h1 has more priority than h2 and that has more priority than h3 and so forth and what I mean by priority it's essentially the visually stylistically it has the h1 has is bigger than h2 tag h2 time is bigger than h3 time and so forth but it also has different meanings for things like SEO search engine optimization where h1 is seen as a tag which has more an 82 tag so for example you could create a blog post in WordPress right where the template of the blog post has a h1 tag and the h1 tag is used to it as the title of the of the blog article right whereas the h2 tag could be used for something completely different it could be used as a way of subheading that article so for example we could do something like this h2 and I'm actually going to give this a little bit more meaning so so this is a test we're going to do article title and in here we're going to do author name and we're just going to remove that and if I was to whoops we even closed that off save that and then refresh here we will be able to see that we now have can you see the difference in style we have apart from not being able to spell article there we go there we are so we have article title as the first heading and then the second heading here which is author name and we could do like so to give it a little bit more okay so if this was let's do HTML tutorial one and then we can create a haitch Tube heading which is just the basics there we go so we have the heading HTML tutorial 1 and then the subtitle the basics now after this we want actually want to create some some paragraphs and we do that using the P tags so we do a P tag and then we close that off and I'm just going to do this tutorial I know talks about the basics of HTML save and can you see that we have a completely different style now because this is a paragraph and we can create several paragraphs if we want to - so we can copy that and paste that in and we have another one down here but we're just going to remove that for now another thing that I wish to show you is something cool but well it's bullet-pointed list okay and there are a couple of bullet pointed lists we'll get into some further down the line but the simplest one is the the unordered list so these are called ul and our eyes and basically a ul is a way of defining that you're going to have a list and then each list item is then within an li list item ul unordered list Li list item so we can do this tutorial talks about basics of HTML and covers and within a P tag we're going to have or sorting the P tag which we can have ul close ul but within the UL we're going to have a series of allies so here we're going to have what HTML means li how to create a a web page and then the second one I'm going to do the basics of our markup and save that now if we were to refresh the page here we will be able to see a bullet-pointed list like so so this tutorial talks about the basics of HTML and covers and then these three bullet pointed lists and these three bullet pointed lists comes from the Allies bits here and it's in an unordered list the unordered list basically means that it's bullet pointed if we were to change this to be something else as so for example if it was an ordered list and three guesses fought for the sort of what the tag is for ordered list if unordered list is ul ordered list is oh hell and save that and refresh the page we can see that we have one two and three now we didn't actually type one two and three we didn't actually go one and so forth and if I just refresh the page we'll have won that one just remove that it's because the browser knows that this is an ordered list and so every list item in here needs to be incremented let's save that and put that back I'm actually going to remove change that back to an ordered list now notice my browser it breaks here if I was to save that you've got a ul and you're closing it with oh well if I was to refresh it does change it back to an unordered list but notice that it is broken so we do need to fix that can have detrimental effects to other mark up alongside it so we need to change that now as you can imagine the HTML files can get quite lengthy and what tends to happen is you would create a series of HTML templates and perhaps you framework of choice maybe if it's no Symphony or or laravel or just you know smart FTP or anything like that so as sort of smartly FTP will be able to construct snippets of HTML that you can use like templates we won't get into that at the moment this is basically a very raw fundamental example of how we can construct our very first web page using markup language if you've got any questions then please leave them in the comment section below do follow me on twitter my twitter handle is p FWD if you've got any questions I've said put them in the comment section below thanks again and I will see you again next time thank you
