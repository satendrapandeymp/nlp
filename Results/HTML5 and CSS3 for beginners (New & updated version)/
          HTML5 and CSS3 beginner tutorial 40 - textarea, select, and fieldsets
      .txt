hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 40 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at more elements that go within a forum and there's definitely a few more elements that I want to show you guys these are not input elements they're actually just other elements that go in a form so they don't have a tag called input right but they do have other tags and yeah if we take a look at this right now you can see that I've cleared out the code in my form and yeah we have just a blank submit or we have a blank website with a submit button so let's go ahead and add in a few elements within this form now the first one I want to show you guys is something called a field set so go ahead and just type in field set and if you save this and run that in the browser you just kind of get like a very big blank box and basically what happens is or basically what this field set is for is to place other elements inside of it and you can also place a legend within that field set so just to give this a little bit more spacing let me add a break tag and then let's add a legend here so legend is another useful tag that always goes within field set because the legend and the field set kind of go hand-in-hand this creates a caption for the fields it so let's type in something like personal data save this jump back of the browser refresh and now you can see that our legend appears in the top of our field set so this is nice for if you have a bunch of different sections within your form so one can be personal data and you can have another section for you know like work data or family data or something like that and yeah basically just divide the form up into a bunch of different sections that is what field sets are for all right but let's just work with one for now and now because we have this field tent let's go ahead and put in a few other elements so obviously we can work with our input of type text and ask the user for the name now we already know what this is going to look like so I'm not going to bother refreshing just yet but maybe let's also add in a label okay because you guys need to know how to use labels or where your labels are useful which kind of we've already worked with but let's refresh that and so we have a place for user to enter in their name all right we also might ask them for the email address and so on and all these other input elements that we have already looked at but I want to try and hit all the tags that we haven't looked at yet so one of those is a select box so let's just add in a couple break tags over here break and a break I'm just doing this for spacing reasons so that it doesn't all appear on one line and now let's go ahead and type in select and if you type in select just like this and leave a blank you kind of don't end up with anything but what a select box does is give us a little drop-down list that we can then select items from so right now a blank select kind of just gives you this blank box which is very useless so let's go ahead and give it a few options so you basically place all these option tags within the select box and then that gives you options then you can actually select from that box so let's say we're asking the user for their career so let's just grab a label here so we know what this is for so basically what is your professional or something like that and then they can fill in a software engineer or give another option here social media manager and let's give it a third option as well something else that they could select that is a job brand manager something that okay cool so let's come back over the browser refresh and now you can see that we have this drop-down list with a bunch of professions that the user can choose so that's how you create a select box in HTML right there also our or there's one other element that I definitely want to show you guys which is a text area so let's add in a couple break tags over here again break and break and then add in a text area right so a text area allows the user to fill in a lot of information basically it's not the small input types but you actually get like a place where you can find paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs of info so I just want to show you guys a few other attributes that you can put in here because right now you'll see that when you load the page this box this text area kind of is very small you do have any option to resize it but it is quite small so let's let's add some coals so let's say 50 now calls stands for columns and that just determines how wide your text area is going to be so remember early on it was kind of like quite small but now at 50 it's it's much much bigger and you can make that like 80 or something and make it even bigger all right then you can also add rows so because we've got the Coles attribute we can also add rows and I'm just going to sit ten rows over here and watch what happens when I hit refresh we now have a much bigger space or yeah it's a lot higher or taller than it used to be right then you could go ahead and add in some of your own sex here but I would prefer to use a placeholder so it's got placeholder and let's say tell us about yourself all right save this jump back out of the browser and refresh and now you have a placeholder within the text area and you can type whatever and when you start typing this tell us about yourself placeholder disappears right so those are some of the other elements that go within a form and that's how you use them feel free to go ahead and create a whole bunch of forms now with the names professions whatever drop down this text areas and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I sent you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys
