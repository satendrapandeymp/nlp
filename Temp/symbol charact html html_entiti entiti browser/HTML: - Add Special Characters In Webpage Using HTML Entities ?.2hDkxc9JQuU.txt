hello guys you are watching technical bench youtube channel and I am Kunal in this video you can learn about HTML entity so let's start what is HTML entities so HTML entity basically a code that represent a special character in your web page so you can represent testable entity in two ways either as entity name or entity numbers you can reuse an entity name by m % then entity name and represent entity number by am percent then hash symbols then entity numbers suppose we add a copyright symbol in this web page so outward copyright symbol in this web page by using entity main press m % then write copy then semicolon and we can also add covert symbol by entity number by ampersand hash symbol and 169 and semicolon if we save this file and open this file we can see copyright symbol is inserted in a web page one thing note here is that the entity name is case sensitive so be aware of tag let us take one another example suppose you demonstrate how to use paragraph tag in HTML when you write this left angle bracket then your browser treated it as or tag note as a special character so we write paragraph tag so when we save this file and open this file you can see the browser treated this as a tag node as a special character so so for represent a left angle bracket in your webpage use their corrective entity so you can represent left angle bracket by m % and p and semicolon and for the right angle bracket juice and percent then GT and semicolon and you can also replace this with entity number also this file and open this file now you can see the browser treated it as a plain text rather than the tag so these are some important edge table character entities I hope you understand what is HTML entity if you like this video click on the like button and if you have any query write in the comment and don't forward to subscribe this channel thank you very much
