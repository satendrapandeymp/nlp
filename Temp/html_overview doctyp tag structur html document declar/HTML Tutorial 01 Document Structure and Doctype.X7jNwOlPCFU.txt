HTML stands for hypertext markup language it's the predominant markup language for web pages and it provides a means to create structured documents for text such as headings paragraphs lists links and more and you can also embed images and objects and it can be used to create interactive forms HTML can also be used to include the CSS cascading style sheets to define the appearance and layout of texts and other material and that's when it really becomes interesting but before we get that far we need to learn some basics so let's start by opening notepad and the first thing you are going to write is the following according to HTML standards each HTML document requires a document type declaration which we call the doctype and the duck type begins the HTML document and tells a validator which version of HTML to use in checking the documents syntax and there are more than one doctype in use but the one we are using is very common and in browsers the function of the doctype is to indicate the rendering mode particularly to avoid quirks mode and quirks mode refers to a technique used by some web browsers for the sake of maintaining backward compatibility with the webpages designed for older browsers w3c stands for the World Wide Web Consortium and is the main international standards organization for the world wide web and DT D stands for a doctype declaration en stands for english and HTML has been around for quite some time and version 401 has been around for nearly 10 years if not longer and if you go in on the source code of different websites you might also see X HTML and html5 now HML 5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites there is still working on making it official and we'll get back to both X HTML and html5 in later tutorials HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags surrounded by angle brackets now when you have a beginning tag you usually also have an ending tag we'll soon see that so let's start the document with the tag HTML now your document is divided into a head and a body section whatever is in your head section doesn't show up in your document whatever you have in your body section does so let's start with the head tag now the head element is a container for all the head elements which can include scripts instruct the browser where you can find style sheets provide maida information and more the only required element in the head section is the title element which defines the title of the document and we're going to call our document for my first HTML document now title is your beginning tag and since we are now finished with our title we're going to go ahead and place our ending tag here the only difference between a beginning tag and an ending tag is that you have a slash right after the first angle bracket and this completes our title and in our case it also completes our head section slash now we're going to start on our body section and we're going to start with a body tag now the body element defines the documents body and it contains all the contents of of your HTML document such as text hyperlinks images tables lists etc for now we're going to write hello world that's going to be our body and since our body section now is complete we're going to end it like this and this concludes our document now there's still one tag which we have to place and that's the ending tag for HTML now one way to do this so you don't forget an ending tag is immediately after writing your your beginning tag you can write your ending tag and it doesn't really matter if there is spaces in between and then you can start your start on your head tag afterwards before we save our document there is one thing I want to show you the untitled here in notepad is soon going to be replaced by my first HTML document and all the tags that we have a placed in our document will be replaced by the words hello world so let's go ahead and save our notepad document file save as now I'm placing my documents in My Documents folder but you place it wherever you feel like placing the document as a name here I'm going to call it for a test one to prove a point and not my first HTML document but the important thing here is the ending we are going to have the ending HTML and notepad has a tendency to have the ending txt on everything so instead of txt type we are just going to click on all files and then we're going to save it now so far we have the test one here but when we close the notepad and bring up our My Documents folder we have the test one and it's a HTML document double-click it and in the top here on Explorer you see my first HTML document which was what we had between our title tags and in our body section here all we have is the words hello world if we want to view our source code code we'll go in on a page source code and this is the code that we wrote for our HTML document now I saved the document as test one which was to prove a point I would advise you to save it as the same as what you write as your title now in these first tutorials we will be using notepad but we will soon try out different editors more suited for our purpose you have editors out there that will highlight the syntax for you add code automatically for you and as you type your code it will give you options it makes it really easy to write code and that's a good thing for now bear with me and write your tags yourself we still have a minute left so I'm going to show you one thing if you go in on your internet and we will go in on the New York Times when we look at their source code we see that they are also using HTML 401
