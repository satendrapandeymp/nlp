in this video we're going to take a look at the Dom the document object model one of the most important things to how to use javascript now the first thing that happens of course is the browser loads your web page and it takes the HTML parses it and then renders it to your web page and we can see HTML right over here the second thing the browser does is it creates the Dom the document object model and it creates all of these objects for our HTML tags every one of these HTML tags has a corresponding object so the HTML tag that has an object over here the div tag that has an object over here the paragraph tag that has an object over here so again it's a two-step process remember the HTML page gets loaded first and then the browser creates the document object model based off the HTML code that was rendered and so it is the Dom that allows us to use our JavaScript code to access parts of the web page so that's how it works now here's the first important point both of these are documents this is an HTML document and this is the Dom the Dom is a document - it's just a different representation of this code but they're the same thing they're both documents in fact the web page that gets loaded the web page that the user sees is a document so they are all actually the same thing they're just different representations and so one is HTML markup code of course one is the document object model that's a document and the actual web page that gets loaded once again is a document and once again they are just different representations but they are the same thing that's the key key point here and so that's what the D stands for the document that's the first part of the document object model now the object is just what I just said every one of these tags has a corresponding object so the head tag has an object and that gets created for us the body has an object that gets created for us that we can use and we know what objects are now right they comprised methods and Bertie's that we can use and we can use those methods and properties to alter every single element in our webpage now you might ask well why do we have to use objects why can't we just directly put our JavaScript in here why do we have to go through this dump why do we need to use the Dom to change an alter our webpage why can't we just put our JavaScript directly in here and the reason for this is that hTML is a markup language it is not code in the way javascript is JavaScript uses objects it doesn't use a markup language that's why we need objects created for each one of these tags over here then our JavaScript can access these elements and use them so that's the main reason we need the document object model that's really the whole reason is that they are two different languages but this document object model acts as an interface that allows us to get to the web page and access each different part of that web page and then go ahead and do whatever it is we want to do to that particular section and so that's really the essence of this object part of the document object model now there's also this final word here model the M and that just represents this tree structure that we have that's what the model stands for and what is this tree structure doing it's the relationship between all of these elements and if you know HTML you probably already do if you're watching this series you know that each HTML element is a parent or child element so for instance the HTML element is the parent of the head and body element and the body element is the parent element of this h1 and these two div elements and so on and so on and of course this h1 element is a child element of the body element so that's also what this model has to do with it's the relationship between these elements and together they all equal the document object model now let's go back to objects for just a minute here now the top of the food chain is the document object this object actually represents the entire webpage the entire web document so we're going to be using this in next video actually when we actually start using the document object and so this is one of the critical objects and so we can use all the methods and properties that are associated with the document object that gets created for us and so again we'll be using that in the next video now we've been talking about HTML tags and how an object is created for each one of those tags but what about some of the other areas in an HTML page specifically the attribute how do we get to that and the actual text how do we get to that how do we reference that and that's where this concept of nodes comes into place and that's what the document object model has it has this concept of nodes and there are actually twelve types of nodes but the good news is we only need to know about three of those the first is the element node and we've been talking about those and actually nodes are a type of object it's just a little bit more specific and so again the first type of node is the element and we've been talking about that the second is the attribute and that's this ID attribute that we have right here there are also class attributes remember you can use a class or ID if you followed my CSS series those are the two types of things you can put in here so there's an attribute and that's the second type and then the third type is actually the text that's a node that's called the text node and actually they correspond in that order one two and three and that's how we actually reference them in our JavaScript code so again that sort of relates to hierarchy so if we take a look at this div section one the element node is the div tag and everything's contained in there right we have the opening tag in the closing tag that represents the element node and then we have the attribute right here that's inside this div tag that's the attribute node and then below that we have another actual element node which is the paragraph node and within that this first fish text is the text node so those are the three main types of nodes but as you can see we can have different types of nodes within the div node and the paragraph is an element node the div is an element node the ID selector is an attribute node and again the text has its own node which is called the text node and we will talk a lot more about nodes in future videos so that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video where we will start to use some of the methods and properties of one of the most important objects in the Dom the document object so you guys
