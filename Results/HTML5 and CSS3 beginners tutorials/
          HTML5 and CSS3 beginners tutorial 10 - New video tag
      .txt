hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 10 and in this video I'm going to talk to you guys about the new video tag in html5 again this tag is new to html5 so there could be some issues regarding browser support okay so some users that are using older browsers might not have support for this video tag so just keep that in mind when using this video tag okay so to add a video tag onto the web page we're obviously just going to put in our two little symbols for our tag and we're going to type in video okay and this is a double tag so we're actually going to close it off as well and in between here I'm going to put in another tag which is a the source tag okay and as you can see this is very much the same as in the previous tutorial when we added some audio to our web page okay so the one thing we have to do now is just in case the user is using an old browser that does not support this video tag we are going to have to leave them a message so if we type a message and over here if the video tag works the user won't see this message but if the video tag doesn't work in other words they have an old browser then the user is going to see this message so let's just say if you can see this you need to update your browser okay okay so now we've got all the tags and this message out the way there are still a few attributes that we have to work with okay so the first one is the source attribute and we actually have to tell HTML what video we plan on using in this video tag okay so I've actually got this video here to mp4 and I suggest you use mp4 because they are probably the most widely supported video type so we're going to just use this little gameplay video so let's go back in type that in Lowell underscore gameplay dot mp4 now I should probably close that off as well there's another attribute which we can use here called type and basically what type has to be set equal to is just what type of video are we using okay we just need to tell the browser what video it should be expecting and it's obviously going to be a video slash mp4 okay because the video is in mp4 so we're just going to say a Firefox listen up expect mp4 okay now there are still a few other attributes that we need to work with okay so we're going to put those up here in the video tag and the first one is going to be the width of what we want the video to display as okay so YouTube actually uses 640 as the width so I'll use 640 on my video as well and for height we can set that equal to 360 so this is just going to make sure that the video is 640 pixels wide and 360 pixels high okay and that's pretty much the same sighs as a normal video on YouTube okay and then we've got one other attribute which we need to work with at the moment and that is the controls attribute without this we wouldn't be able to play our video at all okay so let's go ahead and save this now okay and run this in Firefox and as you can see we've got this video over here and there's a little play button and whatever so we've got some controls here okay if we didn't include this controls attribute so let me go ahead and take this out go back here again click refresh now you can see we don't have any control so we have no way of starting this video so we actually need that controls attribute okay unless we want to make our own controls but then we need to know a little bit of JavaScript first okay so let's go ahead and click refresh and as you can see we've got the controls back so when I click play the video will start playing I know you there okay so that's just me talking while I was playing League of Legends now there are two other attributes that we can use okay so let me go back here and just add those in as well and the first one is going to be autoplay and the next one will be loop okay so what autoplay does is it just means that as soon as the user loads the webpage the video must start playing okay and loop loops the video so as soon as the video gets the end it's going to start at the beginning again and carry on going okay so loop might be kind of annoying for some people because once they finish watching the video they're probably not going to want to watch it again but also play on YouTube if you go to if you click on a video the usually the video always plays automatically so they would then be using an autoplay attribute on their videos okay so let's go back to Firefox now and when I click refresh because we've got to autoplay attributes this video will start playing as soon as the video or as soon as the page has loaded so let me click refresh and as you can see as you can see the video actually played okay now if I fast forward this right to the end and then I'll let it play again then it should start again from the beginning because we have the loop attribute as well okay so as you can see it went from the end right back to the beginning so that's what loop does okay so you don't actually have to use all of these attributes controls I would recommend you use that for now until maybe we learn some JavaScript but for now just always use controls autoplay and loop you don't have to use both of them you can just use one or the other but I just show them to you both to save time okay so thank you very much for watching guys that's all I have for you in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free
