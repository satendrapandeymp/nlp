here we have the directory structure for our learning project that we've been working on for the last four lessons but now it's very quickly becoming messy and we only have a couple files it is considered a best practice to always divide your images your CSS files your JavaScript files which you will learn about eventually into their own folders that way you don't have 30 images within the root it's much harder to navigate it's much less organized so instead create folders for your CSS and for your images now I'm going to take my style and bring it in here any images I have will go in the images folder once you begin working with JavaScript you will place any scripts within this folder and then it's still okay to have dividers for your specific HTML files it just depends if you need that it's perfectly okay to have about that HTML within the root of your project if that's what you want now if we come back to our project we need to update this before we were referencing style that CSS but that will no longer work if I reload the page as you can see like so and that's because we are looking for style that CSS within the root but we should really be looking within the CSS directory so now I'm going to say go into CSS directory and then find a style sheet called style dot CSS reload the page and now all is working fine and we've organized our files much more cleanly so always do this for each new project you may even find that it's smart for you to create a base folder and file structure for all new projects that way you don't have to create these folders and files manually every single time and I highly recommend you do that in the next lesson I'm going to teach you about images
