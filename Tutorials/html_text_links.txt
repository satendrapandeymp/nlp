<header> Use of Base Path </header>
<para> When you link HTML documents related to the same website, it is not required to give a complete URL for every link. You can get rid of it if you use <base> tag in your HTML document header.

<para> Following example makes use of <base> tag to specify base URL and later we can use relative path to all the links instead of giving complete URL for every link. </para>
<para> This will produce the following result, where you can click on the link generated HTML Tutorial to reach to the HTML tutorial. </para>
<para> Now given URL <a href = "/html/index.htm" is being considered as <ahref = "http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm" </para>
