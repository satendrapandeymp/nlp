we're going to pick up right where we left off in the last video we're going to talk about the child selector now the child selector is a close relative of the descendant selector they kind of do the same thing so once again we select an element inside another element we're doing the same thing with the child selector the only difference is that the child selector selects a direct child of the element and we'll talk about that in a few minutes now the other difference is we use a right angle bracket or a greater than sign for the child selector here in the descendant selector we just use the space but you can see here we have a greater than sign and what we're saying is that blockquote which is the parent element so we specify that first here of course we have a class we're saying select the bold element which is a child element of course it's right here it's a child element of the blockquote element and you're probably wondering well wait a minute what's the difference between the descendant selector and the child selector and it'll come together in a few minutes but let's go ahead and change the color to purple and we'll just go ahead and save this let's hit refresh and there you can see it changed to purple down here now let's pull up a diagram here you can see that bold element is a child in this scenario it's a direct child of blockquote here it is not a child because there is a paragraph element in between and that's the difference think about this for a second if we insert a paragraph element here which we'll do in a few seconds the bold element now is a child of the paragraph element it is no longer a direct child of the blockquote so that's why we would not be able to use this selector because B now becomes a descendant now in both these scenarios the bold element and the paragraph elements are descendants of the black quote element but the difference is is it a direct child that's what you want to ask and in this scenario the bold element is a descendant but not a direct child only one level down can you be a direct child so that's the difference so once again just to review really quickly these two elements at this level in the hierarchy are considered a direct child of the blockquote element they are also descendants oh they are considered a direct child and a descendant so you could use the child selector and the descendant selector here it's only when we come down to this bold element in this scenario where we now can only use the descendant selector because it is not a direct child of the black quote element okay and so I'll just minimize this for a second so let's go ahead and we'll insert a paragraph element in here so let's do that and actually let me bring this diagram back so now this is what we have we have this scenario and so now if i refresh this page the purple text should go away so let's do that let's go ahead and save this first we'll hit refresh and there you can see it just takes the browser's default color because again the bold selector is no longer a direct child it is a descendant and I'll show you that so what if we get rid of this angle bracket now this will work because this is a descendant selector and we'll go ahead and save this and refresh and there you can see it will work because yes bold is indeed a descendant and so that's the main difference and it's just a subtle difference but some people get confused by it as usual I hope you found this lecture useful by the way let's switch this back so you have the child selector as an example so we'll switch this back and we'll also get rid of the P here so that the bold element is again a direct child of the blockquote element okay that's going to do it for this lecture
