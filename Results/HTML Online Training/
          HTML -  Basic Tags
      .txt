hi as in the previous videos we have already seen the introduction and how to start the basic implementation of HTML now it's time to get more familiar with the HTML so in this video we are going to discuss few more tags which will make you comfortable with the HTML and apart from that you will also know what different options are available with you in HTML so let's discuss about the basic tags in HTML now so now here I'll start the basic tags with the heading tags so for that here as I said I have 6 level of heading tags starting from h1 which is the biggest in size you can carry on with the remaining ones that is h2 is still at 6 alright so what I'll do I'll just say this is heading 1 alright so let us come to the browser where I have already opened it and as soon as I will refresh you can see this is heading 1 now I can continue with the others all right so we'll do required changes so now as here you can see I have used all the six tags that is from h1 to h6 with the different text so as soon as I will save the document I'll refresh it here you can see the different size of headings are now available over a browser if you want to align them all in this Center what you can do you can just put the center tag so I will put the center from end the beginning and will close at the end so I have actually enclosed all the six headings inside it so all will be aligned Center now like this alright if you want to make it alignment right in coming videos we'll start working with the attributes which will help us out in aligning of by putting more attributes to any tag but for now I'll just only go for the headings as here you can see all the different headings are appearing in the different line but if I'll put the different text for example if I am writing a very basic text a paragraph so for paragraph I will use a P tag and after that I can start writing whatever I want so let me first remove these tags to make the output more clear and inside this I will put a paragraph tag again I'll close it at the end and between that I will write all the text so this is a new paragraph all right you can write as much as you want inside this but now if I want to put the next line in the another line means let's say this is next line so you can see all the things are there in the same line all right but if I want to break the line from here what I can do is I can put the BR tag so basically this BR is a single tag means it is not a pair tag because I don't want to write anything between the opening and closing tags off BR so what I can do is I can actually close it immediately even if you will not close it if you're not going to show you any error but technically whichever tag is open has to be close so here I will make it a no empty tag means non pure tag and I will close it immediately so now when i refresh you can see it has broken the line similarly if you want to put some more spaces between any words for example by default when I'm giving a single space it is showing a single space out here as well but in case if I'll give some space to this some more spaces they will not be reflected all right so for giving the extra spaces what I can do is I can use and ampersand NB SP that will equivalent to the half space so now I'll copy pasted that forgiving multiple spaces and as soon as I come here and refresh you can see there are some spaces between these two words now similarly if I want to put some formatting inside means P formatting in my web page that is not possible by default so dad's for example if I want to draw this particular pattern all right so I want that these asterisks these stars should be displayed over the webpage like this but when I will refresh here you can see all are coming again in a same line because only one space will be shown between these asterisk all right so if I want to display all these things as it is or wherever I want the output that is that should be as it is as you have designed it here I will go for the pre-formatted tag that is this pre tag so whatever formatting you will do inside this whatever you will write in between these tags they will be displayed as it is all right as here you can see now the output and this particular pattern is exactly the same now let's take one more scenario as I have already gone through the heading tag Here I am using the h2 so maybe this is the heading of my page and after that I want to start a paragraph related to this all right so this is paragraph one alright so obviously it will be looking like this now I want to draw a line between the heading and the paragraph to mark it as a separator so for that what I can do I can use the HR tag it will draw the horizontal line in my web page like this alright so if you want to all the size of this particular HR I will do that with the help of the attributes but here I am NOT going to cover the attributes here we are just going through some basic tags so this is the HR tag which will draw the horizontal line in your webpage so these are all some basic tags using which you can start writing some basic HTML in our coming video we are going to cover some more fantastic features of HTML
