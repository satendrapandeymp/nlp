Wow the old people I'm Sean from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson for your first web page alright so you might want to take a deep breath at this point because you need to prepare you're gonna create your very first web page and by the end of this you're going to basically be a hasty mail wizard no joke all right first things first though in the last lesson we talked about tags and we said that pretty much everything in a HTML document is controlled by these tags and we've got different types we've got tags for text tags for images tacks for headings you know the list goes on and on and basically whatever you want to show to the user you've got a tag for it an HTML document or a web page it's just a series of these tags built up on each other and nested within each other so that's where you were up to in a minute so we're gonna take it one step further now we're gonna dive in and we're going to create a web page from scratch okay so for the rest of this course I'm going to be using a text editor called brackets and it's a free one so you can download that too I'll put the link in the video description I'll just show you the website now where you can download it alright so here we are brackets dot IO with a brackets website and this is where you want to go to download the brackets interface now it's an awesome text editor it's free and it's color-coordinated so you can know what everything is and it's got this cool feature called intellisense which is basically like called him so you forget how to do something brackets is there to help you out all right so what you want to do is click this big download button in the middle and you can do these for Windows and Mac so we'll do that I've already downloaded it it should take you to another page nope it downloads it automatically great I've got it twice now you just need it once so once you've downloaded that just run through the installation and I'll see you on the other side in brackets all right here we are in brackets I've opened it up for the first time we've got no files here whatsoever so what we want to do is create our first HTML document and to do that what we want to do is go to file and new and you're gonna get this little thing here on titled five mine says that's because I've done it four times already and this is my fifth time of taking hopefully it's just gonna say untitled one for you so I'm gonna save this straightaway go to file save as and we want to call it index.html and we're using index because it's the first page the index makes sense right and we're giving it the extension dot HTML that's really really important every time you create a HTML document you want to save it dot HTML all right if you don't save it as that then the browser is gonna be like well I don't know what this is what you want me to do with this is it HTML is it a word doc you know save it as HTML every time and the next thing you want to make sure is that it's all files here is the file type and then you click Save and there we go we've got this little index.html in the sidebar so let's get cracking now the first thing we want to do at the top of every HTML page is put the doctype tank and the doctype is one of those things that you're just gonna have to get used to putting in the top of your documents alright when I first started I was like what the hell is this you know they were so convoluted back in the day they had loads of different doc types but it's really simplified these days and basically what a doctype does is it just saves to the browser hey I'm HTML this is the type of my document I want you to render me as HTML alright so you need to make sure you put this at the top of every HTML document and it's dead dead simple you want to open it like any other tank you would do and you put a exclamation mark first of all doctype HTML simple that's all you need to do right next thing so I'm going to quote another author when I go through this and I'm gonna quote James Williamson and he says that a HTML document is very much like a sandwich and that is an awesome analogy a sandwich has got two pieces of bread and a HTML it needs two pieces of bread or rather to tax to open it and close it and these pieces of bread are HTML tags and would you look at that that's another cool feature of brackets you open attack it closes it for you brilliant all right so HTML there your pieces of bread everything in your sandwich or everything in your web page goes between these two tags all right now then your first time that should go at the top is pretty much always a head tag and you want to think of the head tag it's like the the relish or that the mayonnaise that goes on your sandwich it's not the big meaty content but it's the things that make it taste nicer and it's the same for a web page it's the things that tell our browser look I've got this extra information about this web page I don't want you to show it to the user but I'm telling you look this is about my web page so it's the little extras all right and some things that go in the head are some meta tags and they tell you know search engines like google your keywords so see you've got a fish website you want to sell fish and I want to put in my I want to tell Google look your people search for these keywords if people search for salmon or trout I want them to come to my website so what you want to do is you want to put a meta tag in here in this head part and you put your keywords in there other things we can put in are the meta Cassatt and we're going to do that now and basically what this says is I'm using the utf-8 character set of my document and that's pretty much a standard you don't need to know much about it I certainly don't if you want to read about it you're more than welcome to there's plenty of articles out there and would you know it's about this tag it's got a little a slash inside it and that's because it doesn't have a closing tag it's a self-contained tag I've talked about them briefly and I think the first video tutorial in this course where as a head has got two tags opening and closing and we've got the forward slash in the second tag the closing tag this one doesn't have a closing tag so we put the slash just before we close the self-contained tag and that's pretty you know you do that with every self-contained tag so what else goes in the head we can put things like CSS references we can put things like JavaScript references I'm going to talk about the head in the next movie and I'm gonna talk about JavaScript and CSS in separate tutorials also for now we're just going to put another tag in there called the title and the title tag is the thing when you open a web page and at the top of the tab you see the website title that's what this is so let's just call this my first web page all right so we've done the head for now what's next we won the body not the bottom my mistake don't know what the hell about we want the body and the body is like the meat of the sandwich the roast pork the corn if you're vegetarian whenever's on your sandwich and this is in the body whenever is on your web page that you want your users to see this is in the body anything goes alright so what are we gonna put in it we're gonna put in a title and we'll call this my first web page and then I think we'll put a paragraph tag in as well and we'll say yo kids the flat no we won't because that sounds a little strange report yo guys hope you like my website we sell fish and there we go we've done it that is your first website you've got your HTML doctype tag at the top you've got your HTML opening tag and closing tag surrounding the entirety of the HTML document that's your bread you've got your head with all your mayonnaise and everything that you're telling the browser is about your document and then you've got your body you've got your meat of the HTML page your actual content that you want your user to see and that is the HTML document simple as that I mean it can get a lot more complex and we're going to certainly pub this out as the course goes on but for now let's just save this and we're going to view it in a browser another cool thing about brackets you want to right-click by the way I just click ctrl s to save the document if you right click this index file here you say show in Explorer it's going to pop up the Windows Explorer with your index file in it you just want to double click this and because it's a HTML file it had that dot HTML extension on it it's opened up in a browser and there we go guys we've got our first web page and have you been following along with me congratulations you want to give yourself a pat on the back because that is your very first web page alright so just to recap we've gone through the doctype we've gone through the opening HTML tags the head tags and the body tags so we're going to flesh this out a little bit more as we go on and in the next lesson we're going to look at the head tag I'll see you guys
