today we're going to take a look at some of the various ways that we can style our text we'll look at using fonts we'll take a look at using color in letter spacing and size and lots of things like that let's open up our editor and we have the name net Tut's if we load it in the browser as you would expect it displays and the browser defaults so let's begin I'm going to go to style dot CSS and I'm going to target all h1 s on the page and the first thing is to make it easier to read just for our demo we're going to set it really tall to 60 pixels reload and why don't we set it even taller 120 there we are next again just for the demo let's align it on the page like so and we'll then apply some March on top just to get a nice layout so that we can have some fun with this first you already know how to change the fonts by doing font family and here you can see we have lots of options if we want mono space this is a good font choice when embedding code reload and now you can see a mono spaced font is where every single letter is the exact same width select these you can see that that highlighted section is the exact same width each time another option is to use something like Helvetica reload and if the computer has the Helvetica font installed it will use that another option is Arial which is almost identical you probably could barely tell the difference and we've learned that if we do sans-serif the browser will automatically choose a font of that style another option would be to use a generic font like cursive reload and now you're going to get a fancy font and note that it's not a specific font it's not the cursive font it'll simply instruct your browser to use any fonts that's installed on your computer that matches the cursive style now it's important to note that you're not doing print here so just because I bought a really amazing font does not mean I can then use it on my website because remember you're not transmitting fonts with your website if it works on your computer that does not mean it will work on another person's computer now that does not mean can't use custom fonts it just means you can't assume that the person browsing your website is going to have the same fonts installed that you do now we'll come back to that shortly next let's take a look at letter spacing but before we do I'm going to bring this back to sans-serif print designers know that they often tweak the spacing between each letter and we can do that in CSS as well letter spacing now we can set this to a positive or a negative value positive maybe five pixels you can do something huge like so and you can even do a negative value it's quite common and stylish to do negative one which pushes it together ever so slightly remember depending upon the font size you may be able to get away with a little more negative spacing so with an h1 negative five doesn't look that bad however if you did P letter spacing negative five and let's go ahead and add that on like so you'll see that that looks awful of course because the font size is much lower so with the P tag you might even want to keep that to its defaults I'll go ahead and get rid of that and the associated paragraph as well now next we of course can adjust the color of our font so if you'd like to do a grayish color and specify it like so so now we know that we can manipulate the size of our font the family the spacing the color you can even do things like text transform and then if we want to set it to uppercase what this will do is regardless of the text within your markup it is going to render it as all caps even if this letter is lowercase it's still going to be rendered as uppercase alternatively we can change this to lowercase and that's going to do what you would expect that's a nice little effect when you want to adjust the styling of your entire website maybe all headings in the sidebar need to be capital this is a nice way to do it next let's take a look at just a couple fun css3 properties that are just recently becoming available to us in the last year or so we can use a next shadow this is pretty fun now this is a little more complicated it except a few values the first one is going to be the X offset so why don't we do big values 5 pixels the next value will be the Y offset and we're going to push it down so when I say 10 pixels we're pushing a shadow down 10 pixels the third value is going to be how much a blur should there be again I'm going to set that to 10 and the final value is going to be what color let's do an obnoxious color like red if I load the page now you can see this is pretty neat even though it looks bad we've added a shadow with pure CSS up until a couple years ago web designers had to use images anytime they wanted to do something like this so it's really fantastic that we can now do this directly in the browser now of course you would probably want to do a subtler color maybe black or an off black reload and that's looking better but here's a nice technique what if we adjusted this first to 3 remember subtlety is always better reload and now you get a slight glow all around or if you even want to make the blur a little bit sharper and we're going to put the y-axis down to 1 you can get a cleaner look however if we make it really sharp you can get the illusion of an outline so watch what happens if I say tech shadow I'm not going to push it left or right at all so it's going to remain where it is but then I'm going to push it down the y-axis one pixel worth and then I want no blur at all and I'm going to set the color to black now watch what happens can you see that there is a slight glow below the text you'll be able to see this easier if I use a big bright color and now can you see there's a little bit of red underneath and this is subtle but it really adds quite a bit to your layout so for example if I have a body background of a greyish color and then I set a text shadow to our text of white using this technique you can get kind of a glow in the background can't you let's change this color to black and now you can see we have black but a slight outline underneath if you instead want this little glow to be on top you can change the y-axis to negative which means it's going to be pushed up freeload and now it's being displayed like so you can have a lot of fun with this if I set it to 5 pixels reload now you're getting kind of a side glow you can do a lot of things too especially when you can use a comma-separated list of values so what if this time I wanted to do 6 pixels negative 2 pixels no blur and red now we have multiple shadows so we have white and then we're outlining that white and notice I do one more than each because if I did something like 4 and negative 1 it's going to be covered up and you'll barely be able to see it so I'm going to make sure that I outline this white value by putting it 1 pixel more on each side why don't we change this from 1 to 2 anyhow you can have a lot of fun playing with text shadows things like the traditional fire effect that you would create when learning Photoshop you can actually do that within CSS as well simply by applying a long list of text shadows for now I'm going to bring this back to 0 1 pixel zero light again that's x-axis y-axis blur in color now another option that we have for styling our text is the font variant property you can change it to things like small caps where it'll make it will capital but it'll use small caps and if you've used Photoshop before you'll be familiar with this effect other values that you might like to use inherit which will receive the default font variant from its parent most of the time though you would only use font variant if you're going to do small caps now let's take a look at how we can use custom fonts and I'm going to show you the easiest way which is by using the Google font API if we browse to google.com slash web fonts you can see that we have a huge list of fonts now I will warn you they're not always the greatest fonts ever made but you can find some nice stuff in this case let's look at something that's very noticeable that it's a custom font so I'm going to scroll down and let's find something maybe like this this obviously is not a default fonts so I'm going to click quick use and if I scroll down you'll see that it gives us the option of adding a link element to our HTML that links to this font and then you can see to use it it's as simple as creating a font family property and pass and the value copy this next I'm going to paste it in and because we're going to be relying on this font I'm going to place it before my base style sheet now you'll note here type equals text slash CSS this is something that you'll see quite a bit type equals text slash CSS however it's not important it the browser will default to that anyway so it's a little bit redundant you don't need to use it you could remove it here as well and you're going to get the exact same effect all right so now let's use it within our style sheet we can go back and copy this sample right here and replace it and now we're specifying that we're going to use that custom font that we linked to and then we're providing a fallback to cursive I come here and I reload the page sure enough we're using a custom font and we were able to do this in 15 seconds or so now this might sound normal to you but to actual web designers who have been working in the business for a long time this is really amazing before we had to use very complicated techniques whether we were using terrible images or even believe it or not we were using something called sipper at a time and this was flash we would use flash to add custom text it was horrible it was really difficult to get set up the fact that we can do this now is really incredible whether you see it or not all right so that's going to do it for today you've learned quite a bit about typography there's far more to learn but this will certainly get you started
