we're going to pick up right where we left off in the last video now in the last video of course we validated against this first text box the name text box in this video we're going to validate against the address text box as well so both of these text boxes now have to be filled out so I've added another get element by ID right here and I created a box too variable and if we're going to validate against another text box that means we need to add another condition so we'll have multiple conditions and here is the second condition and in order to do that we need to use a logical operator and in this case we're using the or logical operator so you can see I've got two conditions here now the rest of the code that we use from the last video will pretty much stay the same we're not going to alter it so basically we want the same result if the user doesn't at least put at least one character in these two text boxes an alert will inform them to do so and actually I don't think we want this to say this feel this the field marked in red because we're not actually going to use a focus method in this video we'll do that a few videos but not in this one so we'll just say the field cannot be blank that's what we'll say now when you start adding multiple conditions things can get a little bit more confusing and that's why it's helpful to create a diagram and so that's what I've done down here I've created a diagram that will walk us through each of the scenarios and there can only be four outcomes so this is the first condition and that will be condition a and the second condition will be condition B and 0 will be false and one will be true and you can see I've got them listed here so in this scenario the first condition would be true in the second condition would be true and that would make the overall expression true that's because the or operator only needs one of these conditions to be true that's it only one has to be true in order for the entire expression to be true and you can see that here the first one is true the second is false but the overall expression is still true and so that's why it's helpful to write these conditions out to make sure the outcomes are what you expect and of course it's the same as the last video we want this to be true if the user didn't fill out both of these forms true cents yes they filled it out incorrectly and our code gets executed if this overall expression is false that means they filled it out correctly and we won't stop the form from being submitted so let's walk through each one of these now and see how it works okay so in this case the first condition will be true and the second condition will be true so that means both of these are null because that again we did this in the last video we said it's true if this is set to null so no characters will be put into each one of these text boxes so we hit submit and it stopped us good let's go to the second one now the first one will be true so this will be no but the second one is false that means they filled this out correctly they put in some characters and it stopped us write the expression will be true because of the or remember only one has to be true and it's true yes they didn't fill this out completely because the first one was left not so let's go down to the third outcome so the first is false so they put in some characters up here but the second is truth so it remains no so let's go ahead and hit submit and it stopped us okay let's go down to the fourth outcome both are false so this means both of these fields had characters in them if we hit submit ah it let us go through because in both cases they filled out the textbox correctly they put in characters and if you take a look at this now three of these outcomes will be true if there's any truths in here the or operator will be true and it will stop the form from being submitted so there's only one way they can fill this out correctly and that is to have characters in both text boxes and then both of these conditions will be false so I think you can see why it's nice to fill out these diagrams to see how some of these logical operators work and it's very useful again like I said if you want to start adding multiple conditions now you might ask well how could I add a another condition for this phone text box well we're not going to do it in this video but you would simply just make another variable B box 3 you'd get the element ID for that which in this case would be phone right phone and then you would create the third condition here and actually you would use the or operator again so you would put it here and then you would put the third condition right here it would be box 3 value and that's how you can add another condition but you have to use the or operator again okay that's going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
