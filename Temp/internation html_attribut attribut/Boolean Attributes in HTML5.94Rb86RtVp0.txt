okay so we're going to go over boolean attributes so for boolean attributes it means that just the presence of the attribute indicates that a certain option is set and here are some examples checked is used with a checkbox an option button to indicate that you selected that selected is used for options that are selected in a drop-down or select list disabled will disable the input textarea button select option or opt group and a read-only will prevent the user from typing data into a text box password or text area and you can indicate a boolean attribute in a few different ways but we're gonna probably just use this way it's the best so let's see if we look here for the checked attribute you can see the result this one comes pre selected as checked because we did that here so for the selected one here's a drop-down menu and you can see select and then different option elements and then outtie is automatically selected so that's why you see it as the first that's the one that's in the box okay and disabled so here's the form with a disabled input field so right here you can type in the first name but you can't type in the in the second one because it's disabled right here and the last one is read-only so for read-only you have two forms here all right and our two input fields but it won't let you change Norway right here because it's indicated as read-only but you can type here so yeah those are some boolean attributes
