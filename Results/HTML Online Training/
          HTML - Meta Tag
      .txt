hi in this video we will discuss about the meta tags Mary drag is somewhat out of league from all those tags which we have covered so far so basically why this Manor tag is used meta basically stands for metadata metadata means the data about data or the information about the information for example our web page will give you some sort of information but the information about that page will be given by the metadata for example if I am creating a website like tutorials point where I want to put some of the information like why I am creating this particular page using what all keywords you can search this particular page from any search engine like Google so those things will be put in the head section inside the meta tag so lets you specify the metadata that i said the information about the information meta elements can be used to include name value pairs main value pairs means the name of a minute and like key words and the value will be list of all the keywords similarly if you want to put a description so name will be description and value will be the actual description of that particular page so does not have a closing tag because it carries all the information in the attributes so basically this name and value is nothing but the attribute so meta tag name is the attribute then its value and then value is again an attribute then its value I'll show you in the practical don't get confused now so that means the thing is it doesn't have a closing tag because I don't want to write anything between the opening and closing tag off meta data one or more meta tags can be included as I just said like we can put different names like first for the keyword second for the maybe the description and so on so we can have more than one metadata the in fact the physical appearance of the document initially I told you like whatever I will see will see in the output of the browser that will be in the body part but I'm going to put this meta tag inside the head other thing is it is containing the Meritor not any formatting thing so it will not impact the output up to a bit so let's see what all tags are means what our attributes are available including this made a tag and how to write the main tag in the head section of HTML so let's start d practical now so now here in the main attack which I already told you like we will be using this particular tag inside the head section so let's come here in the head and I'll start putting the meta tag inside it so the first tag which I have used and I said we can use multiple meta tag so the first main attack which I have implemented here is for the keywords the keywords is used for the search engine optimisation so that if you want your page to be searched by using any particular keyword which a client will use you can add all the possible keywords out here in this particular content alright since the name of this minitex keywords so here we'll put all those words which can be used for searching a particular page or a Content similarly if you want to give any description about your webpage you can use another mirror tag where you will use the description in the name and then after you can use the content make sure that all these things will not make any change in the output of your webpage because I am using it for the internal purpose for giving some information about the web page so the output of the web page will be as it was so here in the body I have just used the h2 tag so in the body you will only see this heading but no change will be shown when I will put these meta tags similarly let's add another minute tag here in this context now I have used the name revised that means I am putting the information like when this particular page was revised last so here in the content you can see the author means who made the changes that's free tutorials point and they did on which the last revision of this particular page took place and similarly if you want to put the name like who particular member who will author write the content of this particular page then you can use the author name in the meta tag and can put some more details about it so as you can see this main attack is just being used so far for putting the different information about the page that's why we call it made a data all right the main attack because it is containing the information about the webpage now let's add another mirror tag which will give me an different kind of feature here I am not using the name keyword here name attribute here rather I am using the HTTP cumulant alright means HTTP - ich wave attribute so here the name of this is refresh and content is five that means if you want your page to be refreshed after a certain amount of seconds then you can use this refresh ashleighb equivalent within you made a tag so as I mentioned five so right after five seconds it will be refresh means of every five seconds your page will be refreshed so let's see how the paper means if there is any change in the output or not for now so here let me refresh the page alright so we'll have to see after five seconds all right I saw something refresh me just focus right here after every five seconds you will see a blink out there that is nothing but it is actually refreshing the page after the certain amount of seconds all right apart from that if you want to redirect your page after every five seconds or maybe after five seconds like suppose there is a banner page which I have created for my website so before going to actual website I want to show that particular banner for maybe five to ten seconds and then automatically if he the user is not clicking on any of the banner I will redirect him to the actual website so if I want to do something like that I can just add one more attribute here that is the URL all right so right here after the content five then semicolon URL so after five seconds when the Refresh will take place it will actually be redirected to the another web page that is the homepage of tutorials point for me so let's come to the browser and refresh it so let me reference this and maybe after five seconds it will take me to the tutorials point so as we expected it did the thing in the same manner and finally if you want to put the mime type which is used in your web page along with the encoding you can use the again a strip equivalent tag where the content type is text slash HTML and can set which we are using is Unicode transformation format eight bits all right that is utf-8 encoding is there in this particular page so these are all the things which can be done by meta tag in your HTML document
