hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number seven and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to link to another page I'm also going to show you how to link to another page on your site so we'll link to an external page then another page on your own website and then I'm going to show you guys how to link to the exact same page but just make the page scroll down a little bit so I've got my text editor open and right now there is no text in here but let's go ahead and add a link to Google so to do this I'm going to open up something called an a tag which is an anchor tag and then I'm going to hit enter and now you can see I've got my opening uh part of the a tag and I've also got my closing part of the a tag but sublime also gave me this href attribute automatically and that is because whenever you link to another page you need a little bit of extra information in your a tag and that extra information comes in in this href attribute and so what this a href attribute actually does is it tells the browser where you want to link to so right now the href attribute is blank there is no value here but I want to add in a link to Google so what I need to do is actually type Google's address in here so let's type in Google's web address but the thing is it has to be the full web address so you have to type HTTP colon backslash backslash ww-whatever the web site is you want to link to so in my case I only link to google.com and now we have a link that will function but there isn't anything for the user to click on so whatever you want the user to be able to click on to link to Google you need to put that text within the or in between the opening and closing tag so let me type in this is a link to Google Save and go over to the browser refresh and now I have my link let's just zoom in to make that nice and big and clear so now I've got this link to Google and if I click on it hey look at that it takes me to Google right so let me go and hit and hit back and now I'm back on my website and that is how simple it is to link to another website you simply just take whatever text you want to be a link and surrounded in this little a tag and then make sure that your href attribute is set to that website and bam you will link to that website right so now let's take a look at how to link to another page on the exact same website so to do that I'm going to need to make another webpage so right now only got my index.html page which is my home page and I need another one so let's go to sublime file save as and I will just save this as second and this whole second underscore page dot HTML make sure that when you save this page is something that you're not using any spaces for now because spaces are kind of not good so let me hit save and now I have index dot HTML and I have second page dot HTML so let's let's let's just make sure we've got both of these open in sublime and I want my home page to link to my second page and then I want my second page to have a link back to the home page so let's just edit the text here I'm just going to remove the href and I want to put in a heading on the top of the page just so we know which page were on at any given time so this is the second page and then I'll go to my home page and just well let's copy that that header and paste it in here and we'll just let us know that this is the home page by putting the text home page there and then the links I want to remove that and I want to remove okay well let's let's change the text within the link to say this will link to page two and then page two will change the text to say go back home so save that let's go back over to the browser hit refresh and now on the home page I have a heading just to let me know I'm on the home page with the link did I not save that let's just make sure I save it come back here and hit refresh and now the text says this will take me to page two if I click on it right now it's not taking me anywhere so let's take a look at what we need to place within this href so right now because both of our files are in the same directory all I need to do is copy and paste the name of the file I want to link to in this case on a link to page two so let's just copy and paste that and put it over here now if you have spaces in your URL you have two spaces are kind of illegal to be up here in the URL of your web browser so that's why I said please don't name it with spaces because if you named it with a space instead of an underscore then you'd have to replace that space with the text percent 20 of course that's kind of annoying and I don't want to do that that's why I stick to using underscores instead of spaces so let's save this and then let's go over to the second page and just make sure we do the same thing here so the link on the second page that needs to link to the home page so let's just grab the name of the home page and paste that in here so hit save let's go back over to the browser and see if this works right so right now we're on the home page and this link should take us to page two click on that great now we're on the second page and this link should take us back home so let's click on that and hey we're back home so now we can sit here and click and change between pages all we like so that is how to link to another page on your website let's go back home and take a look at how to link to the exact same page but just further down the page so to do that I'm going to work with only my home page instead of the second page let's just close the second page for now and I want to just add in a lot of text so let me create a paragraph and here's a cool little trick if you type and lorem in sublime and then hit tab it will generate a paragraph of lorem ipsum if you don't know what lorem ipsum is this is just text that we use as filler content to make a website full of content if we don't have like words for that that page often we use it if you're trying to make a theme or a website that you want to sell to somebody but you have absolutely no idea what they want to put on their website you fill it up with lorem ipsum alright so now we've got a paragraph with lorem ipsum let's just copy paste that a couple times it doesn't look very neat inside either I should probably not waste time fixing it and making it tidy but at the end of all of these paragraphs I want to create another paragraph and this paragraph is going to be the paragraph we want to link to so let's see this is the text we want to find I'm just going to type that in here and then I want to give this paragraph something called an ID so let's type in the ID and set that equal to I don't know a link to find make sure that you don't use any spaces or anything in here and I'm going to then copy that ID and at the top of the page underneath my heading let's just create another a tag and then this will link to the bottom of the page so let's just say go to bottom and in the href because I want this link to link to the text at the bottom I just need a copy and paste this ID and place that in here along with a hash in front so now that the href is set to hash and the ID of the paragraph I want to find which in this case is at the bottom of the page let me just save all of this go back over to the browser refresh and now I've got my heading and I've got all these paragraphs of lorem ipsum but when I click on this link it should scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the the paragraph that has an ID so let's let's test this out click and bam there we are it took me to the bottom of the page where I can see this link for this to work a little bit more effectively maybe this link shouldn't be all the way at the bottom so let's just copy a few of those paragraphs and paste them there and now I mean this content is really in the middle of nowhere let's come back over to to the browser just hit refresh and now let's hit this link and as you can see it's taken the text all the way to the top of the page the text that we wanted to find so that is how to link within the same page and that is all I have for you in this video so I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things
