hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 20th retold in this course in this tutorial we're gonna check out an example of unordered lists in HTML and this webpage is actually pretty similar to the webpage that we created in the last tutorial for ordered lists and in the body section again on line number seven I have the center tag and the h1 tag and the text example of an ordered list and that closed the h1 tag and the center tag in the said order so you know this is going to be the heading of the page and then I have the UL element on line number ade the opening you are tagging on line number 16 I have the closing ul tag in ul is a short form for unordered lists now another unordered list firstly is a list that doesn't have you know that doesn't follow an observable sequence right so if suppose you're listing things that cannot be arranged in a particular order or you know do not have to be necessarily put into some specific order then you would probably want to use an unordered list like let's say someone asks you okay you know name the continents in the world and you just want to list them and you know you don't have to necessarily mention Asia before Africa or you know Europe before Australia right you could mention them in any order as long as you mention all of them it's fine right so that is you know the application area where you would want to use unordered lists and the rest of the syntax is pretty similar to order lists you have the Li tag and the closing Li tag in between that you have your item so you know let's say I want to mention Asia for so I'll have the opening Li tag and the closing at a tag in between that I'll have Asia and then you know so on and so forth I have Africa America Latin America Europe and Australia and Antarctica and I'll save the file and let's see in Google Chrome and this is how it looks now at the moment I see you know normal disks or you know the conventional traditional bullets being used as you know I voted for the list items if suppose you want to change these to you know square bullets then that's also possible all you have to do is go to your UL element and give a space and type in type and you know this is an attribute that we used with the O L element too that is the ordered list element and you know if you want to use square bullets and you just type in square here as a value to the attribute save the file and if i refresh the page in google chrome I see that the bullets have now been changed to square bullets and if suppose you want to use a hollow circles then that's also possible you type in circle instead of square here and save the file again and go back and refresh the page and there we go we see hollow circles now and if you want to change it back to the default mode you could either set the type to disk and save the file and refresh the browser and you would see what was there originally or you could remove the type attribute completely you know it doesn't have to be there without it also it would show you the default setting which is the same as what you see on the screen right now so anyway this is all I wanted to discuss with you guys in this tutorial I assume the next Dorian which we'll discuss more HTML tags and I hope you guys found this tutorial informative and interesting and you may subscribe to my channel if you have already I'll see you in the next video till then take care
