hello in this video I'm going to talk about using HTML tags and I'm going to point out some ways the tags work that should help you avoid common errors that beginners make when they're first starting to write HTML I'm using the document from Robyn's chapter 4 and it's now got tags added within the content in a previous video we started with the plain text content and we added the basic structure tags that every HTML file needs to have in this case what you're looking at now is the same file with the text itself already marked up for its structure so the first thing that I want to call your attention to is the way tags HTML tags come in pairs not always but usually so most HTML tags and I will isolate this h2 tag they come in a pair where there's an opening tag there's content in between and there's a closing tag that matches the opening tag so in this case what you see is h2 is the opening tag for a second level heading slash h2 is the closing tag for that same heading and what occurs in the middle is the content that is designated as a second level heading the tags have nothing to do with the way the content looks we're going to add that in about two weeks with CSS the tags are meant to designate the structural meaning of the document so in this case you've got a second level heading after you had a first level heading which would be the biggest and most important heading on the page I want you to pay particular attention to the way the slash points okay when you have a closing tag it has to have a slash and the slash has to be a forward slash the one that points toward the upper right there are no back slashes in HTML so make sure you're typing the slash correctly and also make sure that you've got the pair set up with matching tags the opening and the closing a pair of tags and their content are called an element so we would refer to this as an h2 element in our document so opening tag closing tag element now some elements are what are called empty elements and these are the ones that don't have a pair of tags there's only one tag there are several elements empty elements that you're going to be using all the time so one of these is certainly the image tag the image element the image element has no closing tag at all so you're going to get very used to this and I'm going to talk about the contents of this element in just a moment another empty element is the BR element the BR tag makes a break and I will talk about that more in a future video and I'm also going to talk about the way Robins set up her h1 here because as you see her h1 contains text and a br element for a line break and an image element so her h1 contains more than just the heading itself two of the things that contains are empty elements an image element and a br element another completely common empty element which occurs in every single HTML document as the first line is the dock type no closing tag anywhere and another very very common empty element because it also occurs in every HTML document is the meta tag in particular in this case it's the meta charset tag no closing tag it's an empty element so you need to be sure which kind of element you're using so you don't make a mistake and add an unnecessary closing tag at the end of your element that would be wrong and your HTML would be invalid notice too that all HTML tags are lowercase other than the doctype the first one in line 1 everything inside the pointy brackets the tags is lowercase no uppercase so now I want to save this document and I want to show you how it looks in the browser and to do that I'm going to go back to my folder and go inside and there's only two things in it the image that Robin is supplied in chapter 4 and the index dot HTML that I've built so if I double-click this in my finder or in My Documents window it will open in my default web browser which is Chrome as yours should be so it's a very simple page it doesn't have any styles or colors added to it and we're not going to do that in this video but I want you to notice in particular the image at the top and the h1 heading below it black goose Bistro because I'm about to change the way that's set up in the HTML because although the way that Robins did it is perfectly okay you don't need to have the image inside the h1 so I'm going to delete the h1 there move it to here and I'm also gonna delete the BR element so I've rearranged Robyn's HTML slightly so I've got the image element all by itself with nothing surrounding it it's inside the body of course because it needs to be in the browser window and then below that the h1 element so I'm going to save again and reload and you'll notice other than a slight movement upward of the image the layout of this page hasn't changed at all and I wanted to point this out because I think that this is more semantically correct I think that including the image inside the h1 element is really not preferred anymore and I wish Robyn's had fixed that notice that spaces I've got a lot of line spaces here in my document spaces between the elements spaces between the lines they are not going to make any difference to what we see on the page because the structure of the page is determined by the tags not by spaces that you type even if I add a lot of spaces within my h1 element around the words and in between the tags if I save this and reload it in the browser it makes absolutely no difference all those spaces I added do not affect what we see because again what we see is affected by the tags and their contents extra spaces are ignored now one last important point for this video I'm going to talk about attributes and I will first clean this up a bit the image element is the best place to start thinking about attributes because an image element has two required attributes so what is an attribute an attribute has a specific name the first one here is SRC it stands for source the second one is Alt alt so these are two names of attributes source and alt and what is the value of the attribute the value of source is blackboost ping it must be in quotation marks the value of alt is logo also must be in quotation marks so these attributes are part of the image element and they're required if you want to find out whether an element has attributes or not whether they're required or optional what you should do is you should go to Mozilla developer Network mdn this is the absolute place to look up the correct and most current up-to-date information about HTML tags HTML elements HTML attributes so if you look on the left hand side you'll see that every tag in HTML is listed in alphabetical order and if we go down to image IMG and we click it we learn everything there is to know about the image element everything about its attributes what attributes are possible there are many possible attributes in addition to the required ones I want to point out that attributes are not arbitrary so other tags other than IMG the image element they don't have these same attributes you can't put one of these just inside any H EML tag so now we're ready to get started with some specifics of HTML in the following videos
