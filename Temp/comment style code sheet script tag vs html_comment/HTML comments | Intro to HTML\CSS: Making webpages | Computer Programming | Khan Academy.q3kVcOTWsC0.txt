everything that we've put in our web pages so far has been either content displayed by the browser or tags to tell the browser how to display it sometimes though we just want to put information in our web pages for other humans to read and for the browser to ignore to do that we write an opening angle bracket exclamation mark two dashes and some text inside here and then two dashes and a closing angle bracket we call this a comment and it's something that we do in all sorts of programming languages because we often want to do things that are just for humans that's the thing about programs they're not just for computers to look at they're also for other humans to look at because we often work together on things and learn from each other okay what do we use comments for besides just saying hello to our fellow humans well we might use them for letting people know where content came from look if they want to update it I'll say this paragraph is based on the Wikipedia article nice probably I should give a link to that too but this personal opinion very well trusted source and then you know maybe we'd even say give a link in inside the comments say this these lyrics were here and that helps people know how I got the content of this page do you notice something about these comments they are all green that's because we're using a code editor with syntax highlighting and it uses colors to help us see what's what and comments are pretty much always colored green by convention we could also use comments to comment out parts of our HTML like if we want to experiment with taking something away from our webpage we just surround it with a comment good now the browser no longer sees that HTML because browsers ignore everything in comments and that part is gone from the page if I decide that I actually liked it I can comment back in by removing those comments both sides and now it's back remember comments are for humans at least the kind of humans that like to look at webpage code which is pretty much all of us now right
