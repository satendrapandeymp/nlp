welcome to the eighth tutorial on beginning HTML we're going to continue on with images and specifically today we're going to cover resizing and sizing your images so we'll use the same code that we did from the last video and if you deleted that I will open that up now and you can go ahead and hit the pause button and just copy this and we'll continue I now so similar to the last video make a folder called HTML source and put the image and the HTML file in the same folder now before we move on I want to make a couple points first is you usually use jpg for your best images so if you have a beautiful landscape that you want to display you should use a jpg image but if it's something like a logo or some little artwork that you're doing you probably should use a PNG file or a jiff file so that's kind of the general standard and of course here I'm using a jpg file because this is a nice wonderful photo of Washington DC ok so let's go ahead and open up the source now and I'm going to show you how to resize an image but actually before we do that let's open up this HTML document in IE and there you get an idea that's just a huge image so this was a realistic website we were doing we would want to actually change the size of this image and I will show you how to do that right now so let's go ahead and reopen this up in notepad and between this angle bracket and the ending quote we're going to go ahead and put in a parameter called width and we're going to say that equals and we have to put this in quotes to 200 and that is pixels so 200 pixels and then we also have a height attribute and so we will go ahead and make that 200 as well and let's do a save and let's reopen this and you can see it's much smaller now now that might be too small we could increase that you know to 400 whatever but you get the idea now I want to point something out here to you that resize that we just did is done within the browser so let's imagine that I'm sitting at a remote computer here at some other location around the three and this source is on the server so this is being sent to my browser the resize gets done on the users browser so what I'm saying there is the original image is sent in its full size so if we take a look at this image you'll see it's still a huge image so that will get sent to this browser and then the browser will read that HTML document and resize the image so the point of guess I'm trying to make here is that that's a lot of overhead for a huge image like that so I'm guess I'm saying if you're making some minor adjustments to the image you can go ahead and use that width and height attribute but if it's an extremely large image you may want to just reduce the image itself in one of the Photoshop editors so if we went to for instance Microsoft Paint we could go ahead and resize it right here and we wouldn't have to put the attributes in the HTML code so that is how that works okay I will see you guys in the next 80 ml video
