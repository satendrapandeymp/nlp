all right everyone welcome to your 50th html5 tutorial and in this lesson we're going to finally give this baby some functionality making a work making something happen whenever we click the Save button so basically like I said what we're going to be doing is making a variable now every variable has a name and a value so right now whenever we click this nothing happens but eventually where we're going to be doing is setting this is the variable name and this is the variables value and just displaying the information over here to verify that this program does indeed work so let me go ahead and do that right now so now that you got your HTML file and CSS file setup hop over to your JavaScript file now the first thing that we want to do is a function and that happens as soon as the window loads this kind of kicks off everything so just go ahead and on your window put ad e event listener now this of course takes three parameters the first one is load what do we want this to happen as soon as the window loads what do we want to happen call a function call to do first now we're going to be building that function in just a couple seconds and the less parameter is false and if you guys watching my previous tutorials you know why so basically we want to call the function do first as soon as the window is done loading or the webpage is done loading so let me go ahead and build that function right now function do first and this takes a parameter of nothing in other words no I'm just going to confuse you guys don't even listen to me just I'll put this tutorial on mute and you know just following really this is probably your best bet but anyways the first thing we need to do is we need to reference this button right here now we need to reference it because we need to say ok whenever they click this button that's when we want to save the data so we need to reference that through variable called button I'm going to name it button and how we do that is document get element by ID now if we look the ID of the button is button so whenever we reference that ID it knows that we're talking about this button right here so get element by ID and the idea of that is button so now the variable button references this button right here simple enough so now what we want to do is we want to add an event listener to that bun because remember an event listener is something that sits on an element in this case it's going to sit on the button and wait until you perform an action to that button so what action is it going to wait for it's going to wait till we click that button now it says ok whenever you click that button what do you want to do well I just want to call a function called save crap so it's basically a function that's going to save all the crap so now let me go ahead and you're thinking okay well where is that function is save crap built into JavaScript no they would never build a function that was named something so inappropriate only I would do that so let's go ahead and build that function right now function save crap so basically whenever they click that bump button this function is going to be called now remember like I told you what we're doing is we're going to be inserting two pieces of data in here whenever they click this button it's going to call a function called save crap what save crap is going to do is take the value of this which is right now I'll put like person in here and the value of this which is Bucky and it's going to save basically a variable called person and that variable is going to have the value of Bucky so the first thing we need to do is we need to reference the contents of this so we already know how to reference this entire element itself by get element by ID because check it out plus I'll say in a second when I'm talking about 1 equals document.getelementbyid d okay so document get element by ID and remember this very first text area the idea of it was one so whenever we try to get element by ID and press one it's not going to get the contents of here what it's going to do is it's going to set this equal to this whole entire thing but this whole entire thing isn't the variable only the contents of it is the variable so we can't set equal to document get element by ID one we need to set it equal to document get element by ID one the value of it because the value of basically a text area is the contents inside that area so basically whatever we typed into that text box it's now going to be stored in the variable one simple enough so basically now one would be equal to the word person so now we just need to do the exact same thing with another variable so two and two and here's another thing you know how I told you guys that this first one was pretty much the key and the second one was pretty much the value but I didn't want to name it key in value here is why I don't like naming any um text area of value when I'm working on the JavaScript because it already has a property called value so if I put variable 2 equals document.getelementbyid d value value it may be kind of confusing especially if I name this variable value so that is why I chose the variable names 1 & 2 rather than key in value I hope you understand so now what I'm going to do is basically this I have a variable all set up this is the name of the variable 1 and this is the value of variable 2 so how do I actually save it well here is where we get to the good stuff we use something called session storage now session storage is a class that's built-in to html5 now it has a method called set item now usually whenever you have methods that we don't or functions rather I guess or calling JavaScript that we don't usually see we're going to need to build them ourselves but this function actually built into html5 what it does is it takes two parameters in this case one and two it basically creates a variable that the user is going to store now the key of that variable is person and the value of that variable is Bucky so it pretty much creates a variable with the variables name being the first parameter in the variables value being the second parameter so typically I think more technically they're called keys instead of names but I could say variable names and the variables value of is of course the value so what we did in this line of code is we basically created a variable that we're going to store on the user's computer so now that we did that I'm going to call one more function and that is should I even do this in the store oh I think I'm going to save with it next tutorial because I got a one more function in one more line of code to go in this but whenever I explain it I want to explain it thoroughly and I don't want to run out of time or bore you guys so go chill out soak all this knowledge in go grab a hot pocket some hot chocolate some more hot stuff come back when you're ready to learn and we're going to be finishing up this program so thank you guys for watching do subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next lesson
