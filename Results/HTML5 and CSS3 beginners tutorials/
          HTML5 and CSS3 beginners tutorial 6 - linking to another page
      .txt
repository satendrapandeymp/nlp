hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 6 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about linking to another webpage okay so before we can actually link to another webpage we need to make one so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this and I'm going to go to a new document you just paste it and save it as something ok so I'll save it as second second page dot HTML okay now make sure that you save it in the same folder as your index file okay so I've basically got a folder for each one of my tutorials so far and because this is tutorial 6 I've got one index dot HTML file here so this second page file just needs to be in the exact same folder otherwise this isn't going to work because I haven't spoken to you guys about directory paths or anything yet ok so just make sure that in the same file or the same folder and now we've got these two web pages that actually look exactly the same so just so that we can tell the difference I'm going to put a different header on each page so the first page can have a header and it can just say home page or something and the second page will also put a heading 1 but this heading can say this is the second page exclamation mark okay so now we can tell the difference between these two webpages so now we can actually put a link to one page and then see what that turns out looking like ok now to put a link on your page you have to actually type in some text that'll take you to the next page okay so I'm going to put a paragraph here on this first page and we'll just say would you like to go to the second page question mark okay so we've got this paragraph here and now we can choose certain words that the user must click on to go to that second page okay so I'm just going to go ahead and surround the actual words second page with our link okay now to make a link you're going to use this thing called an a tag and a stands for anchor why they decided to name it a link an anchor tag I don't know but hey they did it so we got to deal with it and we'll go ahead and end our a tag okay so that's a and ending a but to just simply surround our tag or our words with an a tag doesn't really make much sense because how is HTML supposed to know which page to link to okay and that's where these things called attributes come into play okay because we can't just put an a tag HTML doesn't know where to go or what page the link to so we need to give it a little bit of extra information and that is what attributes are there for though attributes are these little bits of extra information that some HTML tags need to work so to tell HTML where we actually want to send the user to when they click on this link we use the href attribute okay so this you're going to put in on every single one of your links and we're going to set this equal to something okay so what we have to set our href equal to is the location of this page now because are in the same folder I made it easy for myself and all I have to do is type in second underscore page dot HTML so I just have to type in this pages name so now when I go ahead and I save this and then I run this in Firefox you can see I've got a link here it's turned blue it's underlined and when I click on it I go to the second page so here with the first page I click on it we go to the second page so that's pretty cool our link is working and the reason why is because of this href attribute so that's a what that's there for okay so we've covered how to link to another webpage on our computer but what happens if we wanted to link to another website altogether so in other words we wanted to link to Google or something okay well then we can just change this paragraph up a little bit just to say here search on this great website Google okay and then we just surround the word Google with our link tags which are a and ending a and for our HR if we have to put in the full URL for the Google's website so we have to go ahead and put in HTTP colon slash slash www.google.com okay so that's Google's full URL and now when we go ahead and we save this and go back to Firefox click refresh you can see we've got a link here to Google and when we click on this we go through to Google so how cool is that we've just linked to it not only a different web page on our website but we're also linked to a completely different website altogether okay so that's all I have for you guys in this video thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys next time
