hi I'm ash from Evil 12.com in this video I'm going to show how to create a script that will show and hide a div and so if we go into and this is going to be using jQuery as well so you're going to need the jQuery JS file in the directory are somewhere where you can link it to so first of all in this index.html page I'm just going to get some necessary files so first of all it's the style sheet so Styles dot CSS and the type is text file a CSS finishes off style Shh okay so now we've a LinkedIn style sheet I'm going to do is we need to get the the jQuery file sort of tactful as lash JavaScript and the sauce is um jQuery dot is and I'll start it so we can end that flare um okay so now we need to actually create a div so the div ID is going to be a data it's going to contain some data and in here which one to put this is some data that can't be hit okay so now we've got that if I just refresh we have something that just looks a bit like that so what I want to do is just and we're going to create two buttons actually above this so input type you could use the button for this but and I'm going to stick to input type and just type a button in here and the ID is going to be show and the value is show data don't worry about these at the moment I'm going to cut this down and put hide and hide data so now we've got something else like that don't worry too much about the buttons just yet and because what we're going to do now is actually let's just finish off this code here so we need to actually get the sex file slash JavaScript source is M I've named it a show/hide is follows our script okay so now what we can do is inside M which one should we do first in JavaScript I see it yeah well do the CSS one first and so inside CSS we're going to create a height and that is going to get the this that's going to be the button so when the page loads display:none so when the page loads the hide button and will not be shown okay and we can do the same for show but we want to show this so so when the page loads we want it to be displayed but we're going to change this and down in JavaScript so to start with we need to just put trim in there and and the data and display none so when the page loads and there is nothing that displayed and we only get the show data bottom and then when we click show data and the show data bottom will change to hide data and the data will be shown and then when you click hide in vice versa and okay so now on to JavaScript to actually start coding this button what we can do is if we go to create something like and so show till the show button dot click so when the button is clicked I'm going to create a function right in here and the function is going to be so I'm going to show the CSS so I'm going to be editing this line here and what we want to do with that is I want to change the display to none okay so if I just tell his out so when I click this and it will disappear and from flash I get it back and so now now it's gone we need to actually show the data so we can basically just put data dot show like that and and we need to do the same for DM hide button so hide dot show okay so now if i refresh this and click on show data and as you see the bones not shown let me just have a look that's because I've missed the hash sign out there so try again show data it changes hi data and we get the data being shown okay so now to actually put this in reverse order it can basically just copy this code and instead of putting showing change up to hide and once again just reverse them also hide and you can leave data up or change so to hide and show to em and actually know that's going to be show and we need to show that okay so this should work perfect financial data get the data and the hide button now appears we click hide and the data disappears and the show data button reappears so that is how to hide and show lives using JavaScript or jQuery and I will plant annotation and at the start of this video and at the end so at the start and at this point now and we've a link to another video where I will show you how to create that using animation so it will slide up it'll look a bit more fancy instead of just being plain text and and just disappearing instantly so we'll have a little bit of a animation and it will have a little bit more of a fancy look to it so keep a lookout for that annotation and also if you subscribed then you will probably be able to notice whenever bloated that video so it will probably be next week sometime so if the annotations there then I've already uploaded it if it's not then and don't move it it will be uploaded soon so thanks for watching and I'll next time
