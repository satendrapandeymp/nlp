hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I right-click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad and minimize it let me right click once again on the first page dot HTML open with the Firefox I maximize the notepad in the previous tutorial we understood how we can change the size of a text how we can change the style of a selected text how we can apply color to the text we use the font tag to change the size style and color of some text I am going to select this content from here and I delete file save go to browser refresh no content now what I do here I write here hello HTML file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello HTML got displayed I want to increase the font size I want to increase the size of this complete hello HTML so what I have to do I have to use the font tag just before this hatch character I am going to write font opening tag after the yell character I am going to write closing font tag so opening tag indicates the beginning of the selection and the closing tag indicates the end of the selection so you can say like you have selected this much text to apply some style now if I have to increase the size of the test text I am going to use the size attribute so size attribute I assign the value to it in double quotations 7 file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello HTML got displayed in 7 size I copy this content from here and paste it down file save now what happens here is you should remember that font tag is an inline tag so inline tags we know that they are going to take only required amount of space on the browser so what happens here means this hello.html get displayed with the size seven just in front of this previous HTML let me show that file save go to browser refresh you can see that this hello.html got displayed in front of the previous hello HTML if I have to move this hello HTML to the next line I have to use the break tag right so I write BR tag file save go to browser refresh you can see that this hello.html got displayed in the next line similarly if I have to write one more hello HTML I am going to copy this and paste it file save go to browser refresh one more time I got the hello HTML if I have to change the color of this text I have to use the color attribute right so I give a space then I write here color equal to in HTML there are two ways are there for applying a color I am going to discuss about color in little bit detail in this tutorial and in the next tutorial we can apply a value to a color attribute in two different ways one way is we can use directly the color name itself so there is a list of color names in history ml already predefined color names are there you can use them directly here I can write the color name red now what happens this hello HTML is going to be displayed with red color file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed in the red color if I want to display this in green color what I do I write here color attribute then I give the value as green file save go to browser refresh you can see that this hello.html got displayed in the green color I can assign a value here color equal to B lue blue file save go to browser refresh you can see that I am used color names I copy this from here again I paste I want to display this hello HTML with another color maybe I want to display with black color file save go to browser refresh this in a black color only I copy this again I paste here down this time I want to display the text with cyan color file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed with the sine color I copy this again paste it down this time I am going to display the text in magenta ma GNT a magenta color file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got this paid in a magenta color let me copy here I am going to give the color ye ll whoa Welo file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello.html got displayed in yellow color I can copy this and paste it once again now I am going to display the hello HTML with white color file save go to browser refresh actually the text is got displayed here you can see that it is in a white color as background also in a white color we can't see the text no problem hope you guys have understood how we can use color names directly to apply the color to specific text there is one more way we can apply the color one more way we have that is by using hexadecimal value now what is hexadecimal value for every color there is a hexadecimal value I discuss about hexadecimal value in detail in the next tutorial let me show how we can use hexadecimal values ok let's start I copy this content from here and I paste just before this tag now here if I say like this first hello HTML will get display with the ready color then this hello HTML is going to be displayed just in front of this hello.html okay after that we will be having the break tag okay so try to understand now let me give here the color as a black file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello HTML this hello.html got displayed in front of the previous hello HTML which is in the red color the reason is font tag is a inline tag it is not going to move the next content to the next line understanding we must ensure to use the break tag to move the content to the next line so if I have to move this content to the next line of course I have to use a break tag so I copy this I paste over here only I paste it in this place file save go to browser refresh you can see that hello HTML got displayed in the next line so what I do now means I am going to paste this content okay I am going to paste this content copy and paste okay and I move this to the next line here I am going to paste move this to the next line Here I am going to paste move this to the next line similarly here I am going to paste move this to the next line Here I am going to paste move this to the next line Here I am going to paste and move this to the next line now what we have here we have red then black then a break Green black break blue black break so file save go to browser refresh you can see that it is going to be displayed something like this okay hope you guys are understanding now what do you want I want to display this hello HTML in red color here I have used the color name black instead of that I can use the red color name it will get display in the red color because already we have seen that it is possible instead of that I can use the hexadecimal value see here what I am doing I use hash ff0000 now if I say a file save go to browser and refresh you will see this text will get display in the red color can you see that now what I want next I want to display this color this text into green color to display this text into the green color I am going to write here instead of that I can use green also I am NOT going to use the color name I am going to use the hexadecimal value hash 0 0 F F 0 0 file save go to browser refresh you can see that this card displayed in the green color but a little bit pure green color we have here next what I want I want this text to be displayed in the blue color so I am going to use an equivalent blue color hexadecimal value that is hash 0 0 0 0 FF file save go to browser refresh you can see that this text got displayed in the blue color next I want to display this text in the black color itself either I can use the color name right or I can use the hexadecimal value the hexadecimal value for the black color is hash 0 0 0 0 0 0 file save go to browser refresh you can see that it is displayed in the black cover itself next I want to display this hello HTML that I have here in the cyan color so the hexadecimal value for the sign color is hash 0 0 FF FF file save go to browser refresh you can see that this text got displayed in the cyan color I move down I move this also down now what I want is I want to display this text that I have here in the magenta color so how do we display that I can use the color name magenta our I can use the hexadecimal value hash FF 0 0 FF file save go to browser refresh you can see that this text got displayed in the magenta color similarly I have here another text which is in a black color I want to display this in yellow color either I can use the color name yellow or I can use the equivalent hexadecimal value that is hash FF FF 0 0 file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed in the yellow color now I copy this from here and paste it down I want to display this hello HTML in a white color I can use either white color name or I can use the hexadecimal value hash FF FF FF file save go to browser refresh you should see here two texts which are in white color so there are two ways are there for applying a color to a text either you can use the color name or you can use the equivalent hexadecimal value in the next tutorial I am going to discuss about what actually this hexadecimal value mean okay so for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more information thank you guys thank you very much for more benefits please subscribe like
