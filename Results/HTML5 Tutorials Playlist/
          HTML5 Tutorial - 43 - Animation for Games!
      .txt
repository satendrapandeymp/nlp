what is going on guys welcome to your 43rd html5 tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to be teaching you guys about animation on the canvas now you can use animation for a lot of different things but my guess is that most of you guys are most interested in games so I'm going to be showing you guys how to move your mouse around and how to animate your canvas so shapes or anything can follow along with the mouse but if you want to make a game you can just make it animate on its own through a timer or a lot of different things but the easiest way I can demonstrate animation is just to follow the mouse cursor around and that's the basics once you get the basics of animation and how it works then really everything else is just up to you so the first thing we need to do is we need to add an event listener basically every time we move this mouse even a little bit we want to have a function that gets called so let me just go ahead and copy this and it stays on the window because you know that's the same thing the only thing that's different is this alowed change it to Mouse move and this do first this do first is this function so we don't want that just make another function call it Bucky if you want that sounds like a good name so basically what we're seeing is every time the user moves the mouse this function Bucky gets called so I guess it would probably be a good idea to build this function Bucky so function I've got a frog in my throat here Bucky II now this parameter II we passed in that's the event basically that's how can I explain this the object not the object come on whenever the mouse moves all the information is stored in the variable E that's a pretty good explanation actually so now the first thing we want to do is whenever we begin an animation we want to make sure we're working with a blank canvas so canvas mm clear rect now what this does is basically takes a shape as a parameter and it clears all the pixels in it so basically what we want to do is clear our entire canvas so start at 0 0 and our canvas size or mine Elise is 600 by 400 so 600 by 400 basically make a rectangle that is completely covers your canvas in clear each time that's the first thing we need to do the next thing we need to do is we need to get the x position in the Y position of where your mouse is on the screen so if it was up here it would be at 0-0 if it was like right here it would be at 100 300 so we need to get that information and then with that information we're going to tell the shape where to draw so go ahead and make a variable just call it like X position or X pause and the information like I said is stored in that variable E and it's actually called client X so what this is is basically the horizontal coordinates of the mouse event so if your mouse was at like 100 300 then the value of x position would be 100 if it was over here it would be 200 300 so now that we have the x value of where the mouse is we need to get the Y position of the mouse so let's change your variable and put each client Y so as you can see all of the information of that mouse movement or that Mouse event is stored in the variable E so we just go ahead and use that variable which is technically an object and pull some data from it and store in variables so now if our mouse was at 100 200 100 would be X position in 200 will be Y position and why do we need that information well we need it right now because we're going to draw a rectangle and what we want to do is we want the rectangle to draw wherever the Mouse's so campus and remember how to draw rectangles fill rect and the first two things you write is basically where on the screen do you want to draw it well instead of 0 0 like I think we did before just put X pause and y pause so now that we have the coordinates of where the mouse is and we're telling the canvas to draw a rectangle right there we need to say okay but how big do you want that rectangle well let's just go ahead and make a simple square 100 by 100 so let's go ahead and save this and see if I messed up at all now check it out nothing's happening right now because it waits until I move my mouse over this white part now once I do check it out a square now follows me around and even though you think of animation is kind of things moving on their own and you just watching like a movie this is actually even more advanced animation from that if you wanted to do that instead of just having you know moving a mouse around you would just put a timer like and I don't know maybe change this Y position every to increase it by 10 pixels every second or something and when you do that it would just move 10 pixels every 10 seconds but anyways this is typically the animation style that you use for games in every scene ok one thing is kind of annoying about this that my mouse isn't in the center of the square and that's kind of bugging me it's always stuck in the top-left well in order to do that all you need to do is put X position minus 50 and Y position minus 50 this is going to move the square up 50 pixels and left 50 pixels and it's going to pop your mouse right in the middle so let me go ahead and refresh it and check it out so if you're ever having trouble with the game or something then that is how you do it just shift the shape or the image up until it centers the mouse and it's always half of the size so another thing that you may notice is you're saying okay Bucky I understand all this stuff but why do you need to clear the canvas that doesn't really make sense well you need to clear because if you didn't clear every time this square right here it would draw over and over and it would never get a race that would kind of look like a drawing program or paint program so let me go ahead and actually just comment this out I shall just go ahead and cut it for now and check out what happens whenever we don't clear it as you can see we get like a drawing program so you know if you weren't making in the game and you want it to make a drunk program like Photoshop or paint then you could do it this way pretty cool so um yeah I think that's pretty much it like I said a lot of you guys are probably looking forward to building games with html5 and a lot of you probably didn't even know that you could build games with html5 but it's one of the awesome things you can do so many things with it can replace Flash in Java and this is like a whole nother world of possibilities this canvas but typically like I said you want to make sure you clear your rectangles and clear your canvas before you start some crazy animations so for now I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial thank you guys for watching and I will see you next time
