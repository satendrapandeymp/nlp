hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial I am going to discuss CSS box model it is one of the most important concept to understand box model if you understand clearly then you can be able to create more flexible and manage ML web page layouts so let's get started you can imagine every HTML element as one box which is meant to hold a content the amount of space required to display the content is actually known as content area and the space around the content that you see here is known as padding you can independently control left padding top padding right padding and bottom padding or you can at a time set the padding around the content so you can imagine like padding is a space around the content you can set border to a HTML element you can see the border is going to be set around the padding or the content you can independently set the border top border right border bottom border or left border or you can at a time set the border for the whole element and the space around the border you see here that is actually known as margin area you can independently set left margin top margin right margin bottom margin or you can set at a time a margin around the border or element I am going to demonstrate it so that you people can clearly understand which one is the content area which one is the padding which one is a border what is margin etcetera so let's get started I go to start say notepad hit enter then I write here opening HTML closing HTML and then I write opening head closing head then I write opening body and closing body tag in between the head section I am going to read opening title tag and there I say box model demo closing title tag file save as I save the file with the name as box model demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and save the file at desktop you can see that the box model demo dot HTML page got created i right-click on it open with the Firefox you can see here box model demo dot HTML page got open untidily set as box model demo you can understand it's something like this you can think like body as one box inside that i am going to create another box that is going to be a div element a closing div we know that div is a paid tag and it is a block level tag inside that we can put some content or we can add some other HTML element at present I have a content I am going to copy that content okay I copy this content from here and paste it in the div I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that div has displayed the content on the browser window and we know that div takes the entire available width let's proceed further to prove that div is a box or every HTML element is a box I am going to take help of CSS so I write opening style tag and a closing style tag in the head section and I say type is equal to text or CSS to indicate that whatever we write in between these style tags is going to be text or a CSS and then I tell to the system locate every div element in this current page and set the background color to pink color if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the div element has the background color set to pink quite simple then I am going to set the font size font - s-icd font size I said to 18 PT semicolon file save guru browser if i refresh what happens means the font size of the content which is available in the div is going to be increased to 18 point of course if I increase the font size definitely the content size increases if the content size get increases automatically the div element size also gets changes let's see that if i refresh you can see that now the content got displayed in a larger size and also you can carefully observe that the height of the div element is increased than before right now we proceed further then I set here P ext text al IGN aligned to I say justify justify semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see the paragraph is actually justified are the content in the div is actually justified good now we need to understand one of the most important thing is if you do not have a padding around the width of the div element is actually equal to the width of the content let me discuss here if I say here WI D th width of the do should be 400 pixels actually what this width property does it sets the width of the content it sets the width of this content is going to be 400 pixels if we change the width of the content to 400 pixels what happens we understand file save go to browser if i refresh you can see that the width of the content is set to 400 pixels and you can see automatically the content is moved to the next line and now the height is increased as the height of the content increased you can also observe the div element width and height changed the div element widths also set to 400 pixel and height is set to according to the content height this is most important thing to understand guys let me explain here if i say here height heig HD height of the content to 400 pixels then the height of the div is also going to be set to 400 pixels file/save guru browser and refresh you can see automatically the div height also gets increases do not think that content is only this much high content actually has 400 height it is up to here so it is not necessary that I need to mention the height let's the system calculate the height so we need not worry about the height file/save guru browser and refresh so you can see the height is now automatically calculated by the system itself now we proceed further and understand hope you guys have understood what is width width indicates the content wide the amount of space taken by the content to get display on the browser window okay next we proceed and understand the padding padding indicates the space around the content to make it good-looking if you want to give up healing look then you can add padding around the content for example now what I do is I the padding let's take I add a padding P a double D ing padding - le ft left padding left adds a space on the left-hand side of the content so padding left I give 20 pixels if I say like that file/save guru browser and refresh you can see that we got a left padding there is a space between content and the border of the div element and also you can see the width of the div is increasing but the content width is not increasing content is 400 pixels only but the width of the div element is increased to four hundred and twenty pixels actually I can add one more padding to the right pa double D ing padding righ T right I can say 20 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see on the right hand side we have added padding now actual width of the div element is 440 pixels because width of the content is 400 + left padding 20 so 420 + right padding 24 40 is going to be the width of this whole development on the browser window we can set padding top PA double D ing padding t.o.p top is also 20 pixels and I can say here PA double D ing padding Bo TTM bottom 20 pixels file save go to browser and refresh you can see we have padding of 20 pixel around the content that is actually padding I hope you guys have understood padding indicates the space around the content that is actually transparent actually okay instead of writing like this at a time we can set we can say here PA double D ing padding 20 pixels if you write like this automatically browser sets the padding left padding right padding top and padding bottom as 20 pixels file save guru browser and refresh you can see that there is no change remember that which indicates the width of the content not the width of the complete development next thing we understand is what is border so we are going to understand the border now we can apply the border we can apply border also independently if we want so we can say here border - top we can say here border top is going to be off maybe 10 pixels or we can set 20 pixels and it is going to be solid be la CK black color BL AC K black color semicolon if I say like that file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the border is set off 20 pixels at top similarly I can copy this and paste it down to say border left we say file save go to browser and refresh you can see bar left is added similarly I can copy that and say border right I can set righ T right file save go to browser and refresh so right border is added similarly I can copy that and paste it down it is going to be border be OTT om bottom I say file save go to browser and refresh so now you are understanding right so the here we have a Content area we have a padding around and we have a border around you should understand now what is actually width of this complete development 400 pixels plus left padding 20 and border left 20 so for 40 plus 40 so it is going to be 480 is the complete width of the development guys but content width is 400 pixels let's proceed further and understand instead of waiting like this what we can do is we can simply right Bevo rder border is going to be 20 pixels solid BL ACK black color so I say file save go to browser and refresh need no change you can see that it automatically sets water left border right border bottom bar atop to 20 pixels solid black hope you guys have wonders next thing we need to understand is what is margin so as I told margin is the space around the border or space around the element itself now let's talk about that here I am going to say m argi and margin - le ft left is going to be maybe 50 pixels if I say what happens means we are adding a margin outside the element here if i refresh you can see that we have a margin of 50 pixels from the body element border so similarly I can copy that and paste it and say here margin top margin top if I say 50 pixel they file save go browser and refresh we have a top margin also added you can see here if I say here I am telling the righ T right margin is also 50 pixels if I say files saved go to browser and refresh actually it has put some margin here we don't see because we don't have any content to be displayed are you understanding for example I can add margin I copy this and say margin Barham also 50 pixels margin be OTT om Barham 50 pixels file save go to browser and refresh actually here we have a margin bottom guys here we have a margin bottom set as we do not have a content we cannot observe that one so for this tutorial this much is enough friends hope you guys have understood what is box model and how it works whenever you are calculating the width of an element you need to add a margin left size plus boarder left plus padding left plus content width plus right margin plus right border size plus right padding height also same thing if you are calculating the height of an element occupied by it on the browser you have to add all these things top margin plus top padding plus top border size plus height of the content plus bottom padding size plus bottom border size plus bottom margin size if you add all those together you get the height occupied by that element on the browser so I suggest you to watch this video again and again and understand the box model clearly for more benefits please subscribe and don't forget to Like comment and share these videos with other so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing see you in the next tutorial thank you guys thank you very much
