hello friends welcome to JavaScript video tutorial series I right click on first script dot HTML page open with the notepad minimize I right click on first script dot HTML page open with the Firefox in the previous video tutorial we understood how we can display a text on the browser window we have displayed hello world text by using document dot write the write method is the one which displays given string on to the browser window what actually does it displays each of the characters one after the another from left to right top to down in the browser window in this tutorial I am going to discuss about whitespace how browser actually interprets whitespace what happens when we have more than one wide spaces in the write method so here I have given hello a lot of spaces and then word to the right method if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that I am not getting any spaces here the reason is if we have more than one whitespace browser is going to collapse those white spaces to a single space it actually collapses all those spaces to a single space final result is going to be like this file save go to browser and refresh we are getting the same result so remember that if you have many spaces maybe I can use a tab key to add more space the tabs are not going to be understood by the browser's all these spaces are going to be collapsed to a single space by the browser file save good browser refresh if I add more space file saved go to browser refresh I am getting the same result then how do we get more than one white ASIS if we want to get more than one white spaces or if you want to add more white spaces then we need to take help of HTML entity that is non-breaking space how do we write that we use ampersand then we write and be SP semicolon that is non breaking space it is an HTML entity friend it adds a single space which is non breaking space file save go to browser and refresh you can see that I got one space if we want more space then we need to copy this HTML entity and paste it as many number of times you file/save go to browser and refresh can see that I am getting more spaces I hope you guys have understood how browser interprets white spaces so remember that if you have more than one white space then browser collapses all those white spaces to single space if you want to add more white spaces then you have to use HTML entity ampersand NB SP semicolon that adds a single space remember that file save go to browser and refresh good next thing is I am going to discuss about how do you break a line let's take an example I want to display hello world one more hello world then what I can do is here in this write method after the hello world I can give one space and then I say one more time hello then wo rld hello world file save go to browser and refresh can see that I got one more hello world displayed on the browser window this is how the write method works friend if I want to display this hello world on the next line I cannot use I cannot write like this I can I cannot hit enter if I hit enter if I say file save go to browser and refresh nothing we see because this is not a valid JavaScript statement this is actually not a proper syntax at all okay so that is not possible what I need to do file save go to browser and refresh ease what I need to do to display this hello world on the next line means I have to use HTML break tag so I use less than BR 4 or slash rather than this is the break tag we know that break tag breaks the line right it moves the cursor to the next line file save go to browser and refresh you can see now the next hello world is on the next line how it is working step by step all these characters are getting displayed one after the another you can from here to here then browser sees there is a break that means it moves the cursor to the next line then this hello world will get display there are you understand so to break line we use the BR tag hope you guys have understood how do you break the line similarly you can perform breaking the line in many ways for example I have written here document dot write hello world file save your browser okay I can copy this and paste it one more time file save your browser and refresh you can see I got one more hello world but it is on the same line of course document dot right do not add any new line it won't break remember that JavaScript codes are executed top to down one statement at a time like this so what happens here when you say document dot write hello world okay this hello world will get display then again document dot write hello world you are telling that hello world will be getting displayed beside the previous hello world because you've been told to the browser that where to break the line to do that you have to use the BR tag so I use a br tag now we are telling to the browser that display this hello world then break the line then display this hello world file save go to browser and refresh you can see that that hello world got displayed on the next line whatever you tell to the browser it does as you have told so it is your responsibility to tell to the browser what to do step by step whatever you tell the browser does that so remember that give your instructions resize Lee in a proper way el browser everything in a proper way so that it performs it tasks in a better way it is programmers responsibility to tell to the browser what to do hope you guys have understood how browser interpret white spaces and how we can add break into the line for this tutorial this much is enough friend I suggest you people to try yourself some code by using the document dot write and the break tag for more benefits and be updated subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone will get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
