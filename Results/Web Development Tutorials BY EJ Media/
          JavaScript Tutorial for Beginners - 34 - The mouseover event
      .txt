in the last video we took an initial look at what events are and we covered the on click event and of course we set up a button so that when the user clicked on that button the on click event triggered JavaScript code in this video we are going to look at the mouse over event this event gets triggered when the user moves his or her mouse over an HTML element and this mouse over event works with almost all HTML elements so you can choose the element or elements that you want to change when a user rolls over that element now similar to the on click event the mouse over has the word on before it so it's actually on mouse over and you'll see it in a few seconds so again a mouse over event gets triggered when your user puts their mouse over a particular element so in this case we have a paragraph element so remember we need to place the event in our HTML element that's the first thing we have to do the element that we want to change so I'll go ahead and just copy and paste here and there you can see we have the on mouse over event that's what the name is and then we're going to call our function which I have named change background so when we hover over our paragraph element the background color over our text should change and then let's go over and take a look at our JavaScript code and you can see here I'm defining a variable text and we're doing what we've been doing right we're going to get the element ID para that's the first thing we have to do in our two-step process and then we have to do something in this case we're going to use the style object we're going to use the background color property which of course is part of the style object and we're just going to change that to red so let's go ahead and see what we get here and we'll launch this in chrome and there you can see we got our background color red but you'll notice that when I move the cursor off of the text the background color just stays up and that's probably not what we want we want this to be a little bit more responsive so what we want is when the user moves is cursor off of the text we want that background color to go away and we actually have to create another event to handle that so actually you get to learn about two events in this video two for the price of one so let's go ahead and set that up so we need to come back to our HTML code and add that other event and it's actually not onmouseover because that event occurs when we put the cursor over our element so we need to put the event right past our first event here which was onmouseover and I'll go ahead and copy and paste this in here and you can see it's called the on Mouse out event appropriately named so when we move our mouse off of this element the background color will go away and I've appropriately named the function back to normal so now we actually need to add this function so let's go over to our JavaScript code and we can just copy and paste what we had here and then we're just going to change this back to normal now what's different here is that we just need to get rid of our styling so we're doing the same thing we have to get the element ID we have to use the style object and then the background color property and all we do is just get rid of the red here the value and this will remove the styling and let's go back to our web page and you know what I need to put a quote there because this won't work without a quote big mistake okay we don't need to close we just need one so let's see what we get here and there's our background color and there you can see when we hover over it it works and when we go off it it did not work so I made a mistake so that's fine let's go back and see what we did wrong here what I did wrong so we have our back to normal function let's go over to our JavaScript code and take a look here ah take a look at that these function names are case sensitive I'm actually glad this happened you can see just how sensitive JavaScript code can be so let's try this again and now it should work hopefully and there you can see it works so you can see now how we can use multiple events to do multiple things in JavaScript okay that's going to do it for this video
