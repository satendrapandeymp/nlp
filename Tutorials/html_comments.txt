<para> Comment is a piece of code which is ignored by any web browser. It is a good practice to add comments into your HTML code, especially in complex documents, to indicate sections of a document, and any other notes to anyone looking at the code. Comments help you and others understand your code and increases code readability. </para>

<para> Here, the given comment is a valid comment and will be wiped off by the browser. </para>
