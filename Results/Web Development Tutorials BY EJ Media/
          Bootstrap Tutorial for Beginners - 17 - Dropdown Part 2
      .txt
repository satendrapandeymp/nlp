in this video we're going to continue on with the drop down menu and some little extras that you can add to your drop down menu so that's what we're going to cover in this video now the first I'm going to let you know is I added some margin around our drop-down menu and so what I did is I just created an ID of tests and our first div here and then I just created some CSS right here for that so if you want to go ahead and do that feel free so let's put back to our index.html now the first thing you can do is on our drop down menu you can add icons here you can add an arrow you can add a plus sign that indicates that this is a drop down menu and we do that with the span class in bootstrap so let's go ahead and do that and we put the span right after our text so that's we're going to do so let's go ahead and create our span and we just use the name carrot that's what that is good okay so let's go ahead and save this and let's refresh our page and see what we get and there you can see we've got a little carrot now see how that works and that's really kind of nice so that's one thing you can do now you notice how there's no space here between the N and the carrot if you want a space you'll have to go back into the text and just create a space right here and that will actually give you a little bit more room so sometimes that's a little bit confusing to people so let's say this will refresh this and there you can see they've got a little bit more room now after we added that space right here now the next thing we're going to take a look at is headers and dividers and what you can do is you can actually create a heading up here above our selections and so let's first do that we're going to go ahead and add a header and you guessed it it's actually another class that we call so let's go ahead and let's just take this first line right here we're going to copy and paste this right here now this is not a link it's just a header so we don't need this anchor tag anymore so we can go ahead and just get rid of that and then we're going to call another bootstrap class and we put that class in the first li tag that's how you do it so that's what we'll do and again we're just going to call another bootstrap class like I said and the name of that class is drop-down header and then you can put in whatever text you want and let's just go ahead and we'll just call this transportation how about that okay good so let's go ahead and save this and let's refresh our page and there you can see take a look at that we've got our header now now you can also add as many headers as you want so let's say we had a whole set of different options that we wanted but they were different types of options and what we're gonna do is go ahead and copy these three allies these first three Li elements right here and then we're going to go down here and we're going to go ahead and copy and paste that and let's say we're going to deal with different food types now so let's call this a hamburger and let's just call this french fries okay and of course let's rename the header and we'll call this food all right so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page again there you can see now we've got our second header but you see how this is kind of too close to the first header these two headings now are sort of crunched together you can actually add a divider between these which makes it look a whole lot nicer and it's easier on the eyes of your user they can see that these are two clearly different headings so let's go ahead and we'll add a divider now and let's just go ahead and take our heading here this this heading right here because it's kind of the same thing we're not going to add an anchor tag so we'll add it before our last li element in our first header so let's go ahead and copy and paste that and actually for a divider you don't even need text so we're just going to go ahead and get rid of that and the class we call is just simply divider it is that simple so to say divider here okay good that's all you need so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and take a look at that see that nice divider we've got we can tell that these are clearly two different headings okay that's going to do it for this video thanks again for watching
