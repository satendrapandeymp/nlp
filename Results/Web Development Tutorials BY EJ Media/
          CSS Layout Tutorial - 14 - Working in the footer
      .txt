in this video we're going to look at the footer and we're going to add some buttons as well some relevant information to the footer and so first let's take a look at the HTML and we'll scroll down here and here of course is the footer and it is empty at this point but we're going to enter some information into here right now now the footer sometimes does not get a lot of love but it should because you should put some relevant links about maybe yourself about employment or careers or even a Help section that's usually where this type of information goes and you might put a copyright in here so I'll show you how to do the copyright first and then we'll do the buttons so I've already typed it out and I'll just copy and paste in here as I always do now this ampersand copy will generate a copyright icon and I'll show you that in a second and then you want to put a semicolon and then whatever it is your copywriting in this case maybe your website and you say all rights reserved so let's go ahead and save this we'll open up our index.html and if we go to the bottom we see that we've got a nice little copy right here but we need to add some styling now and let's do that in our CSS spreadsheet so let's close this out and in the spreadsheet let's go all the way down to where our footer was and we need to add some more rules to our footer rule set so let's move right below our border-radius rule and i've already typed a sell out so as usual I'll copy and paste it so this will be the color of the text and I'll show you that in a second we're going to Center the text we're going to add 15 pixels of padding and we're going to actually set the font size at 90% and this is the one I want to talk about usually you want your fonts in the footer to be the smallest part of your website because it will usually be the least looked at obviously it's your main content that most people are going to be looking at so you want that enlarged but most web developers will actually set this at around 90% so again we're reducing that by 10% from what we set in our body up here at 14 pixels okay so let's go ahead go back down here and let's go ahead and save this and we'll open up our page and now we've got this nice and centered but we're going to put some buttons above this so this will fill in a little bit more in a few minutes so let's go ahead and close this out and now of course let's switch back to the HTML and of course we have to add ul and Li tags for our buttons and I've already typed that out so paste it in here and we want these buttons to be above our copyright notice so we'll go I'll go ahead and copy and paste this and there you can see I added an About section for our website a career section a Help section and a Contact Us section so let's save that up let's open up our index.html and you can see these will be unformatted doesn't look very good right now right but we're about to format them and these will look very nice so let's close that out now what we can do is actually copy the existing buttons that we had for our navbar and edit those that's the nice thing about CSS we can reuse some of this code now obviously we're going to put footer for each one of these but we can actually use most of this code almost all of it not all of it but most of it so let's go ahead and copy and paste all four of these rule sets right to here so we want the navbar ul the navbar uli the navbar ul I anchor and the hover so we're going to get all four of those rule sets and we'll put these right below our footer and let's just copy and paste now the first thing we're going to do is rename these to footer because we don't want this to conflict so this will be for the footer and again it's going to be the same for rule so that makes it really easy for us to reuse this we're just going to do a little bit of editing but it'll be very similar to what we did in the navbar all right let's save that and now let's start to edit these so we'll start first with the UL okay so for the first rule set right here we're going to get rid of the background color we don't want lack so we're just going to get rid of that now we will keep the in line the same we'll keep the display type is in line now for the anchor we're actually going to switch the color to that color and you'll see in a minute it's kind of like this beige color and for the background color we're going to use this X code and you'll see it in a few seconds so that's what we're going to change for the anchor rule set and we're going to keep the hover rule set the same as what we had in the nav bar so that's going to stay the same so let's go ahead and save this and we'll save everything up let's open this up we go down here and there you can see we've got these nice buttons now that will link to other pages in our website okay that is going to do it for this video now what I want you to do is I want you to rename this folder actually to liquid or flexible whatever you want to call it because we're going to look at fixed layouts in the next video so we're done with the flexible layout for now so go ahead and save that and then in the next video we'll get started with some new code for a fixed layout see you guys on
