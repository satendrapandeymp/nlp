hi as in the previous video we have already seen the introduction of HTML in a great detail now in this particular video we are going to start the implementation so in this particular video I'm going to use notepad plus plus as a text editor as here I am the Windows user and Google Chrome as my browser you can choose a basic text editor and a browser of your choice and then you can continue with the same example as I am going to do so let's see how to start the basic implementation of HTML so for getting started what I need is a text editor so as I said I am working in a Windows system so here I can use notepad or notepad plus plus to write the basic HTML and here I will use this notepad plus plus which is available online with the free of cost now here I can start writing the HTML using the basic elements that is tags which will help us in designing this document so what I will do I will start with the angular tag angular braces here which I call the tag alright so here I'll start with the HTML tag and we'll finish it up with the closing tag of HTML in closing tag I will just put the slash before the HTML or any particular tab so this is the pure tag which is having one opening and one closing tag so whatever I want to put in this HTML I will put all the things inside these two tabs now I will classify the complete document of this HTML in two main portions that is the head again with the opening and closing tag and once you will close the head you will start with the another section called body so basically what these two sections will do for us this head section will take all the resources and titles for example if for in the future you're going to put some JavaScript CSS or any particular library which you want to use later in the body you can put that all inside the head section and in body I will put all those particular portions all those particular elements which I want to display to the user over the main browser area so here in the head what I will do is I will put a title tag for now which will be shown in the title bar of the tab so here I will say first HTML page all right so for now let's save it and for saving I'll say ctrl s since it's windows and somewhere in your system as here I'm using II drive and HTML pages folder so somewhere in your system you can save it so let's save it with the name first dot HTML so you can add that HTML extension by yourself and since here I am working with node + notepad plus plus it will give me further options where I can choose the HTML all right so it will be decorated as HTML as soon as I save it you can see some formatting helps here in naught plus plus plus is highlighting the tags with the blue all right so since I have saved it let's try to see that in the browser for that I will come to the very location where I have saved my web page so it is e Drive HTML pages folder and this is the file which I just created so let's open this and here at the top of your tab you can see there is the title my HTML page and there is nothing in the money because I haven't put anything so as I said whatever you want to show to the user you can write that all right here for example my first HTML page I have saved I have to save it every time I'll come back to the browser and here I will refresh by pressing f5 or you can click over this button so it will see you my first HTML page whenever a client will request for this particular page the complete HTML is actually sent over the h3 protocol over the browser of declined so when you right click you can see view page source and here you can see all the raw HTML which I have used for creating this particular file so that's all about this video in our next video we'll go through some more basic tags
