alright guys welcome to your 40th XHTML and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to begin to talk about the last main topic that I want to talk to you guys about concerning basic beginner web development and that is the use of something called forms so before we pretty much made websites where basically we gave information to the user we showed them pictures we can write paragraphs show them headers make them click links but what happens when we need to get information from the user for example maybe we were building a social networking site and we need the user sign up with the username and password maybe we were building an auction site and we needed the user to give us information about their item let them upload pictures well in order to do all this we need to do something called forms actually they didn't say that right we don't need to do forms we we need to utilize the use of forms now a form is basically the way you input data to give to a website and this includes typing in your username uploading pictures selecting items from a drop-down list clicking radio buttons checking options all of that stuff is included in the special thing called forms so this is more XHTML than CSS but I wanted to save it for the very end because this is kind of the gray area between XHTML web development and web programming so this is basically I'm going to show you guys how to set up a form but in order to you know take that data and you know store in a database or maybe calculate it and give them back a number or an answer we need to add some computer programming in there and we're not ready for that yet so let's go ahead and first learn how to set up a basic form so the form starts out with the tag form and it ends with an ending tag form now all of your form elements such as all your buttons boxes um text areas are going to go in here so for example let me introduce you guys the most basic type of input and that is just a plain text box it's an area where the user can type just regular text for example if you want them to enter their email or pick a username this is where you would do that so for example you might have something like put user name where the user can choose your username so go ahead and write it so they know text boxes for and now in order to give you that input you need to type in the word input this is a special tag that you're going to be seeing a lot more in the future and now after this you have to say what type of input is it and I just want a plain old text input I want a place where they can input text in any ways so we know that this is a spot where they can input text but say we have a bunch of different places or excuse me a bunch of different inputs in our form we need to tell our browser which one this is so let's just go ahead and give it an ID but instead of ID we actually give a name so since this is the input for username just go ahead and put user name and the reason let's say this say you had one say you're making a website where you need their mailing address you have would have one input for their name one input for the road one input further country so you have three different inputs in the way you differentiate them is through the name so anyways let's go ahead and save this refresh it and see what we got here is that username just text username and here is that input box so now the user can go ahead and type in whatever they want let's see D looks like that would be a good username so I think I'll just use it to send a genie actually oh I know I know that's popping up because this guy he signed up on my forum and he was trying to spam it so I copied his name and I had to ban him so so anyways if you see this guy tell him to quit spam in my forum because it was annoying so anyways that is the basic the very basics of a text input but if you're saying Ari I mean that's pretty cool but I just want a little more control over what it looks like well by default it gives you like I don't know however many spaces this is wide if you want to change the size of this text input what you need to do is you need to add another attribute called size and whenever you fill this in let's say you want to change it to like I'll make it really noticeable just put like five or something and refreshes your now your input is now five I don't know what is it characters or five pixels or whatever it's just five long I don't even know what the you know the measurement is but anyways that is how you change the size of it from anywhere from five to fifty it can be actually any size you want there's 150 long so that's pretty cool but let me show you this even if you have a size of like 10 or something like that you might be thinking alright I don't want the user to enter a username or something more than 10 characters long so I just put size of 10 and that'll work but check it out they can still enter a username however long they want so the size is pretty much changes the view of it or how it looks if you want to actually limit the amount of characters they can put in then you need an another attribute called max length and you can set this equal to you know let's just set equal to 5 or something and now once we go ahead and let's get rid of the size attribute because we don't need that anymore and now once we go ahead and save this and refresh check it out the size is default but the user can only enter 5 characters since look do you hear me type in on the keyboard see I'm typing right now but it won't let me enter any more characters see five at most so anyways size is for how it looks max length is for how many characters do you want them to enter and the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is another attribute in the last attribute called value if you want to populate this box with something by default you need to throw in a value so for example if you go ahead and refresh this right now by default your box is going to be empty and that's because by default your value is empty if you want something like enter name here and save it by default whenever they load the page this is going to pop up right there enter name here so you can if you want to give them a description of what they're supposed to do on that textbox I usually put something to the left hand side and that's usually good enough but you can also put something in the middle or maybe this will be more useful if you're like um let's say if you're making a website - you know like New York's bans to sign up or something and by default you say choose your state and it says New York in there by default because most your users are going to be from New York it saves them a little trouble but still I like to leave a blank let them fill in their own data but anyways and that is how you use the basics of a form and also a text input and next couple tutorials I'm going to be teaching you guys about different kinds of input because there's a lot to go over in forms but stick with me guys we're almost done learning the basics of web design so I'm excited and you guys should be too so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next video
