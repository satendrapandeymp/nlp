up until now we've only briefly touched on the idea of headings so let's dig a bit deeper and learn all of the various headings that are available to us I will return to sublime and we have a fresh HTML page so right now you know about heading 1 tags when it comes to headings we have 6 what we call levels so we have an h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 so the biggest thing that you need to understand is when to use each of these and the best way I can explain it is by thinking of importance so if we think only in terms of SEO search engine optimization if you could only tell Google one thing you would probably want to put it within an h1 tag so this could be the title of a blog posting because that's the most important thing so I will rename this my awesome log posting and then here of course we would have the body of our posting but surely you'll want to have some subheadings as well but those won't be quite as important as the title of course so you might have an h2 or even an h3 for subheadings and then you could have maybe some additional information and this is a nice way to separate a blog posting so that you don't just have 30 paragraphs you can divide it so people can easily scan it's even possible within your subheading you have a specific point you want to make that's related to this topic but it's not a new topic on its own so that's when you can use h3 and h4 s and this is how it works it comes in order of importance so now let's think of it from the point of an actual website let's go visit net Tut's notice here we have headings so we have the title which is net Tut's but then you have each individual blog posting so let's see how we can figure out what that is in chrome I can right click and choose inspect element and this allows me to view the HTML notice this little magnifying glass right here I'm going to click that and now hover over whatever it is that I wish to review in this case it's the title so what we can see here is it's an level one tag and you can see he's doing that for each one so if we want to go down and look at the next one you can see that the same is being done here a heading level 1 tag ok well let's open up this blog posting now and see how this one is once again we have a heading 1 because that's the most important part of the page and let's come down here we have a subheading so let's see what that is we have a heading 2 because it's still quite important but it's not the most important thing on the page let's scroll down a little more and it looks like there are no heading 3 tags but we can add one just as easily so why don't we go to the conclusion and this time I will edit the paragraph tag just after it I will add a heading 3 hit enter and we are finished with that so I will escape out and now you can see that it's going to automatically receive any formatting that net touch has set up for heading 3 tags so we have a heading 2 and then a nested heading 3 because this isn't quite as important we need to specify this whole chunk is our conclusion but then we have a little bit of extra notes so you have heading 1 2 3 & 4 those are predominantly what you'll use the most h1 h2 h3 and h4 but if you can try to use h5 and h6 as well because these are very helpful for Google's BOTS so they can figure out exactly what your postings what your website is all about
