hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 8 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about directory structures okay so now we'll be able to start organizing things a lot more neater or a lot tidier okay so what do I mean by directory structure well I'm simply talking about the folder structure on your computer so basically this now the simplest kind of folder structure that we can have is called a single folder structure and that's where everything is kept in a single folder much like this okay so we've got my tutorial 8 folder and inside here is everything that I'm going to use on my website so my index page and all my images okay now this is what we've been doing for the past few tutorials so you guys know that whenever I want to refer to another file that's in the same folder all I have to do is type the name okay so that is how we load it up this image from the previous tutorial ok we just set the source equal to this image name okay now the reason that worked is because they're in the same folder ok so if I run this in Firefox right now you can see everything works my image shows up that's great but what happens if I want to start organizing my stuff into folders okay now that means that I would then be using something called an hierarchical folder structure so quite a big word there hierarchical I think that's how you pronounce it okay and that means that I need to go ahead and put all these images into a folder so I'll go ahead and make a folder called images and this one and that one they can go in there okay so now we've got my index file and then we've got the images in a separate folder okay now if I go back to Firefox and I click refresh well what the heck happened okay my image isn't working anymore and that's because when you go back to notepad plus plus we told our or we told HTML we told our HTML file to look for this file called H JPEG but we didn't tell it where to look okay so HTML immediately assumed that it must be in the same directory as in it must be over here but we can clearly see there is no ash JPEG file here okay so that's why HTML couldn't find it so HTML couldn't find that image okay now we have to go back to HTML until HTML no no we need to look in a specific place and you actually have to look in a folder called images and then you just have to separate your image name from your folder name with the slash over here okay so this thing over here is your directory path that's what it's specific name is okay and now when we go back to Firefox and I click refresh our image is back awesome okay so we gave Firefox the correct file path or the directory path okay but all we've actually done here is told Firefox or told HTML that they need to look one folder down and the folders name is called images okay but what happens if we want to go one folder back okay or one folder up okay then we've got to do that a different way so let me go to this folder again okay and I'm actually going to go back to tutorial 6 on page about links I'm just going to copy that second page over there and I'm going to paste it you don't want it there I want it in another folder called other pages so I'm going to go other underscore pages and then second page okay so I want to open this up in notepad plus plus and if you guys can remember this is the second page that we made in tutorial 6 where we linked to another webpage ok and what I want to do here is try and load that exact same image again so instead of actually typing those tags let's just copy this ok control-c control-v now when I save this and I want to try run this in Firefox what should happens okay we've got the header which was clearly on our page over here but then we only got the alt attribute of our image showing so Firefox again couldn't find this image okay and that's not because we did anything like bad or whatever it's just we didn't tell HTML where to look correctly this time okay because again hTML is now looking for this folder images and then looking for ash jpg okay so if we go back here you can see where those pages there clearly is not another folder called images so again that's where HTML got lost okay so we have to tell HTML go back one folder that was my phone go back one folder and then look for folder called images and then go to ash dot JPEG okay so we've already got the folder images here and we've already got ash JPEGs so we just need to tell it to go back one folder and the way we do that is we just type in dot dot and that's to go back one folder but we have to separate everything with us - okay so dot dot slash means go back one folder then look for the folder called images then get the image called ash okay so if we save this now let's just make sure we were right over here so we were in other pages and we said go back one folder go to images and look for the folder called ash okay so we found it with those instructions so HTML should find it too okay so let's go ahead now and run this in Firefox and as you can see this is the second page and there is our image okay so it's here our directory path was correct okay so that's all I have for you guys in this video thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and feel free to like the video comment or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys next time
