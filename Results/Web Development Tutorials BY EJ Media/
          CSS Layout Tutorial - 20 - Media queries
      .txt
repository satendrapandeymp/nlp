in today's very very busy world people are using all sorts of devices that have different resolutions you have people using desktops laptops tablets and mobile phones and basically what this means is your webpage has to fit on all these devices or people will go to another website so you want to make sure that your webpage is a one size fits all and you can do that with CSS media queries this is one of the very very powerful features in CSS and so I'm going to show you how to use that today now right now I have this on a desktop and it's at max resolution this is I think was nine hundred and sixty-four pixels or something but what happens if I minimize this and I start to go ahead and resize the window well take a look at that you can see here that the main content page is starting to disappear and now we just have the sidebar well what we want to do is resize this appropriately when the browser is minimized or perhaps they're looking at this on another device perhaps a tablet so what CSS media queries allows you to do is it basically allows you to resize your entire webpage you can do pretty much anything you want you could even put up new content if you wanted but a lot of times you're just going to be deciding which elements you want to display with this smaller pixel count and in this case we probably don't want to show the sidebar you always at a minimum want to show your main content panel and so that's what we're going to do once this is displayed in a smaller resolution we're going to go ahead and eliminate the sidebar and just show the main content and again we can do that with media queries and of course this is the same webpage we used in the last lecture so again what we're going to do is go ahead and get rid of the sidebar so here is the syntax for media queries you always use an @ sign then media and then this actually takes arguments and we'll get to that in a moment and then it's just similar to other CSS rules we need squiggly brackets now inside these squiggly brackets we place all the elements that we want to alter but first let's go ahead and put in our argument now this is where you specify the resolution so in this case we're going to specify the max width property there's other properties and we'll talk about that in future videos but for now we're going to use probably the most widely used one and that is max width and what we're going to do is specify 600 pixels now what this basically means is is if our web page is displayed on anything less than 600 pixels we'll go ahead and do whatever it is you tell CSS to do with inside of these squiggly brackets in this case again we want to go ahead and get rid of the sidebar so that's what this means basically this means anything less than 600 pixels go ahead and redo the web page whatever directive we issue and 600 pixels actually usually is the standard size of tablets so this will handle tablets as well as when the user minimizes the browser so let's go ahead and put in a rules and it's just like any other CSS rule so we'll specify sidebar and of course we have a class for that so we specify dot sidebar and then we need squiggly brackets for that right so let's go ahead and put that in right here and then what we want to basically do is hide the sidebar so what we're going to do is do display remember that property and we're going to set that to none that will basically completely obliterate the sidebar or get rid of it so let's see if this works let's go ahead and save this and we'll go back to our web page let's refresh this and let's go ahead and minimize this and take a look at that it worked look it's going and see how nicely that fits now very very nice indeed you have your main content on here and you don't have to worry about cluttering the page with elements that really aren't needed now we can do many other things too you can basically do anything you want you could add do elements if you want we could actually move this logo and in fact let's do that because see how the logo didn't move so let's actually float the logo left and so we'll go back to CSS media queries and let's put in a rule for that but you know we probably should actually give that an ID because we don't want to move all of our images so let's go to where our logo is just right here and let's just give this an ID of test1 and then let's go ahead and put in the rule for it and of course since this is an ID we need the hash sign and then we just specify our ID which of course is test1 and what we're going to do is just float this left now and you take a look at this we're keeping all these rules inside of our main media query rule so let's go ahead and save this and you know what I need to actually save the index.html as well because we put in an ID right here there we go and let's go ahead and refresh our webpage and let's see if this works now take a look at that it moved left and our sidebar of course is gone and everything is working so that is how media queries works okay as always thanks for watching
