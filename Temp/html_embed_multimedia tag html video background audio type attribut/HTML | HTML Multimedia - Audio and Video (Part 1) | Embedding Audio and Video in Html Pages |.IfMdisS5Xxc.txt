hello and welcome back to the last chapter the chapter 8 HTML multimedia audio and video and in this chapter this is actually my favorite chapter you know we'll be talking about how to embed audio and video in your HTML files and remember audio and video files embed in your website or your web page make your web page more interesting and appealing to the audience because today Internet is all about interaction it's all about getting to you know inserting information in the page and retrieving information from the page so it's all about interactivity it's all about making the website you know tell you more in a short amount of time so videos are descriptive pictures as we know motion pictures and audio is like you know something that he can hear and together they combine together to create a very powerful effect because text way some people most people I know do not like to read lines and lines and lines of text so in order to make a website more engaging and appealing you need to motivate the website viewers to be able to see the entire content all from the very beginning to the very bottom so embellish your website with the images with moving objects for example not too much but you know tastefully and embed your website with colors and also finally multimedia so the distractor I will conclude this entire HTML 1 course and I must tell you that the CSS again I repeat CSS has more capabilities than plain HTML but this is a great start for somebody who has never has very minimum experience on using HTML code so in the next course HTML 2 I will be talking about CSS coding and how you can make your website even more powerful by writing lesser amount of code and having a greater impact on your website okay so that being said let's move to the chapter objectives okay I have three objectives here video embedding audio embedding and adding animated text and before I begin I would like to tell you that I have created a folder here okay remember I teach my courses with the aid of organized folders so I have created a folder called HTML multimedia and within the HTML multimedia folder I have these following files I have a multimedia dot txt file which contains my HTML code and I have a multimedia dot HTML file that contains you know that implements the code then I have a sample dot mp4 file for video to show you how videos can be embedded on a website another page and I have a nice song here in here one of my favorites mp3 file that are downloaded from the internet to show you how you can embed audio in your web page okay so for this module or this part of the chapter I'll be dealing with video here it's called sample dot mp4 so if you open up your file here I have created a basic skeleton of the HTML file HTML code on the notepad notice the regular tags doctype HTML HTML tag the head tag and then within the head tag we have the title tag and the title of the pages HTML multimedia examples ok this copied and pasted this entire file from one of the introductory lectures that I gave off for this course and you can do the same to save yourself time or you can just pause this video and copy the entire text step-by-step so I have the title I have the head tag body tag contains an h1 heading cup soccer game I actually have a short video on how to do cup stacking cup stacking is becoming you know increasingly popular you have cups and you need to start them and he stacked them the shortest amount of time seems like this game is you know really gaining a lot of popularity around the world and people are creating Guinness Book of World Records people young as four years old are creating records and I decided to conduct this game in my classroom where I teach and I shot a video and I saved eight and I'm gonna use it as a sample for this webpage so it's just a cup soccer game and it's a very short video which is why I'm using it so that you know it can upload and download easily and we can save time but you can also embed along the video notice the file size of this video is 3.8 four megabytes which is fairly small and the length is just two seconds long okay just preparing you it's going to end abruptly but my focus is on the cold the bright coat and the right supporting tags for the code so that you can have a video an enjoyable video viewing experience on your website or your webpage alright that being said let's open this up and if you want to look at the code here the code that goes for this multimedia video embedding is very very simple it says video there you go how simple is this video the video type is typically written as video source is equal to okay SRC just like image source source is equal to the name of the file is sample right here so I'm gonna write sample capital S dot was it mp4 yes mp4 okay don't worry I'm going to check it again and since you know it's all about relative referencing and absolute referencing this file is located within the folder with the that contains the HTML and the dot txt file so I don't need to include the complete address of the video file I can just access it call it directly with its name no need to add all the layers here that this file belongs to you know inside this folder and then this folder and then this folder no need for that okay I'm going to directly access this file let's go ahead with the code okay you know the source part so this is how this video source video code opens video tag opens up and there is also an additional attribute called controls okay and it can be specified to provide user controls for the interface so that the user can stop star change the volume etc you need to be able to provide that kind of control to your users they should be able to play the video again and again they should be able to stop the video they should be able to mute the video so these kind of controls are very simple to add in your video tag okay and supported by the control attribute and within the control at attribute you can also have the dimensions the width and the height okay and they can be used to provide the width in the height of the video all right so let's go ahead and type out the code now I'm going to do the control attributes width is equal to 170 that's pixels and height that's going to be very small okay just watch and see is equal to 85 and then you're gonna say controls you're telling the browser I'm talking about controls here okay and which means just add controls as well okay and after you've done that you are going to close the time here close the video tag okay and I'm going to save this file let me just make sure you know the name of the file is correct and before yes that's correct many types of video files can be embedded in a website mp4 is the simplest one there is Oh Gigi and there is mp4 there is WebM okay there is au g v as well given many many types of video available for you that you can embed and the browser will read them successfully okay but right now I'm just going to stick to mp4 and I'm going to save this and I am going to also save as let me just do this once then I don't have to do it again and again okay and let me try to run this file okay okay I don't see the video itself there must be an issue let me check I see the controls but I don't see the video itself there must be a problem with my code here okay what happened let me check okay this is very simple this is what's missing is equal to sign is missing here so this is a syntax error unfortunately in the browser won't tell you that there is a syntax error you have to figure this out yourself but if you have a HTML editor it's going to tell you exactly what's wrong where it's wrong and how to fix it but that's not the that you know people who already know the language they use that but for somebody who's a starter again I say this is the best way to learn so let me try to refresh this page oh my god is such a small video okay short I can understand but so small I don't like this let me change the dimensions here let me make this bigger 300 and height to be 400 what do I get let me save and refresh much better that looks much better okay these are my students they are stacking cups and try to make a record okay their own classroom record but the idea is this is how you can you know upload a video or embed a video in your website and if you want you can change the dimensions further for example if you want perfect square video or a rectangle video you can do that as well let me try to save this and refresh it there you go okay seems like the dimensions it won't be a perfect square but it would be just like it's a ratio it's a split ratio it would automatically set the ratio so you can have more control of the video using CSS but HTML video tag will give you only this much control and what is this here okay this will take you to full-screen exit full-screen okay this is a great tool to have if you have a lot of videos in one page I'm gonna just have small videos and then the user has a control bar here that allows them to increase the screen size or it will allow them to forward the video and pause it or it will remove the sound for them and they also know how much how long the video is okay it's a two second long video with no valley minute okay so that's about it and then I also have a couple of more ways to embed video let me show them to you in the next video stay tuned
