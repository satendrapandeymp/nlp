in this video we're going to continue along with the orc object that we've been taking a look at in the previous three videos now I mentioned that we would take a look at some of the global objects that Java Script provides but I still had a few more points that I wanted to make about objects and our orc object will serve that purpose just fine so we talked about in the last video how you can change the value of the properties inside your object so we can switch the hair from green to purple and if we run this we get purple but not only can we change the value of a property in an object we can actually change the data type now you will remember there are three primary data types in JavaScript there are strings there are numbers and there are boo means the true or false so as I said we can actually change the data type in a property so let's switch this from a string to a number so we'll go ahead and set the value now to a number of course and of course it is going to be one so let's go ahead and run this and now we get a one now what if you wanted to add a new property well all you have to do again is specify the object and then the new property name which in this case is going to be hair two and we can do that as long as the property doesn't already exist inside of our object and of course we don't have a hair to property so we can go ahead and just add that down here so let's go ahead and write out hair two and we get red hair which of course is what we set the value to now you can also delete a property by using the delete keyword so again we just specify delete and then our object and then the property we want to delete so in this case we're just going to delete our hair to property which we just added right here and so if we write this out you'll see what happens now and we get undefined now you will get undefined if you try to write out a property that doesn't exist that's actually what will be returned because of course now we don't have this property and so we can't possibly write out a value so it comes back as undefined when javascript is unable to determine the value now we can also add a property without actually setting the value so in this case we're just adding hair to so it will be added to our orc but we didn't actually add a value to it we could add the value at a later time so let's go ahead and run this and we get undefined once again because once again we didn't assign a value to this we just added the property here too to our orc object now of course once we add a value we will be able to write out a value okay that's going to do it for this video now in the next video we will get to global objects that Java Script provides and the first global object we'll look at is the string object
