hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 40 and in this tutorial we're taking a look at part seven which is hopefully going to be the final part of our basic website layout miniseries okay so if you guys can remember correctly we finished the last tutorial or we left off at the last tutorial having a web page that looked something like this okay and we finally had our section and our aside floated next to each other and appearing next to each other which is exactly what we wanted but I did highlight a few problems in doing this is that whenever we add a border or a margin or a padding okay we need to take that into account whenever working with the total width of that element okay so let's go ahead and actually take a look at this in CSS and I already show you guys the border and margin so let's go ahead and see what happens if I added a padding of five pixels to this left side well then this means that I've added five pixels on the left of my left side and five pixels on the right of my left side which totals out to ten pixels that have been added to the total width of this actual glass or that element so when I click refresh you can see I've added five pixels over here and I would have added five pixels over here we just don't have enough content to actually see those five pixels that are there okay and what that did was take our aside and throw it down here and that's not exactly something we want so the quick solution I showed you guys in the previous video was just to take those ten pixels out of this width or the actual width of the element okay so now we'll work with 700 and or 676 pixels instead of 686 and when we click refresh at you know everything has turned out just fine we now have this padding around our section and we still have that margin and border etc but there is a better way of working around this because we can in fact just get rid of all of this and get rid of that and work with 300 pixels for our aside so 300 pixels and work with 700 pixels for our width of our left side okay and when we click refresh we still have our left side over here and our right side over here but whenever we wanted to add borders margins padding's etc we could do that to the elements that are inside of our actual left side and our right side so let's take a look at our left side and as you can see inside of here we've got an article okay and this is basically the perfect tag to style whenever we want to add padding margin borders okay and that means we don't have to fiddle around and make any funny widths over here or any funny widths over here on the right side okay we can work with nice round numbers and it's the same thing on the aside we're working with a div over here and a div over here and in between that we've got some articles and other stuff but you know what it's okay we can actually style these divs so let's go back to CSS and I'm going to go ahead now and say anything that is in the left side that is also an article so we're basically selecting all articles that are children of the left side class well what do we want to do with those well let's give them a border of two pixels solid red for now okay go ahead and save that and see what this looks like and you can see it's pretty much the same thing we now have a border but it didn't throw anything out of alignment it didn't kick our aside down to the bottom or anything like that so let's go ahead and continue making sure that this is safe let's add a margin on the right of a let's say ten pixels a hand will also give this a padding of five pixels okay in fact let's make a bigger padding of ten pixels so when we save this now and click refresh you can see we now have that extra bit of space there so we our margin has indeed worked and we've also got all of the space around the top and on the sides and on the bottom of the section so our padding is there as well okay and if we could do we'll go ahead and do the exact same thing but for the right side so let's go ahead and say a right side underscore side and over here you can see that the inner elements of our side tag are actually div text so we can say all div tags that are children of the right side well what do we want to do with those let's give those a border of two pixels blue well let's say solid blue and we'll go ahead and you know what we won't have to worry about a margin but we'll give them a padding as well of ten pixels and the reason why it's displaying funny is because I didn't put a semicolon in that like I should have so go ahead now and save that and click refresh and yeah we should probably give them a margin on the top on the bottom just to make everything look better so let's do that a margin and for the margin we can go ahead and give this maybe a 10 pixel and a zero pixel and what this means is that there's going to be 10 pixels on the top and on the bottom but zero pixels on the left and the right okay so go back to Firefox click refresh and there we go now you can see that there is a bit of a problem here with the spacing so in fact what I should do is zero pixels so top left bottom 10 pixels and right so let me just make a comment here for anyone that's wondering those measurements are basically the top left bottom and the right okay and what we did was we gave a 10 pixel padding on the margin on the bottom and that's where we get this little spacing over here and I think the last thing that we can do is just go over to our page footer and actually Center that page footer so what I'm going to do is just say text-align:center make sure I spell this right and now that I save that and click refresh you can see the page footer is now in the middle of our web page and that is pretty much all we had to do to create this basic layout now you know I know it doesn't look pretty or anything but that is going to be up to you guys so I've given you guys this template you know that you guys can use but you know if you go and apply any other style rules that you've you learned about in the past and maybe just search some websites you know for basic design or a good design you guys will be able to create a website layout that looks something like this using my code and obviously just apply other style rules to get it the looking good okay so I'm just going to let you guys practice and I want to encourage you guys to practice because the best way you're going to learn how to make stuff that looks good is to obviously just keep practicing and looking at other people's designs okay and that's all I've got for you in this tutorial so don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next
