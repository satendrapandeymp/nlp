in this video we're going to cover the video element that is new in html5 now to follow along with this lecture you're going to need an mp4 file and if you don't have one available just go out to Google and do a search on free mp4 videos and you'll get lots of websites where you can download test videos now the video element in HTML is very similar in terms of its format to the audio elements so you're going to find this structure very similar so as always we need an opening and a closing tag and here is the source element you will remember we talked about that in the audio element HTML lecture well it's the same process here we specify all the different formats for our particular file and again it's the same thing if we can't load the mp4 file we want to go ahead and try and load the dot o GG file now obviously I don't have a dot o GG file because I'm pretty sure the mp4 file will play but again it's the same concept as the HTML audio element now there are three attributes that we need to be concerned with first we want to set a width and height so we use the width attribute first and let's set that to 640 pixels wide and that is sort of a standard specification and then we need to set a pipe and we'll set the height to 360 pixels but again you can set these to whatever you want now similar to the audio element we can also use a controls attribute and that will give us a nice little video player in our web browser so let's go ahead and save this let's load our page up here and there you can see we've got our video player inside of our web browser so let's go ahead and hit play this is a video test to make sure everything is working properly and you can see that it worked okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
