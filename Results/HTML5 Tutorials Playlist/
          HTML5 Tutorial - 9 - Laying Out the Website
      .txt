what's going on guys welcome to your ninth html5 tutorial in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is we're going to be laying out this template that we pretty much made in the tutorials 1 through 4 I think it is so we're pretty much going to lay it out style it and I'm going to show you guys how to lay it out perfectly using an old traditional box model in CSS because I get so many messages and emails asking me how to layout a website and it's even kind of difficult to Center a website properly so I'm going to be showing you the old style and then I'm going to show you how it differs from the new style and you guys can probably use bits and pieces from both to layout your websites like a pro so both of these techniques are awesome I don't want to say that one is better than the other you can definitely use things from both but once you watch probably these next five or six tutorials you guys are going to be able to layout websites like a champ so the last thing I want to mention is yes we are going to be going over you know the canvas and geolocation and all that good stuff but I want to cover the core basic fundamentals first before he's jumping in that really advanced stuff and also I'm going to be moving to New York this weekend so if you're watching these tutorials as I upload them I just want to let you guys know that I'm shutting off my internet tomorrow and it won't be on for like a week or so while I you know transition make the move so anyways enough talking let's go ahead and start laying this stuff out so the very first thing we need to do is we need to surround well I'm going to go ahead and minimize this head we really don't need it we need to surround everything in a huge div tag so I'm going to be putting my div tag right under the body and I'm just going to give it an ID of let me see something I can remember id equals big not bug big underscore rapper in okay since this is right under the very first opening body tag I'm going to close it right under this last one right here and a cool thing if you go ahead and highlight your div tag and if it turns purple that means that it has a matching div tag somewhere so if you're working in a small window like this or if you just want to go through and make sure all your tags match you can do that nice little tip so anyways now that that turned purple again basically we're surrounding our entire main content with this big diff tag and that's so we can Center the website later on so don't forget that and also don't forget the name of it now all I'm going to do is I'm going to go through each one of these tags these html5 tags and give it an ID and an ID basically lets us reference it whenever we're working in the main CSS file later on so I'm going to name this header top header and I probably need that ID and actually I think I'm going to do this just go ahead and copy this bad boy so I don't have to type all that over and over all right so header is top header and then for my nav we need ID for this now the navigation I'm going to just call top menu I guess since that's where all my links are and for this section I'm just going to call it main section pretty creative with that one and let's see we need to find the sides now these side ones right here if you remember they're pretty much the news I'm just going to put news in them Bucky has a dog you know not the important information but definitely information that we do not want to forget so I'm just going to call this side news and for the footer we actually need ID for this too and this is going to be called the footer so let me just go ahead and make sure didn't type anything wrong real quick and if we go ahead and save this in refresh we can see that nothing changes and I guess I might as well show you guys this is our starting point right here Blaine old plain stupid boring website so we definitely need this this up a bit so now that we have an ID on everything whenever we're making our CSS file we can reference this stuff and we can actually move it around how we want to so for this tutorial I just want to mention all that stuff at the beginning and also make sure that you surround all your contents with a big div tag and give all your stuff an ID and that's going to allow us to reference it and also move it around in the next tutorial so we have a lot of CSS and styling to cover in the next tutorial so I'm going to be saving it for then so for now thank you guys for watching and also if you need any of this code again I'm going to be posting it all on my forum so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
