hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number 12 and in this tutorial I am going to show you guys how to use an external style sheet on your web page okay so the first thing we're going to talk about is just what are the advantages of using an external style sheet okay so to do that I'm just going to speak about what we did in the previous tutorial quickly and in the previous tutorial we learned about inline CSS which is where we used styling inside of the tag itself so we had to go ahead and put in a style attribute and then put in some style rules over here as well okay but I showed you guys that this wouldn't really be the best way to use the SS on your web page because this will only change one element and that is the element that the style tag is inside of okay so it would be much better to use an internal style sheet but again an internal style sheet is not really the best way to use CSS because let's say I had one or two or three or 100 websites okay what web pages on my website okay I would then have to go ahead and copy these styling rules over all 100 of those web pages until all of them can look the same or follow the same theme which is really what you want on your website okay that all the pages look very similar okay now of course copying all of that code would get a bit tedious and it means if we ever have to change something we have to go back and change it on all 100 web pages okay so it is much better to use an external style sheet which is what I'm going to show you guys how to do in this video and to start off I'm just going to go ahead and get rid of all of that styling so that our web page basically looks blank again it should look like this if I click refresh yes okay so let's go ahead and make an external stylesheet and then learn how to style that way so I'm going to go ahead and file new and file save as and I'm just going to save this new file as main dot CSS now be sure to save it in the same directory as your index.html file okay if you save it anywhere else then you need to make sure that you've watched my video on directory structures and you understand how to link to a file that's in a different folder okay so for now we've just got this blank main CSS file but let's go ahead and actually add in some styling to this okay so I told you guys before that if we want to select all of the paragraphs on a web page we can just use the selector P and then we put in our two curly braces okay now as you can see the one of the other advantages of using an external stylesheet is that notepad plus plus really helps us out with this kind of thing and it's already letting us know that paragraph or the P that we selected is an element okay so we're selecting by an element name and that is why P turned the same color blue as our elements on our web page okay so let's go ahead and now add in a rule so we'll just go ahead and say color red and as you can see again notepad plus plus is helping us out even further because anything that is a valid CSS property is going to turn this gray color and then anything that's a value that'll stay black as normal okay so right now we've changed all of the colors of our paragraphs to red and let's also change our heading one okay so we'll change the background and color of that to be let's just say yellow again okay but we're not done yet because although we have our styling rules here we have no way of telling HTML okay this webpage needs to look for its styling in this folder or in this file okay so to do that we actually use a link in the head of our webpage so we go ahead and say a link and then we say rel which stands for relationship and over here we just put in stylesheet and then we put in the href okay which is basically the location of where to look for this CSS file and because they're in the same directory I can just go ahead and say main dot CSS and then I'll go ahead and close that off with a slash okay so now when we go back and click refresh you can see we have indeed got our styling appearing on the web page so that is quite awesome indeed okay so just remember guys whenever you want to use an external style sheet don't forget to link to it in the head of your webpage and then also just keep sure I will make sure that you keep to the proper CSS rules which we are going to learn about in the future okay but just to stress this again whenever you are using a CSS or whenever you are trying to change some CSS you're going to use a selector to tell HTML what element you want to change okay so P for paragraphs h1 for h1 tags etc and then the second part inside of these curly braces that is the property so what do you want to change about the tag and then also what the value is that you want to change this property to okay so that's all I have for you guys in this video don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my
