welcome to the sixteenth tutorial on beginning CSS today we're going to look at the line height property and that basically allows you to add space between your lines and so it makes your text more readable so let's go ahead and open up our website and and let's open up the stylesheet first and let's go ahead down to this third class here for our paragraph three we're going to go ahead and get rid of italic and we're going to reduce the pixel size to 15 because it's easier to see how the line height property works with a smaller pixel size so let's go ahead and save this and then I want to show you the HTML two I added some text before the video into the third paragraph so you can go ahead and add some text if you want I just got this off actually Wikipedia what officiais so I wanted a lot of text so it's easier to see how the line height property works okay so let's go ahead and close that out and let's go ahead and open up the web page and we'll just take a look at this and so you can see this is kind of tight here you see how tight that is between the lines so we want to add some space in between all these lines so let's go ahead and do that let's close this out and what we're going to do is when I go down here and we're going to type in line - height as usual we need a semicolon now you can specify this in pixels eeehm or percentage and that's what we talked about in the last video of course so you should know what those are we're going to actually scale this so we'll use the e/m and we're going to go ahead and make that 1.5 and let's go ahead and save this now now let's go ahead and open up our web page and you can see we've got more space now that's a lot more readable than it was without the line height property okay that's basically it it's pretty easy to use you guys can go ahead and play around with the percentage if you want or specify it in pixels and I will see you guys in the next video
