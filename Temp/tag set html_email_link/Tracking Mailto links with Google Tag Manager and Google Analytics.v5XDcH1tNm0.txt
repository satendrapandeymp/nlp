hi there and welcome to another video of GTM training come with me Julian and today we want to talk about how to track mail to links as always these little videos are brought to you by GTM training calm and if you're new to Google tag manager then I would encourage you to check out our free email course and that GTM training.com slash email course you get a little bit of an introduction to Google tag manager now on your website you might have a way for you users to contact you for some it's a form that I have to fill out but for others it's simply an email address and most of the times this email address is actually a link and when you click on it your email program opens up and you'll be able to write an email right away from this link click now let's go back and see how this link is actually marked up we can hover over it and see on the left side bottom of the browser where this link will lead us to and we see here a mail to info at demo shop comm if you want to look into the HTML markup you can right click and in our Chrome browser we can inspect this element which will open up our HTML elements console and we see here it's a normal a href with the link to mail to and the email address and the browser can interpret this and then open up your email program for you now we can't actually know if the user sends you an email because that's all happening in your email program which might be Gmail or Outlook or maybe an application on your phone but what we can do is actually register if somebody clicks on this link and we can use Google tag manager to do this so let's go ahead and implement this let's go over to Google tag manager and the first thing we want to do is open up a generic click trigger let's go over to triggers and click on new and implement a generic click trigger just to know how our click trigger will react to this link click will choose the event which will be a click and since this is a link we can choose in a second option to target just links then we get these two options to wait for tags before the email program opens should our browser pause and wait for our tags to fire we keep the stick and it should wait maximum for two seconds and we also want to check validation so we get a callback from the link that the link was actually clicked to keep this checked go to continue and now we can choose when should we listen for these link clicks since our email is on all pages and the footer will just go with the all pages trigger which is resembled by page URL matches the Reg X dot star which will basically deploy our listener on all the pages as we continue here and then we have the filter option the fire on option that it shouldn't listen to all the link clicks on our page but only to certain link links so we can filter down here since we don't know what to input here we'll just go with all link clicks for now and then later refine our trigger let's create this trigger and go into the preview and debug mode now once we go back to the page and reload our page we get our debug console down here and now I want to click on this link since this link will take us to a new page where the debug console won't be open anymore I will open up this link with the command key pressed in order to open it up in a new tab and then I see here a new event in the data layer which is the GTM link click on so click on this I inspect the data Lia and see what information has been transferred once I clicked this link and this can be used to refine our trigger and here we see that the only really usable information is the element URL which incorporates this mailto link click and the element URL is resembled by the click URL variable that we have not yet available in our variables menu so we have to go back to Google tag manager go on the variables and activate these variables for us just do all the click variables for now and refresh our preview in the bug mode go through the exercise again let's reload our page click on our info at demo shop comm with the command key pressed and go into the GTM link click event then click on variables and now we have them available here and we see all the variables that were filled and the click URL is really unique and we can see that the mail to is included in the click URL and to do an negative test here let's click on this wordpress link and it also opens up a GTM link click but the variables are completely different and the click URL doesn't contain mail too so this is what we can use to actually refine our trigger let's go over to Google tag manager and go back into our generic click trigger and rename that into a trigger that turns true only when we click on a mail to link and now all we need to do is refine our trigger in the fire and options we want to turn this trigger true when somebody clicks on a mail to link so we go with some clicks and choose our variable which was the click URL and it should contain our mail to command and this will be unique only to the links that open actually an email let's save this trigger and the next step would be to actually fire our event to Google Analytics also connected to a tag we'll go with Google Analytics here let's go over to tags click on new name disapprove oddly chooses the product as a tag template Google Analytics and choose as a tag type universal analytics and we already have our tracking ID saved in a variable and a constant variable so you don't have to type it in again and as a track type I choose here event that's what we want to fire into Google Analytics as a category will just import mail toolings and as the action was a click and as the label we actually want to fill this dynamically and know which page the user was on when he clicked it so I choose the page path variable since this is an interaction we want this to affect our bounce rate so keep this at false but if you don't want your link click to affect your bounce rate you can turn this to true let's go and continue and as a firing trigger we'll choose our defined mail to trigger let's save this and create a tank now let's refresh our preview in the back mode go back to our page and click on the info at demo shot comlink again with the command key pressed and we see a new event happening and upon this event the tag fired the Google Analytics event mail to our intended tag which is an event that fires over to Google Analytics in order to do a little bit of a quality check you can go over to Google Analytics into the real-time reporting and under events we should see a new event happen just now with the category mail to the event action click and once we click on it we see click and the event label it happened on the home page so this is working fine and we can publish this to all our users in a new version of the Google tag manager container in order for all our users going forward to be tracked when they click on a mail to link and that's already it with this week's video of GTM
