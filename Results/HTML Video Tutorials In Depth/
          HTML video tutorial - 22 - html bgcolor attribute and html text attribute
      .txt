hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I right-click on the first page dot HTML open with the notepad minimize I right-click the first page dot HTML open with the Firefox I maximize the notepad in the previous tutorial we got information on how we can apply a color to the text in two different ways also we understood how hexadecimal values are interpreted are evaluated behind the scene by the computer we got also some information like if we mix the red color and the green color we get the yellow color as the output we understood that if we mix the red color and the blue color we get the magenta color if we mix the blue color and the green color we get the sine color if all the values are G B R 0 0 0 then the color will be black if red green blue all values are 255 255 255 then we get the white color in this tutorial I am going to discuss how do we apply a background color to our web page file save go to browser refresh you can see that by default the web page color is set to white and if I type some text maybe my text and I say file save go to browser refresh you can see that by default text color is set to black now where this information is stored we should remember that every browser is going to have some style behind the scene if I click on this button in a Firefox click on options you can see here in the content if I click on this content button you will see some default settings default font is set up to Times New Roman and default font size is set to 18 if I click on this colors button you will see default text and background color default background color is white that is the reason you are going to see every web page background color is set to white and the text by default it is going to have a color black if you want you can modify also if I click on this background color and select the red color say okay and if I come to this page you can see that the web page has a background color red let me come back click on the colors button and come back to white and say ok and if I come to a page you can see that the background color is set to white this is a place where you can set the default background color then you can set the default text color also default text color is black let me change this to red say okay and if you go to the web page you can see that the text is displayed in a red color I click on this colors button again I change it back to black say okay now if I come back to web page you can see that default text color is set to black now if I click on the colors button we get some more information here like visited links color should be purple unfitted hyperlinks color should be blue and every hyperlink should be underlined so some default settings you can see here these are actually default Styles applied on every web page if we do not specifically mention the styles in our web page so by default the background color is set to white you can see that right if I want for this specific page I want the background color maybe something else let me click here file save go to browser refresh we don't have any text if I want to apply a background color to a specific page then we will be using an attribute called as BG color BG color is an attribute with respect to the body tag so after this body text before the greater than sign I give a space and write BG C vuelvo or color then we have to give a value in between two double quotations and here you can use the color name or hexadecimal value according to your requirement so if I say here read file save go to browser and refresh you can see that webpage has the background ready color if I want I can give some other color cyan file save go to browser refresh you can see that the background color is set to cyan I can use the hexadecimal values also if I want hash ff0000 this indicates the ready color file save go to browser refresh you can see that the red color is applied maybe I want a gray color then for gray color I write 80 80 80 file save go to browser refresh you can see that the background color is set to gray so this is how you can apply a background color to your web pages that means you are overwriting the default background color for a web page similarly if I write some text hello HTML file save go to browser refresh you can see that it is displayed in the black color if I want to change that if I want to change the default text color for this web page from black to some other color I am going to use an attribute called as text there is an attribute called as text with respect to the body tag so after this double quotation before the greater than sign I give a space and use the attribute called as text equal to in double quotations I give the value maybe red now if I say file you can you should see hello.html is going to be displayed in red color refresh you can see that hello.html is now in red color let me write more content if I write more content file save everything is displayed in the red color can you see that right let me take here I can use the font tag I can increase the font size right so here I can say size equal to six file save go to browser refresh hello HTML is displayed with the size 6 and default text color is we have set to red so the text is displayed in the red I can copy this I can write here a break tag so that I can see the content on the next line control we file save go to browser refresh you can see that both the text are displayed in red color maybe I want to change the color of this hello HTML to yellow then how do we change that we can use the color attribute with the font tag so I am writing here color then I say ye ll o W yellow file save go to browser refresh you can see that this hello.html got displayed in yellow color if I write here again break tag and paste one more content file save as we are not applying any specific color to this hello HTML by default we know that the text color is set to red so this hello HTML is going to be displayed in red color only file save go to browser refresh you can see that it has got displayed in red color if you want to change of course I can use the color attribute with this font tag hope you guys have understood how do we set the background color how do we set the default text color for a web page for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more
