while we touched on parent-child relationships in the previous episode we need to focus a little more specifically on it today so the most adult or the oldest or the ancestor of our page would be the HTML element in an easy way we can tell that is because it is not indented at all so everything else is a child of the HTML element let's view it in terms of the body element of our page notice here how the h1 is not indented but it probably should be now what you'll find is it's not required and a lot of coders preferred not to do it because there's only so much screen real estate available so while you should do this if you have a lot on your page some coders will not do it because it's implied that the body is the parent so note that everything I'm covering today is not required their best practices the h1 element is a child of the body element but what if within the h1 elements I'm going to add a little bit more so I will separate it on its own line and then I will say within a new tag and I'm going to say span this is a simple wrapper and it doesn't have any specific formatting but it allows you to target a specific amount of text so we will take today and wrap it with in here like so when would you ever do this if there is no formatting to span why would you do it and let's say you wanted to write things I must do today but you wanted the word today to be blue and everything else to be black well you need a way then to target just the word today and nothing else so we can do that by using a number of elements but it's common to use a span and that way we can say eventually when you start learning about styling you can say look for the heading one element and then try to see if there's a span element and if there is within it make that value alone meaning this word blue back to our parent-child relationships this span element is now a child of the h1 element and I'm going to zoom in just a touch however the h1 is a child of the body element so think of it as a family tree so this is the oldest and then this person is the html's child and then the h1 is the child of the body the span is a grandchild of the HTML or we don't use grandparent and grandchild we use ancestor and descendant so span is a descendant of the body element h1 is not a descendant of the body technically it is but more appropriately we would say a child it is a direct child at the body because this does not have any parent that is not the body so it's the child of the body this is the descendant of the HTML element the span is a descendant of the HTML the span is a child of the h1 this strong tag right here if it's easier we'll put it on its own line this strong is a child of the paragraph element but it's a strong a child of the h1 element no because note this paragraph is not nested within the h1 tag so the strong is a child of the paragraph tag it is a descendant of the body tag but it has zero relation to the h1 element so that makes the question now what is the relation between the paragraph element to the heading one element like brother and sister they are siblings this h1 has a sibling of the P tag it's also a sibling of the definition list now this might be confusing to you or you might be thinking what does this really serve me and right now at this point it's more important for you to understand that this is a child of this but in the future you will learn that it is vital specifically when you are for example using something like JavaScript to search through your documents it's important to understand relationships so I want you to create just a bit of code anything you want and try to correctly answer the relationship between each one we'll do this last one together before we end for the the definition term is a child of the definition list the definition details are a child of the definition list as well these two are siblings and how do we know for sure they are siblings because this definition details is not nested within the term if it was like that then this in fact would be a child but that would be bad markup so these are siblings to one another the definition list is a sibling to this unordered list this h1 is a descendant of the UL and alternatively the UL is an ancestor of the h1 elements so that's a lot of relationships hopefully that's stuck if not go back and watch it and then try to figure out these on your own today
