what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 46th XHTML and CSS sorrow and this my friends is it tutorial that all of you guys have been waiting for in this lesson I'm finally going to teach you guys how to take your website that you've been working on in your own you know maybe your bedroom or maybe at school and I'm going to teach you guys how to publish it on the World Wide Web so finally we are going global with this baby taking it out and making it so the entire world can see our creation so let's go ahead enough of me talking let's go ahead and get started so go ahead and open google.com and the first thing we need to do is we need to find something called a web host or a web server so in order for everyone to have access to our website we just can't keep it on our computer because I mean I would hope no one else has access to your computer because if everyone in the world has access to that little dinky computer in your room then it would blow up in like three seconds so we need to take those web files and put them on something called a web server now a web server is kind of different than a regular desktop it is basically a computer or in other words a chunk of memory on the Internet a chunk of memory that you can pull web files on and everyone in the world has access to them so then if you put your web files on your computer no one else can see them besides you if you put your web files on a web server everyone in the world can see them so that is how websites are created you put them on special computers card web servers and the entire public has access to them so in order to find a good cheap company we have of course go to Google cheap web hosting not hop sting hosting go ahead and press enter and just click the first link that comes up and these companies are changing all the time so it's good to get a review of which ones are the best but anyways like Hostgator I use that before that's a good one in motion that's a good one to hostmonster that's one I'm using right now that's a good one as well but anyways here are a huge list of companies that offer really cheap web hosting for example it could be as low as like you know books a month to host the website so for example go ahead and go to one of these companies I'm going to go ahead and use hostmonster because I actually bought a domain a long time ago slacker room calm and you know I never used it or anything I just bought it when I was being stupid I was younger and anyways the process is this you go to one of these websites and you type in first of all you got to go ahead and click get started or something and you go ahead and you type in what website you want and most of the time they're already taken but go ahead and type them like Tom's chatroom calm or Dave's blog com whatever you want give me your credit card information and bam you own the website that is your domain name no one else can have it of course you can't like by MySpace or anything com so anyways so now you own the website in your back at this location right here what the heck are you supposed to do from here well from here they give you a place to log into your account and of course they give you your domain name right here and a password that you would have chosen whenever you first bought the account so I'm going to enter my password right there and I'm going to go ahead and log in and once you log in they take you to this thing called cPanel now cPanel is where you manage everything that can go on with your website now like a 99% of these things you will never click most of this stuff is for web programming if you want to buy more stuff email accounts but we're focusing on is something called FTP now FTP is the process it's called File Transfer Protocol and your button might be a little different but my button is right here unlimited FTP so go ahead and click that and a program is going to open up that looks a lot like this there are a bunch of different FTB programs but this one is probably the most popular and the concept is this this is your computer right here and this is the web server and what we need to do is we need to take the files from over on our computer and transfer them to the web server now we just can't start clicking buttons we need to do this in a very specific way now the file is that the public has access to are going to be stored in a folder called public HTML and check it out if you double click that you already have a bunch of files in there by default probably these are pretty much the error files and they might have gave you a default on HTML file so let's go ahead and go to slack room comm and check it out see this is the default home page they give you because you know you bought the website they just wanted to give you something to stick up there make it buy a bunch of ads but what we want to do is we want to put our home page that we made on this domain because we paid good money for it so let's get our documents on there so anyways all of your files are going to go in this public HTML folder so how do you move your files from your computer over to there or first of all go ahead and where did you store your files minor on my desktop in a folder called all extinct all XHTML and again another thing I want to point out is make sure that your file is named index.html by default whenever a browser goes to the website they're going to scroll through this public HTML folder and they're going to look for a file that says index.html that's why it was so crucial to name it index.html if there's no index.html file then it's going to say you know website does not exist or something like that so make sure that you have at least one web page named index.html this is going to be your home page so anyways all you have to do is select that index.html file and press this upload selected files button or the right button this transfers the file from your computer to the web server and now your file check it out is on the web server so pretty much move it from your computer to the web server easy enough so now once you go ahead and go to slack room comm let me refresh this oh yeah that's my website baby oMG I am live on the internet so this is actually a real website that I just want to now anyone in the Roewe world can go to slack room com press ENTER and check it out my website pops up and again I only uploaded a one web page but that is how you upload entire websites to the web server so it's pretty simple and then again anytime you want to update your website just go ahead in your text editor um change your index.html file and then come back in here upload it again it says do you want to overwrite it yes it uploads it again and it would be changed so anyways that is the basics of how you take a website that you created on your computer and upload it so the world can see again a couple of these things might be different um there are different types of C panels different versions this FTP right here um this is the most common one but they're different type of FTPS but they're all basically the same that's the main concept behind the entire Internet putting files on web servers so everyone has access to it so anyways that's all I have for you guys for now and that basically sums up web development in all the basics that we need to cover so maybe I'll make like an example website but for the most part you guys now know how to make a basic website and publish it on the Internet pretty cool huh so you know if you watch all these tutorials it only took a couple hours and look how much you learned so from now or from here rather I would recommend that you learn a language called JavaScript javascript is how you make webpages smarter more interactive more fun or what I would recommend is learning a language called PHP if you want to build games and social networking sites then PHP is an awesome start but for now again I want to thank you guys so much for sticking with me in these tutorials you have no idea how much these views means me I love making these tutorials so lastly thank you guys so much for watching thank you guys for subscribing and yeah I'll see you guys hopefully in future tutorials
