how's it going gasp into a first project using HTML and CSS now today we're going to go and build an actual website or these part of an actual website just to give you guys an idea about how we put together the pages that we have inside a website now we're going to do is we're going to go and take all the previous lessons that we learned so far and sort of combine them into this project here so we can actually learn how to use all the things that we learned in the previous episodes so as you guys can see in front of me here I have a basic design which I build inside Adobe experience this time which is a software from Adobe and if you guys want to download this image you can just go ahead and download it in the description if you wish to have it I do have a patreon page we can get all the lesson material for the episodes that I put up here and again if you don't want to get access to the what you call the lesson material you can just go ahead and use whatever images or videos or whatever you might have to replace what I'm using this episode here okay so we're gonna go and pick this design here and as you may notice we do have a desktop design and we have a mobile design now just for the sake of this exercise I'm not gonna build the entire mobile design together with you guys because it's gonna be a really really long episode if I have to build everything that you guys see in front of me here so what we're gonna focus on is we're gonna focus on the front page we're gonna build the desktop version and the mobile version and then we're just gonna go ahead and build the regular pages of the other two sub pages here what you may notice if I just go and zoom in so you guys can actually see what we're gonna build today is that we have a basic front page that is not too complicated I came out with this design a while back when I was preparing for this episode it's not advanced but it's it's just a really good simple design for us to you know do in this episode so what we have here is a basic header with a navigation and a logo in it and a link up here at least two cases and underneath the banner you guys can see that we also have a couple links that will lead to two different sub pages now we're not gonna insert any sort of background images inside these links here because I just didn't have the time to to get a bunch of images ready for the background images again you don't have - if you don't want to it's really up to you because it's your design and at the bottom here we have a footer now inside my sub pages we have a cases page where you can go ahead and see all the different cases that you might have made let's say you made a couple of websites or video products or maybe your photographer and you want to show off your your portfolio then you can go ahead and show them off inside the cases page and then underneath it we have a contact link where we have you know phone number and email address then if we were to actually click one of these pages we get taken into a case page we can see whatever project you might have made in in my case I have a video that I have inside my root folder that we're going to show inside my sub page here and then a short description down here okay now again this design here is not something that I took online so if you guys want to and you want to have this design and build a portfolio based off my design here just go ahead and grab it and copy it as much as you want I'm not going to you know say that this is my design so just you know do whatever you want with it and build your own website if you if you feel like it okay so we're just gonna go ahead and before we go into the code just take a look at the mobile design because I did mention in the responsive design episode for this course here that we should always design for mobile first meaning that when we start designing and programming this website need to focus on the mobile version first and then we're going to expand using responsive design inside the CSS file using media queries we're gonna go and expand out to the desktop version and what you guys may also see is that I did not focus on a tablet version so we're not gonna build a tablet version for this website even though you should probably do it because there's quite a jump from mobile to desktop design-wise so we're just gonna go and get started on this design here now one thing I want to do before we start coding anything is just to show you guys what I have so far because I have just a little bit such as the video that we're gonna use inside the case page the images that I'm gonna use you know just that sort of thing and also want to mention that the menu here does have a slight difference from the desktop version to the mobile versions so maybe we should actually focus on the desktop version when it comes to making the the navigation up here so just mentioning that before we get started so I'm just going to go ahead and jump inside the would you call decoding files and as you guys may see is that I have an index page and I have a style sheet ready now there's nothing inside the styluses besides reset style code which is something you can just download from the internet which again I do have an episode showing how to get reset styling inside your documents so this is just basically to reset the browser to make sure that the website doesn't look different in different browsers because browsers do have different stylings applied to them as a default okay so at the bottom here we're going to go ahead and include our code once we do actually get to it so what we're going to do now is we're just gonna basically go and set our design and we're gonna focus on the mobile version first now as you may notice the navigation for the mobile version is not the is not to use the one you see on mobile websites we have to click a button and then it opens up a menu because that would make more sense since it's a mobile version but because we haven't talked about JavaScript OTA Korea any other coding languages we're just gonna make a basic navigation with buttons in it and this navigation should then follow as we scroll down so it doesn't go away and we have to go all the way to the top again to to click any links okay so it's just going to be a basic HTML attempt on a on a mobile pretty called menu so we're gonna go and go inside our code sheet or inside our index page and we're gonna go ahead and start creating this a header that we have at the top here so we're just gonna take it from the top to bottom one at a time so I'm gonna go and go inside my body tags and I'm just going to go and start creating the necessary tags for the different section of the front page so I'm gonna go ahead and say we have first of all a header tag because I do have a head inside the website then we have a main tag which we use in order to include main content of a website and at the bottom here I'm gonna go and include a footer tag so what we're going to go and do is inside the header I'm gonna go and create our logo because we do have a logan's at the website I called mine mmm toots and you can call whatever you want to you can call something that you want to call it I just decided for a mint touch because that's the name of you too channel so I'm gonna go and stop my design here and again because we want to at least for the header here focus on the desktop version I'm just gonna go ahead and go back up to the desktop version because you guys can see we do have a bar we have another link over here so I'm just gonna go ahead and stay up here in the desktop version for at least ahead of here so we're gonna go ahead and just take a look at it we can see we have a white background inside a bar that goes all the way across and we also have a logo we have a navigation and then a link over here in the right side so that's what we need to make inside our code seat and I did use different fonts as you may notice decent nuts some of the default like Arial or Times New Roman god forbid you actually use that one so I did actually include a font inside my head tag up here which I just got from google fonts in my example I am using catamaran and I'm using cor cormorants Garamond pretty hard to pronounce those names at least for me so inside my header here I'm just gonna go ahead and start building what we have inside the website so the first thing was a logo so I'm gonna code and say we have a paragraph tag notice I did not use an eight tag because this is not really a header it's just a local name and I'm gonna go and write em in suits and maybe this would actually be a link because I do want to be able to click this logo and go back to the front page so let's actually go and change it from a paragraph to a anchor tag instead let's actually go ahead and link it directly back to the front page immediately so we're gonna include a hyper reference and I'm just gonna set this one to index dot HTML there we go whoops on too many and underneath the logo I'm gonna go and include the navigation so we're gonna go ahead and say we have a nav tag inside HTML which means that we're starting in navigation and inside the nav tag we're gonna create an unordered list because we have we need to have the list items of the menu going to create a list item and inside the list item I'm gonna create a link I'm just gonna go ahead and do like this and inside the link we're gonna go ahead and say we have a let's say what do you actually have inside our example here we do have a portfolio then about me and then contacts so we're going to say portfolio portfolio then I'm gonna copy it paste underneath here two more times because we had three links inside the navigation the second one is gonna be about me and the last one is going to be contacts and again you can change these links if you want to you don't have to follow exactly what I'm doing here now I just want to mention my my keyboard is actually right underneath the microphone so I have a bit of a hard time looking at the kibo well I'm typing so if I make typos is because I can't see my keyboard inside the link so we're gonna go and change the link from hashtag because that's the placeholder we don't have a link yet I'm gonna change it from hashtag to portfolio that HTML in the first one then I'm gonna go down to about me and change it to about dot HTML and again you don't have to name it specifically this you can change it to something that you want to name it if you want the file to look different just go ahead and avoid using multiple words inside the document because it's not really something that I think looks nice you could do it but I don't think it looks nice okay so there we go and what we need to do now is we need to go ahead and include the rest of the navigation inside the HTML not the navigation but we do also have a link on the right side of our header so I'm just gonna go and include that now that is just going to be a link because this basically just links inside our cases page so I'm just gonna go ahead and say that we have a basic link because it's not a list it's just an individual link by itself and I'm gonna go ahead and say we have cases then I'm gonna link to a cases HTML like so now one more thing we're gonna go and do inside the index page before so it's styling anything is I'm gonna go and include a class to the different anchor tags to the heaven here at least the ones not inside the navigation because we need to be able to style this specific link up here differently then this link down here and we can only do that by adding a class to it so we're gonna go and say we have a class and the first one set to we can call something like header as brands because this is a logo which is the brand the website and we can go down to the anger tech down here give it a class set to hitter and - cases again you could name this cases - link or something I'm just gonna go to naming like this so now that we have this you guys can go ahead and see that we do have some things going on inside the website now the next thing we want to do is we want to style the navigation or at least a header section before we continue to the next part not because we have to but because I would like to show you guys what we've done so far so now we need to start focusing on designing for mobile first okay when I said we had to focus on a desktop version for the design I just meant that we had to include all the HTML elements that needed to be included inside the desktop version before we start doing anything down here so now we have all the HTML tags that we need to have so we can go ahead and focus on design when it comes to the mobile version and again if you want to create a mobile version we right click inside the browser inspect the website and then we go out to this little tap up here that says toggle device toolbar we click it and then you can see we can change the from responsive to iPhone let's go ahead and say iPhone 7 I think our teens that used to be iPhone 6 so now we can actually see a mobile version we can actually start designing for it so I'm gonna go ahead and go inside my style sheet and I'm gonna go in first of all create the little what you called the header background up here which is white so I'm gonna go and go inside my style sheet and what you're gonna go to notice here is that I do have some styling in here as a default but this is only reset styling this is not something that I programmed this is just you know you can download research styling from the internet if you want to just to reset all the different styles to have as a default inside the different browsers and again I do have an episode inside my core C where I explained how to do this so this should not be anything new to you guys so at the bottom here I'm gonna go and include my code and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna go and give my website a background color so I can actually see when I add a white background to our header otherwise we can't see it so I'm going to say we have a body curly brackets gonna set the body to backgrounds - color set to a slightly gray colors I'm just gonna say hashtag f3f3f3 which should be good enough and then I'm gonna go and go underneath the body tag I'm gonna go and say we have a header styling they want to apply I'm gonna set this one as a background - color set to white which is FFF gonna give it a width because it needs to go all the way from left to right so we're gonna say with on the percents and we're going to give it a height set to 100 pixels now I do also want to point out that we need to include the meta viewport inside our head tag because although us is not going to apply to what he called the responsive design as it should so you need to include this line of code inside your head tag okay inside our stylesheet I'm gonna go ahead and start styling the the brand that we have inside the header which is the logo so I'm going to go underneath the header here say if you have a header and inside the header we have a class called header - brands curly brackets I'm gonna go and start by just styling the the fonts for this specific logo so I'm gonna give it a font - family set to care tear Moran if that is spelled correctly I'm gonna set a font size to 24 pixels I'm gonna give it a color set to not completely black but 1 1 1 because completely black I don't know for some reason it doesn't look quite it sort of hurts your eyes inside websites if it's not because you have a very specific reason to use completely black so it's just my personal preference not to use completely black unless it's like a background or something okay so I'm gonna go and use 1 1 1 and I'm gonna go and give this a font weight as well because I do think we have a slightly bold text in here so I'm gonna save fonts - wait I'm gonna set it to 900 if that is not too thick and I'm gonna go and see what we have so far inside the websites I'm just gonna go and refresh and as you guys can see we now have some going on now right now we also need to make the text uppercase and we can do that using two ways either we can go inside our index page and just rewrite mmm toots and capitalize letters or I can do the other option if I want to change it later and I don't have to mess around with the the the actual index page I can go out and make a styling cold text - transform and set it to uppercase save it and you may notice there was also a underline underneath all the links inside the website and I want to get rid of that so instead of just getting rid of it inside the styling here I'm actually going to remove it from all links inside the website so I'm going to go at the top here say we have a multiplication symbol which means that we're styling everything inside the website using their specific styling and I'm gonna set a text - decoration set to none okay so now who were to go back inside the website refresh the browser you guys can see that now we have something that looks a bit more like the design now as you may notice we also need to Center the link inside the mobile version so if you go back inside the style sheet and go underneath here we can go ahead and say we want to first well display our link as a block element and the reason we do this is because when it comes to links I like to make them into a block element because it becomes easier to style it afterwards okay so we make it into a block and then we go ahead and say we want to send to the block by using margin:0 auto and we also want to set a text - align set to center if we go ahead and refresh the browser you guys can see that now we have a centered link inside the browser here inside the the mobile version of the website so I also want to create some distance from the top because it's touching the top and I do not want to have that so if we were to just go and create just as slides spacing at the top of the website we can go ahead and say we want to either create a margin or padding in this case I'm just gonna go and include a padding - top actually let's go ahead and add a padding to top and bottom so we're just gonna say padding because we also want spacing from the navigation once what you actually get to that one so I'm gonna say pad set it to 20 pixels from the top and bottom and serial pixels from left and right refresh the browser and as you guys can see we now have some spacing going on so the next thing we need to do now is we need to style the navigation so we're going to go inside our style sheet and say that we have a header with a nav tag inside of it with a unordered list inside of it curly brackets then I'm just going to go ahead and copy paste and say if you have a list item inside the unordered list gonna copy paste again and say we have a link inside the list item so now can actually start all three different parts of the navigation here so what we can do now is we can go ahead and just go ahead and copy some of the text that we have up here so I'm the styling because we need to have a font when you said of color you type different things going on here so I'm just going to copy them and paste them inside the navigation link down here now also want to display the links next to each other so I'm going to go up inside my list item up here and I'm gonna code and include two pieces of code well three pieces of code I'm gonna first of all have a display set to inline - block then I'm gonna go ahead and say well it's actually good and correct that spelling mistake then I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a float set to left and you might be asking well man including a float because technically the entire blog is going to set them next to each other so we don't really need the float but the reason I'm doing this is because if you don't use float then there's gonna be a slight gap between the links and I want to get rid of that using float okay after float we need to include a list style because I do not want to have bullet points if would you actually have it inside the browser so it's actually just going to remove them so I'm gonna set it to none let's go out and refresh the browser and as you guys can see we now have two links next to each other now we don't want to have the what you call to fund weight here so I'm just gonna go ahead and remove the font weight because that is way too much thickness for the font there we go and I also want to change the font size because it's not gonna be the same size as the logo up here so I'm just gonna go and check what I had inside the sign it was set to 16 pixels so I'm gonna cut and set this one to 16 as well there we go and I also want to go ahead and remove our link that we have over here called cases from the mobile version so we're just gonna go ahead and go inside our code and say that we have a header with a class called header - cases because that's what we named it and I'm gonna set this one to a display:none so it's not gonna display itself inside the website when we have to styling apply it to it like so so now we need to censor the navigation and we need to create some spacing in between the links so I'm gonna go and say we have our let's go ahead and actually style the list item that's I couldn't start a list item because if it were to style the anchor tag then we will have a clickable area in between the links and I don't think that's a good idea for the mobile version so let's actually just go ahead and stick with the list item up here and create some spacing using this one so I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a heading set to zero pixels from top and bottom and maybe I don't know 16 pixels from left and right save it refresh the browser and now we have some spacing going on now we want to Center it so I'm gonna go ahead and say we have our unordered list up here because that is the entire vacation that we're styling so I'm gonna set this one to a margin:0 auto save it and refresh and nothing happened that's because we need to add a display:block so we're just gonna continue that again if you can't Center things just go in a display:block to it and then you can see if it if it works now if we were to go inside the browser none refresh it you guys will actually notice that we do not have centered the navigation yet and that's because right now the navigation at least unordered list is going to be 100% width of the headers inside of so it's actually gonna go all the way from left to right meaning that if it's going to censor itself then technically it is technically centered inside the header so we need to change the width of the honor to make it fit the constant inside itself so we're gonna go and go inside our code and we're gonna go ahead and add a width and set it to fits - content gonna go inside the browser and refresh it and now you guys will see that we do have a navigation that has been centered so now we have two navigation pills so let's actually go in focus on the rest of the website if I were to go ahead and go inside my design you guys can see that right now we have a banner with some text inside of it so I'm just gonna go ahead and go inside my code again inside my index page and inside the main tag that we have down here I'm gonna go and include a banner now do notice that we have text on top of the banner so we need to insert not of image but a background image we do that by adding a div or in this case we could actually technically include a section because this is a section with similar content inside of it so we're going to say section and inside the section here I'm going to include the text that we need to insert inside the banner so were to take a look at our design here you guys may see that we do have a header that says I'm a freelance web developer and then we have another text underneath here which if we have to take a look at this at a optimization wise look I do think there's more text down here that is relevant when it comes to what people might search for inside Google so I'm going to insert the bottom text as an h1 tag and the top text as an h2 tag okay so I'm going to go inside my section here and say we have an h2 tag and underneath here that we have a h1 tag then I'm just going to go and copy the text so I'm gonna say I am a freelance web developer paste it in I'm gonna go inside and copy the other text that we have here and paste it in like so again if your text is going outside the screen here you can access scroll to the right side know that you can go up inside view and say tacos soft rap which makes the text go down to next line instead of just continuing out to right side of the screen here okay so just gonna go ahead and because I do actually have a new line inside the text here I do want developer to go down to a new line and the way you can do that is by including a break so I'm just gonna say we have a br tag like so which means that it's gonna go to the next line so now that we have this we can actually go ahead and insert a background color inside the section tag so I'm gonna go inside my stylesheet and inside my start seed I'm just gonna go and go underneath our head of styling because we have a new section here we could actually make a comment for ourselves saying that index so you can see this is the index page and what we can do down here is we can go ahead and say we have a well we should probably not just style all the sections we should probably include a class to it so I'm gonna say class is going to be equal to index - banner and again all the sections are gonna have index - something as a name because it makes sense so we know that this is styling for inside the index page okay I'm gonna save it go inside my code and I'm gonna go and say we have a class called index - banner then I'm gonna go and give it a width set to hundred percent and when it comes to the height I wanted to be an entire height of the website - the header that we have in here now the way we do that is we're just gonna go and write height and then I'm gonna go and include something called a hundred v8 which is the view height so the device was sitting on it's gonna be a hundred percent of the device height okay so we're gonna say a hundred view height now you hadn't view width is actually a new thing you have inside CSS so I'm really glad that we have it now because it makes things quite a lot easier when it comes to making things entire entire height of a browser now it's going to be a problem here because if we were to go ahead and save this actually let's go ahead and add the background image so you guys can probably see it when would you actually need to refresh the browser so I'm gonna say we have a background - not color but image and I'm gonna set a URL parenthesis semicolon and what I have inside my root folder here so do you actually have an image folder for the image that I'm gonna use in this example here so I'm gonna take the banner jpg and just sort of link to that one so I'm gonna say we have single quotes we have a MT folder and inside the ng folder I'm gonna say we have a banner dot JPEG like so I'm just gonna go ahead and add the necessary background image styling so I'm gonna say we have the background - repeats set - no repeats gonna set a background position and again there's some of these popping up here so we can actually just choose one of them so we can say background position set it to Center then we can say background sighs I'm just gonna choose one from the list here set it to cover which means that it's just going to cover it inside banner no matter to hide in the width so it's always going to fit inside the container okay so now that we have this we can actually go ahead and see what happens inside our browser here so I'm just gonna go and refresh and as you guys can see we now have a background image now the thing that I want to point out here is that we did set it to a hundred view height meaning that it's going to be a hundred percent of the view height but do also have a header up here which actually pushes it down meaning that if I were to scroll we do have our image just going slightly below you know what we can actually see inside the website when we enter it for the first time and I want to get rid of that so we need to rule part of the bottom of the banner here now the way we can do that is actually with a new thing we have inside CSS which is also a really cool feature which is if I were to go inside the height here we can actually calculate a new height that it should have now we know that the header has a hundred pixels in height so we can actually go and set our height calculation inside the image banner and say that we want to help which means calculate and we want to calculate something inside the parentheses here so I'm just going to delete the hundred view height and say I want to calculate 100 view height mine is a hundred pixels because that was the height of the header so I'm gonna go inside the browser and I'm just going to go ahead and refresh and as you guys may notice I cannot scroll down any further because we have nothing going down below the view of the website here when we entered on a cell phone so this is how we can get rid of this sort of thing which i think is really nice I really enjoy that we have the calc feature inside CSS now because that used to be a huge problem when we wanted to calculate something specific inside the website so it really helps to have this feature inside CSS so now I want to do is we want to style the text up here so I'm just going to go ahead and say that we have our index - banner and inside of it we have an h2 tag so I'm going to set curly brackets and I'm just going to go and check out what we have for the styling inside the h2 we have 60 pixels using a font that I'm not going to use so I'm just gonna switch to the catamaran that I linked to but we know it has to be 60 pixels and it has to be a bold weight so go inside our code here and I'm just going to go to cut paste what we have up here because that's a lot easier and I'm just gonna paste it down and I'm gonna change the color to white gonna change it from 16 to 60 pixels in size and I'm gonna go ahead and center the text so I'm gonna say text - align center like so gonna go inside the browser refresh and now I guys can see we have some text going on now I do also need to include a weight because I wanted to be a slightly thicker so I'm gonna say font - wait set it to 900 and just check out how it looks like so it does look quite good I think now we could also add a text shadow because it makes it stand out a bit more because you may notice that some of the background is actually white and for example here with the a we can't quite see what's going on there so I'm just gonna go back inside my styling say we have a text - shadow and set it to let's start with two pixels two pixels and a color set to 1 1 1 refresh the browser and as you may notice we now have a text shadow now do you think I want to add a blur to the shadow so I'm just gonna go back inside my stylesheet because it's it's a bit too much when it's not blurred out so I'm just gonna go and add a third parameter right before the color and set it to maybe 8 pixels of blur inside the text shadow and there we have it okay it could also make it a slightly less dark color if we wanted to but I'm just gonna going to stick with this one for now now I want to create this tiling for the bottom text and then afterwards you're going to create the spacing from the 82 and the top part here so I'm just gonna go inside my design here and as you guys can see we have the second font tab with just a cormorant Garamond which is 28 pixels and it's the light it's helic font the styling so I'm just gonna go and apply that to this font here so I'm gonna save copy/paste change it from h2 to h1 change it to or was it just gonna go inside my index page here and copy the font name there we go because there's a lot ease and just simply guessing and writing it out I'm gonna go and delete the plus symbol so we have cormorant Garamond and I'm gonna change the font to was it 24 pixels 28 pixels there we go and I'm gonna set the font weight not to 900 but maybe just a hundred cuz that makes sense I'm gonna go and keep the text shadow for now because we might need to have that and we also need to make it italic so I'm going to add a font - style set it to italic save it refers to browser and now we have something that looks quite good now we're gonna go and create some spacing between the different paragraphs we have here so it looks somewhat decent I do also think we need to do something about the line height because it's a little bit too tight together and as you guys can see in here there's a bit well if you guys can can see it there's a bit more space in between the line so I'm just gonna go and include that as well so we're gonna say we have a line - height let's go ahead and set this one to let's say 34 pixels again I'm just sort of spitballing here so we need to to see if we need to increase it and we do actually need to do that so I'm just gonna set it to 40 pixels refresh and we do have something that looks a lot better I'm also going to go and include a bit of space in between the title up here the what you called h2 tag so I'm gonna just go and copy the line height paste it up here and I'm gonna change it to something above 60 pixels so I'm gonna go and set it to 70 pixels I guess just gonna go ahead and refresh the browser and check it and yeah that looks just about good so now I want to Center the text inside the view here and we do have a special technique Oh can do this which is not something that we learned about yet because if I were to just go ahead and give it a margin or padding from the top to push down the text and then if I'm inside different device that has another recall device Heights then it's going to mess up the alignment and it's not going to be centered so we need to add a small trick to it here and the way we do that is by wrapping our text inside a box inside our index page so I'm just gonna scroll down to the text and I'm just gonna create a div for this one just gonna go an insert the text inside the div and this div here is going to be a container that we're going to Center inside index - banner which means that since we're centering this container here then all the text inside is going to be centered as well when it comes to the vertical view of the browser so I'm gonna give this one a class set - let's go and call something like vertical - Center just to give it a name I'm gonna go ahead and copy it here go inside my style seed and right after the index - banner just go in soda here so what I'm going to do now something we haven't talked about yet which is I'm going to go ahead and make our in expander into a table and then I'm going to make our container down here with the text inside of it into a cell and by doing this I can then Center the cell inside the table and again it's not something we learned yet so I'm just gonna sort of show you guys what we need to do in order to do this so I have the index banner up here which I'm going to give a display set to table and I'm gonna go and give our container down here a display set to table cell vertical align it to a middle styling and then I'm gonna go and go inside my website here and then refresh and as you guys can see we now Center the text inside the browser now again we're not gonna go too much into the technical things about how we censored it because we will have a episode coming up very soon about table cells which should explain what we did here so just go ahead and use this trick here for now and then the future if you want to can also use it for future projects if you wish to so now we have this part done and we just need to include the the bottom section if you go down into the design you guys can see we have the different links that need to be displayed one by one and of course we need to have the footer at the bottom here so let's go and create this section over here now so if we go inside our index page so we can go down inside our main section below our section called index - banner and we're going to create a different section because now we have a different section tada so what we're gonna go and do is we're gonna go and insert all different boxes that we need to link to other pages inside the website again we're not gonna create all these pages but just to show you guys that you can include them if you want to we're going to include all these boxes in here that's going to link okay so we're going to take cases portfolium to youtube channel about a contact and make these boxes inside the index page here and I think that was about six of them so after you create the first dip box we're going to copy it five more times okay so we're gonna say we have a div and I'm gonna code and give this one a class now there's easy way to style these when we have this many after each other that are similar but we haven't talked about this yet inside CSS so I'm just gonna not talk about it because it might be too confusing and just going to stick with what we know so far so we're just gonna go and stick with classes here okay now we're gonna go and give this one a class as index - and again I'm gonna be really uncreated here and call it box link - one which is a really bad name but again it gets the point across and I'm going to go inside this box here and add a h3 tag now the first one was cases then portfolio then mm toots so that's actually going to start with that one so we have cases and I'm just gonna go ahead and copy paste five more times I did not count there I think there's six and I'm gonna go and change the class names to two three four five and six then I'm gonna change the name so we're gonna say mm toots and I did already forget what we had here it was actually portfolio and mantoots youtube channel just gonna copy paste it down here port folio mmm toots youtube channel what's the next one the next one was about and contact and context so now we have all the different boxes inside our index page that's actually good and style them so I'm gonna go and copy the first link up here which was well not link for class and I'm gonna go ahead and go down at the bottom of my stylesheet paste it in as a class and then curly brackets now before we do anything in here I do want to show you guys that I do have some spacing from the sides of the device so we're viewing it in and the button here so we do need to have some white space around it and we do that well at least we could do it by saying that first of all we have a margin set to May be twenty pixels I'm not entirely sure how much space that is let's ask consent to 10 pixels because 20 might be too much and I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a width which is going to be calc because we need to calculate now and it's going to be a hundred percent minus 20 pixels because we have 10 pixels from each side of the the box so it goes up to 20 pixels in total I'm gonna go ahead and give it a height and set the height to something like let's actually go ahead and check what I didn't set the design here I just set it to a hundred pixels which for some reason makes sense let's go ahead and try it out and I'm gonna go and set a background color to what did I did I give it I gave it a f2 f2 f2 which is a very light grey colors we're gonna say hashtag f2 f2 f2 and I'm just gonna go ahead and move the background color from our body tag because otherwise we can't actually see what is going on here if I can find it up here because it has a very similar background color as what you call the boxes we're creating now so we won't actually be able to see them if we still have a great background color for the body I'm just gonna delete it and now what we can do is we can actually go and check out what we have so far so I'm gonna refresh scroll down and as you can see we now have some space and going around the box here now I do want to have a bit more spacing because I don't think that is quite enough so I'm just gonna go inside my stylesheet again and I'm gonna couldn't give it a margin set to 20 pixels because that might actually be better gonna chance it in here to 40 pixels inside to calculate refresh the browser and there we have it that might actually be a bit too much also so let's actually go and change that again to 16 pixels 16 plus 16 is 32 and there we go much better now we also need to have some spacing in between the different buttons here and what we need to do in order to do this is we need to change the Martin up here slightly because right now if you were to actually have the boxes showing one by one inside the browser there's going to be a huge gap in between the buttons and not a lot of space from the top of the first button so we need to go ahead and say we want to change the what you called the margin at the top and bottom to 16 pixels from the top 16 pixels from the left and right and zero pixels from the bottom we've just write zero now before we continue there's one thing I want to mention which is something I realized that you guys may notice which is the right now it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to give all the different boxes here a different class name because we need to apply the same styling to all the boxes so why do we even do this well it makes sense because once we do go inside our designer gasps can see that the desktop version does not have the same sized boxes as we do down inside the mobile version so when it comes to the desktop version we need to have a way to differentiate these two types of boxes that we have inside the desktop design now I just realized that we probably do not need to have six different classes to you know to do this with Pro just need to so that's gotten change that if we were to go inside our index page we need to change the first one well we can just keep this one at one would call it square because that might makes sense because if were to go inside the design you can see that we have a square box and then we have a rectangle over here so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy and paste the square to the third one and I do think that if we were to go inside the design it's going to be the last two as well so I'm gonna be six and five and then we can change to number two and number four to rectangle I am not sure if I spelled that correctly and I'm gonna go and do it in this way instead I also just noticed that we forgot to add a class name to this section here so we're just gonna go ahead and copy what we have up here in the top one paste it in like so and changed it from index - banner to index - links or something else so what I can do now is I could technically just go ahead and copy class name of the section go inside my styling here and just go ahead and replace the class name here space div which means that we're starting all the divs inside index links the container here which means that they're now all gonna have the same stylings of words go inside the browser and refresh you guys can see that we now have the same styling applied to all these links here which is a lot easier than what I was just about to show you guys I was about to do it the complicated way and again it's about minimizing our code as much as possible by reusing the code as much as we can okay now when we do come to the desktop version we do need to make some changes but for now let's just go ahead and stick with this one so now we'll need to do is we need to change the link names because they're not styled yet so I'm gonna go inside my CSS file and I'm just gonna go ahead and copy what we have up here inside the index banner h1 paste it underneath here I'm gonna copy our path from the previous styling paste it in space and say that we have a h3 tag because that's what I believe we called it now we're gonna go and change a few things here we want to change the let's see the font weight is I think the font weight should be changed to something like 900 and the font style is not going to be italic we do not want to have cormorant Garamond but instead we want to have catamaran as our font type and I do think we need to change the color to one one one and we could apply a what we do not need to text yet oh and I think that's about it now another trick for you guys if you do not want to add a color to each individual paragraph in h3 tag and so on so on and so on is you could just go ahead and create a styling cold like P curly brackets and then give it a color set to something like has take 1 1 1 so you don't have to redo it all the time when you have to create a paragraph inside your code again I didn't do it in this episode but you should probably do that as a default okay I'm gonna go and save this and see how it looks like that looks almost like I wanted to it needs to be upper case and I do think that the detects is a bit too thick so this actually going to change the back to 100 I'm gonna make it upper case we're gonna say text - transform upper case and we also need to send to the text so I'm going to say we have a line height set to not 40 pixels but instead 100 pixels because the total height of the box that is inside up is 100 pixels okay so I'm gonna go ahead and refresh the browser and there we have it well maybe not quite like that because it's a bit too thin the text I think so let's go back inside the styling and say that we do not want to have let's go with 300 and see what the font weight does to our text not quite enough let's go ahead and say 600 again we're experimenting a little bit here and that looks about right so now we have some links going down here we can actually well we cannot click them yet so we need to do that next so we're going to go inside our index page and we're gonna go and wrap a link around all the different boxes that we have here so I'm gonna say we have a link opening tag and a link closing tag after the div and I'm just gonna reorganize this slightly so it looks a bit better so I'm just gonna go to move up the anchor tag like so move down to the box like so and then move up the constant here like so so it looks a bit more organized than it did before so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy well this actually move all these out like so then I'm gonna go and copy all the anchor tags beginning links inside all these different boxes that we have here now if you hold down ctrl and click you can actually add multiple places at once so you don't need to do it one at a time like so I'm also going to do the same thing for the closing tag so we're just going to go ahead and copy the closing tag go after the div after the div after the div after the div and after the div and just close it here we just need to move it back once like so and now we'll need to change the links here now again we don't really have a lot of these pages so I'm just gonna change to one for cases because this is going to be the only pay to be actually create together inside this project here other than the case page so I'm gonna go and change the link from hashtag to cases dot HTML and now we should have some links going on so we're to go inside the browser refresh you guys can see we can now click them of course you could not find the page because you don't have it yet so now we have this section down hit done and we can get started on the footer section so we're to go inside my stylesheet go to the bottom here we can make another comment saying footer and I'm gonna go and go back inside my index page go to the bottom here right what we have the footer and I'm gonna go and start adding different parts that we need to have inside the the actual website with different content so I'm gonna go inside my design and just take a look at what we need here again I'm gonna go down to the mobile version what you may notice is that we do have a menu and we have a couple of links and if we were to go up inside the desktop version we have two menus so I want to go for what we call it the desktop version and when it comes to the styling then make this second menu disappear just like we did inside the header so I'm just gonna go ahead and say we have two menus inside the folder here so we're going to say we have a unordered list a list item and inside the list item we then have an anchor I'm gonna go ahead and just copy paste this a couple of times I do think we need to do it five more times if I was not mistaken just gonna double check yeah and then we need to do the same thing for the second menu so just gonna copy paste to the unordered list and paste it down now we need to insert home portfolio or was it cases I'm not quite sure cases not portfolio so I'm going to go back in here cases about me and contacts then we need to add something different inside the list item down here which is going to be latest cases and this one does actually not need to be a link because this was actually a title for different menus we have underneath here so I'm just going to remove the link from this one so I'm just gonna say delete delete delete delete and delete then I'm gonna go ahead and say we have the first text down here which could be and again these are just some of the cases that I've been part of throughout my career so I'm just gonna go ahead and copy what I have here you guys can do whatever you want just gonna paste it below here so we don't need to go back and forward all the time gonna copy the first one insert it copy the second one insert it third one insert it and the fourth one insert it then we can just go and delete the text again like so now the next thing I'm going to include here is the images that we have inside the design I do think I have the images inside my nope I do not have the images inside my folder here so I'm just gonna go ahead and grab those first okay so just went ahead and downloaded a Facebook and Twitter and a YouTube icon so we can actually use them and we're gonna code and link to these and insert inside our index page so what I'm gonna do here so I'm first of all just gonna copy the name of one of these I think Facebook actually no YouTube is going to be the first one just gonna copy the entire file path and name and I'm gonna go and go inside my index page and underneath the on our list I'm gonna go ahead and add a dip box that is going to be named footer - links or maybe not links let's make social media so SM then inside the dip box I'm gonna go and include a image actually no let's go out and include a anchor tag because it needs to link somewhere so we're gonna say anchor tag and then inside then get sag we have an image then the source is going to be an image folder forward slash and then the name of the image the alt tag we also need to include because we need to name them at something so we can access a optimize our images which means that Google will actually be able to tell what's inside the images when people search for it so I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is a YouTube logo or icon you could say that as well and I'm gonna go ahead and just copy this image tag two more times like so and change the name of them so I'm just gonna go back inside my folder and get the second one which is going to be Facebook I guess I actually know I think that's going to be the last one down here so we're just going to go ahead and paste it in here then I'm gonna get Twitter and paste it in as the second one like so now would you also need to close the anchor tag around each link because that does not make sense if everything links to the same thing of course there we go and there we go if you have any kind of social media then you can just go and include the link for them directly inside the the hash tag so if I were to go to my youtube channel I could just copy the URL insert it inside and set the hash tag and then this would actually link to your social media I'm not gonna do that here because it takes too long to get all the different links just gonna go and keep it at this for now so now we have everything we need to have inside our index page in order to actually have a full index page inside the browser and we just need to style it so I'm gonna go inside my style sheet and go to the bottom where we have the footer and say we have a footer tag curly brackets set a width to 100% and set the height to something like actually let's not set a height let's set a padding top and bottom instead which means that it's always gonna be flexible regarding the height depending on how much content is inside the footer which makes it self adjust which is nice so just gonna go ahead and set a padding instead gonna set a padding 240 pixels from top and bottom and zero pixels from left and right actually let's actually go and change this one to 40 pixels from left and right as well and then we're gonna of course calculate the width up here again because we do not want to have above on a percent and width so I'm gonna say 100% minus 40 pixels from left and for depicts was from right which is 80 pixels like so and we do need to close the parentheses outside the calculation there we go and we need to give it a background color now so gonna say background desk color set to has tag 1 1 1 like I said I do not like to use completely black colors so I'm just going to refresh and as you guys can see you now have something going on in here now we do need to have some spacing between the footer and the last button so I'm just gonna go back in here and say I want to add a margin - top - 20 pixels like so so now we have something going on inside our website regarding a footer so now we can actually go in style the different sections here so I'm gonna go ahead and go and stop my styling copy the footer tag delete everything you have inside the code and teams - path name - footer UL then we're gonna go in between the curly brackets and the next thing we need to figure out here is the width of these menus here because if I were to go inside the design you may notice that the first menu and the second menu are not gonna have the same width because the first menu is pretty much gonna be static and it's not really gonna change unless we add another page inside the website but this menu over here is gonna change constantly each time you get a new case then we want to insert inside the website because it's the latest cases and if we were to create another case later on that is going to be a lot longer than this text here then it's going to change and with constantly so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go inside my stylesheet and I'm going to say that my menus are going to have a width said to Fitz - content because then depending on how long the menu items are is always going to change the width of the menu then I'm going to go down to the next line and say we have a float:left and then a padding - left set it to 20 pixels if I think that's enough we could try and test it out a little bit later and what we need to do now is we need to go ahead and style the list items and the anchor text as well so I'm just gonna copy paste two more times changed it from ul to Li and then change it from you l to Li a then we're gonna go ahead and just delete what we have inside the list item and inside the anchor tag and I'm just gonna go up to our first navigation so I'm just going to scroll up up up so reach the list item I'm just going to copy everything we have in here go down to the bottom and just paste everything in now I do not want the menus to be displayed in a line so I'm just gonna say not in line block but just block then I'm gonna go and delete the float:left then list style still gonna be set to none and the padding is not gonna be here like so then I am going to go ahead and copy the link styling from the first one which was right here and paste it inside at the bottom here now I don't think it's gonna be 16 pixels in size maybe 14 is a lot better and I'm gonna go ahead and change the color to white then let's go and refresh the browser just to check it and as you guys can see we now have two menus going on inside the footer here now looking at this a second time you can see that well first of all we need to have a bit more spacing in between the links and we also have the text to be slightly bigger at least for the mobile version we need to do that so I'm gonna go back inside my design oh and we also need to remove the second menu which is also a thing we're going to do so I'm going to go back inside my code and I'm going to go ahead and say that we have a line height inside the link styling so I'm gonna say line - height I'm gonna set it to something like 20 pixels like so and I'm gonna go and remove the second menuhim we need to do that by going inside our index page and apply a class to the different menus we have in here so I'm actually gonna go ahead and say we have a class which is going to be equal to footer - main - links or we could say links - main which might actually be better so that's actually going to do that then I'm gonna go ahead and copy the class paste it inside the second menu and call the second one links and - cases then I'm gonna go ahead and copy the class here for the cases one go inside my stylesheet and I'm gonna go ahead and set it to display:none like so I'm gonna go inside the website refresh and as you can see we now have something slightly different going on now for some reason that our text did not change size and that's because we forgot to change it so I'm just gonna change it to 16 pixels maybe that might even be too little so let's actually go to team set - let's go and say 24 pixels just to exaggerated a little bit to see if it looks good and and I do actually think that could work so let's actually go and change the line height from 20 to 30 refresh the browser and now we have something looks just about like it should so now we want to take care of the images which are over here so I'm gonna go and go inside my stylesheet and I'm gonna go to the bottom and say that we have a dip box which was footer - as M and I'm gonna go and style this one curly brackets I'm gonna give it a width set - the width that I want my pictures to be so I'm gonna go and set it to maybe 60 pixels and then I'm gonna go instead of float - right so it goes to the right side of the footer and then I can actually go ahead and style the images inside the footer so I'm gonna say we have the same class space IMD instead of width to 100% and I'm just gonna go and get rid of the float here I'm also gonna go and add some spacing below the images so I'm gonna save margin - bottom we could also say padding if you wanted to and set this one to something like 10 pixels now we save it refresh the browser and as you can see we get something weird going on inside the browser here now when we have a box like our photo down here that has a bunch of content inside of it which are all floating to either the left or the right side then the container that the elements are inside of have a bit of trouble recognizing that there's anything inside of it and we do have a fix for it so if we were to go inside my stylesheet as you guys can see we have a bunch of floating going on and I'm going to go and go to the container which right now is the footer so if we were to go ahead and scroll up to the foot of styling up here we can say overflow and set it to hidden and this is going to match the fix what is going on inside the browser as you can see now I do want to change the image sizes a bit so I'm going to go back inside my dip box which is called photo - SM gonna change the width to maybe 50 pixels refresh it and that looks slightly better now I do still think there's a bit too much spacing going on underneath the the menu over here so let's actually go and change the line height to something like 40 pixels just to try it out so we can actually refresh and as you guys can see it looks a lot better so now we have a footer going on inside the website as well so now this was all we wanted to do for the index page inside the mobile version and as you can see we do actually have a finished product here well not finish but at least what I wanted to do for this episode here and the next thing we're gonna go and do here is we're gonna make this one fit for a desktop version because if it were to go outside my developer view you can see that it still looks like a mobile version inside our desktop which again does not look entirely bad and this is actually one of the reasons that we want to design for mobile first because if something were to go wrong with the media core is that makes the website responsive then it always looks better to put a mobile version inside a desktop then a desktop version inside a mobile so if something goes wrong this is going to be the Starlin that is going to be applied to the website okay so we need to change the design now to make it fit a desktop version and the way we do that is by going inside our code go to the bottom here actually let's actually go and go to the bottom of the header section so going to go right after the header and I'm gonna go and create a media query for the header section only right here so we're gonna say we have at media only screen and parentheses and then we're gonna go and set a width for when is to start changing all the contents inside the website now like I said we don't have a tablet version so we're just gonna go ahead and say that when we hit the desktop version which should be around a thousand pixels then it's going to do something inside the browser and again we want to set a minimum width so we're gonna say min - with colon and then after the parenthesis we want to set a curly bracket so all the code that goes in between here are going to be things to changes once we do actually hit a desktop version so now we just need to rearrange the styling to make everything look correct so we were to go back inside our website you guys can see the menu first of all the the logo up here has to be in the left side and the navigation has to be on the right side of the logo over here the left side and then we also need to have the the link up here that needed to be in the right side over here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go inside my stylesheet and I'm gonna go and copy the styling that I had for my brand up here order the logo and paste it inside the media query then I'm going to figure out okay what do I need to change in here well I do not need to change the font family I do not need to change the font size I do not need to change the font weight I do not need to change the color I do not need to change the uppercase I do not need to change the being a blog item but I do need to change the margin the text align and the padding okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say they want to set a margin to zero and we want to set a text-align:left and we want to change the padding as well now before we do anything to the padding you need to figure out how much of the padding we need to get rid of your own taxes Center our logo inside the header so what I'm gonna do here is first of all we need to create a delay line if we're to go up inside my pistol version design you guys can see that I have a border going on the right side of the logo which I want to appear so I'm going to go inside my styling here I want to say padding not tough to bottom but right instead is going to be something like 20 pixels and I do not want to have a padding going from the left side so I'm just gonna say 20 pixels and zero pixels just to make sure we don't have a padding on the left side okay then I want to set a border - right and set it to something like two pixels actually I said to three that might actually be better three pixels a solid line and as a dark grey color which is one one one and let's actually go and see what happens inside the browser now so as you can see we do have a couple of things going on here we do have a border but it's all the way over here the right side which is because right now the link is going to be 100% width of the containers inside of and the way you fix that is by using float so if we go back inside our styling go inside our code here I can go ahead and say we want to float this specific item to the left go inside my website refresh and now you guys can see it now fixed it now what I'm gonna do next here is I don't want to have the border have a height because of the padding because it messes things up we want to Center our logo inside the header so I'm going to go back inside our code and instead of setting a padding from top and bottom I'm gonna go and set it to zero so I'm gonna go and say zero pixel from the top and bottom like so and I'm also gonna go and change the left padding because I do not want my logo to be touching the left side of the browser so I'm just gonna go and give it a lift padding as something like let's say 40 pixels just to see how it looks like and there we have it now the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to go and change the height of this border over here and we do that using line height instead because it becomes a lot easier to calculate how much we need to push down the logo when we use the line height so I'm gonna set a line height and set it to something like 30 pixels just to test it refresh the browser and now we have a slightly longer border but let's actually go and make it slightly longer so we're gonna say thirty eight pixels maybe and there we have something that looks just about right so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go back inside my code here and now we need to calculate because right now we have a header that is 100 pixels high and we need to subtract 38 pixels from 100 pixels and the result of that is then gonna be what we need to divide at the top and bottom of the logo in order to Center it so we say a hundred minus 38 which is going to be 62 and then we're going to take half of that which is going to be 31 so going to say we want to include a not padding but a margin we can actually go head and go to the margin here and say they want to have a margin top set to 31 pixels and then a left and right to zero I'm gonna save it refresh the browser and now you guys can see we centered it so now the next thing we need to do is we need to focus on the navigation which is over here centered so if I were to go back inside the code and go up and copy the navigation part which should be starting right here I can just say copy down to the anchor tag and paste it inside my media query down here and then I just need to figure out what you actually need to change inside of here so the first thing I want to do here is I want to say march into p0 not zero out so because I don't want to Center it and the width can still be the inside width at the content so we can just go and delete that we don't need to change it and we don't need to change the display block either so we just need to change the March and set to zero now we do need to add a float because we needed to go on the right side of our logo so we're gonna say float left save it then go inside the browser just to see what we did and now you guys can see if you have a precision somewhere around what we wanted to so now what I need to do is I need to push it down and we do that by going inside our code here and setting a line height inside the list item or inside the Anchor Tech depending on how much you want to be clickable so let's actually go and do it inside the anchor tag so we're gonna say line height and then we're gonna set this one to maybe 60 pixels just to try it out and then again just like we did with the logo we can then say okay we had 60 pixels and then we can do the same thing as with the logo and say we have a hundred percent height inside the header and then we can subtract the 60 pixels which is 40 and then we have 20 left over what needs to be split up into the top and bottom of the navigations so we're going to go back up inside the unordered list and say we have a margin set to 20 pixels from top and bottom and serial pixels from left and right there we go refresh the browser and now it's centered now I do want to have just slightly bit of spacing in between the portfolio and the line we have over here so I'm going to go back inside my code and I do perhaps want to add a bit of spacing on the left side so I'm gonna save that 20 from the top zero pixels from the right then zero pixels from the bottom or we could say 20 it doesn't really matter and then we could say maybe 20 pixels from the left side then I can refresh the browser and now we have a bit of spacing now I also want to make this uppercase so this actually got and change that we didn't do that in the first place so to make this uppercase both in the mobile and a desktop version we need to go back up to the mobile version styling and we need to change the anchor tag to uppercase so we're gonna save text transform uppercase and refresh the browser now the last thing we need to do inside the header is to make the the link over here the right side appear so we're going to go back inside our styling go out to the mobile version and get the header cases which we set to display:none and set it to display block so I'm just going to go down paste it in set it to display block now also we do need to remove the non necessary code from here we did paste in the rest of navigation so we did not change the inline block we did not change the float we did not change the this style and we did not change the padding I believe so we could essentially just delete this section here when it comes to the anchor tag we didn't need to do anything to the font family not anything to the size not anything to the color and not anything to what we did have a line height so we need to keep that in here so now that we have this one set to display block we can actually go ahead and go back up and add some styling to it I'm just gonna copy what we have from inside the navigation inside the mobile version paste it in here because I need to actually style it once to do X to have it appear inside the website because we haven't done that yet and I'm also gonna go ahead and copy a line height to it because I want to add a border box around it just like having said my design here I'm just going to show you guys this one right here so I need to do the same thing as I did over here with the menus but just by including a border around it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a border I'm gonna set this one to one pixel for now then I'm gonna say solid has tag 1 1 1 and let's go ahead and see how it looks like now that just kind of messes things up so let's actually go and give it a float right like so refresh it again to see how it looks like now and now you guys can see if you have it over here in the right side now what I want to do is I want to just push it out from the right side of the browser and I want to change the height of it and the width of it so I'm just gonna start by pushing it from the right side by giving that margin set to margin - right - 40 pixels because that's the same spacing we had for the logo from the left side and I'm gonna go and change the width of it and to make sure that the text is always centered inside this button here I'm gonna change the width by adding a padding to it so I'm gonna go and say we have a padding it's going to be zero from top and bottom and it's gonna be 20 pixels from left and right like so refresh it just to see how it looks like and now it has a problem with now we need to change the height so it's not gonna be a line height set to 60 but instead maybe 40 just gonna double-check and that looks a lot better you might need to change that again because I'm gonna set it to 38 so it has the same height as the line over by the logo then I'm gonna go and refresh the browser and I think that looks good enough so now we just need to push down the button a bit so we need to go inside our stylesheet and do the same thing again we need to take the height of the header which is a hundred and then subtract 38 from it which is six to two and then take half of that and add to the top and bottom so we can actually go ahead and say we want to also set a margin top margin - top - 31 pixels now we do also need to keep in mind that when we add a border to it it's gonna add one pixels to the top and bottom as well making the line hang on 38 but 38 plus 1 at the bottom and one at the top meaning that we did actually have 40 pixels of height that we needed to subtract from the hundred pixels so we're gonna go ahead and change the 31 pixels down here to 30 pixels instead so I'm gonna go ahead and go inside my browser refresh and as you guys can see we now have it centered so now we do actually have a complete menu working inside the desktop version and who were to actually go ahead and refresh the browser so you guys can actually see it change you can see that when I do actually start twitching it you guys can see it starts painting when I do actually reach that thousand pixel width I've set it to inside the media query which looks quite nice now the next thing we're gonna change here is that we want to change the height with the banner that we have inside the website so I'm going to say that we want to change the to 500 pixels because that's what I hadn't stopped my design so I'm gonna go inside my styling here and I'm going to go down and copy the media query that we had in here so I'm just gonna go ahead and find it we have it right here I'm gonna go ahead and just copy it and paste it right below the index section because now we're gonna add the media query for the index section only inside the stylesheet I'm just gonna delete all the content inside of it like so and then I'm gonna go ahead and copy the banner styling to have up inside the index section here so I'm just gonna say we have index banner gonna copy it paste it inside the media query and I'm gonna change the height to not a calculation but instead 500 pixels then I'm gonna go ahead and refresh the browser and as you guys can see we now have something looks a lot better now there's one more thing I want to do with the text inside the banner here which is to change the width of the bottom text here because it's actually quite long and I would rather have it on two lines instead of just one line so I'm going to give it a max width that it's allowed to reach before it starts jumping down to next line so I'm gonna go inside my code again and I'm gonna go ahead and copy the text styling for the bottom text which is going to be the h1 styling up here gonna paste it below here inside the media curry and I'm gonna go ahead and delete everything from in here because you don't need it and I'm gonna go ahead and give it a display:block so we make it into a block element and then we give it a width set to 600 pixels just to test it save it refresh and you will notice that the text is not censored anymore now I do think that UX design should be all the way on a new line perhaps so I'm just gonna make it slightly less wide so I'm gonna set it to 580 instead just to test it and we do need to decrease it a bit more so we're gonna say 560 and there we go now I want to Center it so I'm gonna go ahead and say we want to give it a margin set to zero Auto refresh and now you guys can see we have it centered again now looking at the design I do think I want to decrease the the height of our banner slightly more so I'm just gonna go back inside my code and gonna go up to the banner section changed it from 500 to maybe 450 now I'll do also want to delete all the other styling because we're not gonna change any of that it's just going to delete it and there we go now the next section needs to change before getting to the footer is the links down here so now we do actually need to use the classes to be applied to them inside our index page as you can see we did actually add these index box links square and rectangle until going to good news now so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go ahead and say that we want to copy one of them let's X is start with the square go inside our stylesheet and inside our media query I'm going to say we have a class called this and I'm also gonna go and copy the styling for the box itself so I'm gonna go and say if you have the box up here which was index links div gonna go down paste it in and what I want to do is I want to change these slightly so I want to say that we don't have margin set to 16 pixels but instead maybe 10 pixels on the top and the left and the right side now the bottom is just gonna stay 0 now before we continue styling the width of these boxes here we need to add a wrapper to the website because as you can see inside the design we do have a wrapper going on with the content and the photo at the bottom here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and go back inside my index page and I'm gonna go ahead and add a wrapper around some of the content here so I'm gonna go right after the main tag that we have here I'm gonna create a dip box and I'm gonna give it a class set to wrapper then I'm gonna close the wrapper around all the content we have inside the main section right down here at the bottom right after the footer like so and then I'm gonna move everything up so we can actually get some sort of organized code inside our index page here so I'm just going to move everything out once and now we need to style the wrapper so I'm gonna go inside my media query and I'm gonna go and say we have a wrapper styling so we're gonna say a class called wrapper curly brackets and the wrapper in this case is going to be a thousand pixels width so we're gonna say we have a width set to a thousand pixels a margin set to zero Auto like so and let's actually go and refresh the browser here so now you guys can see we have everything centered inside the wrapper here but we did actually include the banner which I should not have done so that's actually going to go back inside the index page and grab the wrapper delete it and just go and move back the banner section because you don't need to have that inside a wrapper so I'm just going to go and include the wrapper after the banner section like so and there we go so now we need to change the width of all the different divs that we have inside the links section down here so I'm going to go back inside my stylesheet and I'm gonna go ahead and go down to the divs X and we have down here I'm just gonna go and copy the width delete it and then insert it inside the square styling that we have down here then I'm gonna go and change it so we don't have 100% but instead 25% because if I were to go back inside the design here you guys will actually notice that all the boxes if we were to pretend that these walls squares you would actually have one two three four spots four squares which is 25% per square means that we're gonna take 25% and minus the margins we have inside the width here so we're gonna go back inside our code and say we have 25% - not 32 because you actually have I think that was 60 we had in margins in total for each side of each box like so and if I didn't go inside and refresh the browser so you guys will notice that nothing changes and that's because we still have a width applied to the dip box up here inside the mobile version and it has not disappeared yet because we haven't set a width to zero inside the dip box here but we can't do that because then it's just going to be zero so what we need to do is we need to overwrite the previous styling from inside the div here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and say after my CSS value down here I'm gonna say exclamation mark important which means that it's now going to ignore all other stylings that comes to this specific elements when it comes to the width and it's going to apply dis darling here okay so I'm gonna go and save it refresh and as you guys can see we now have something going on inside the browser here so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go ahead and change the hide as well for the div cause it should be 250 not a hundred there we go and I can access you made a mistake here because we need to go back inside the styling and not say the width should be mine 60 but instead minus 20 because we only need to take per square so I'm just gonna go back refresh like so and you might need to change the height of the boxes here because they are quite big because we want to have a square and not something looks like this so I'm gonna go back inside the styling and not say hi to 250 but maybe 230 just try it out and it looks a lot better so now the next thing we need to do is we need to go ahead and apply the styling to the rectangles and not the squares so we're gonna go and say we have another styling called index - from box link - rectangle if that is felt correctly I hope it is and we're gonna go and change the width to not 25% but 50 because the rectangles take up twice as much space as the squares so we can go ahead and say 50 percent instead refresh the browser and there we have it so now we just need to put these next to each other and we do that by going inside our styling go down to our div styling here and save float:left then I'm going to go ahead and refresh and as you can see we now have them all next to each other now after refreshing the brows I did also notice that we have different spacings going on in between and then the top and the bottom of each square so we need to change these values a bit so if we go back inside the code I'm gonna go and say that we have a margin set to 20 pixels from the top refresh the browser and there we have it now one more thing I want to do here I also want to add some spacing between the footer and the links up here so I'm going to go back inside my code and remember when we inside the footer had to apply a overflow set to hidden because we had a bunch of floating element inside a container that weren't being registered as being part of the container now it's sort of the same thing here because if I were to go ahead and just copy the index links section we have here and apply a for example of padding bottom padding - bottom set it to 20 pixels to sort of push away to further a bit go back inside the website you guys will see that nothing happens down here and that's because right now the container can actually see how many things are inside the container itself because tile floating so we need to go back inside the code and also say we want to add a overflow set to hidden go back inside the website and now you guys will see that we get this part down here with the spacing and we didn't actually need to add a padding because I do think we had that up inside the mobile version already so there we go now we need to send to the text inside the different containers so I'm going to go ahead and go inside my code and say that we have our text styling which are the h3 stylings we have up here so I'm just going to take them copy them down inside our media query and I'm gonna go and change a lot of them because we don't need to have everything except for the line height and the line height we're gonna change to what's the height of it to 30 pixels like so and refresh now you guys can see it have been centered so the last thing we need to do is we need to change the footer down here so I'm just gonna go ahead and go inside my stylesheet copy the media query part the hair up here and paste it below the footer part inside of styling then we're just going to leet everything inside the media query like so and we're going to go ahead and first of all set our footer links cases to display:block because we need to appear like so refresh the browser and now you guys can see that we have this specific section in here now we do also have a title called latest cases which needs to be styled so I'm going to go inside my index page and then what we have the footer links down here I'm just gonna go and add a paragraph styling around the text if you head down here like so now we could also use something called a span but we haven't talked about that one yet so I'm just not gonna mention it right now so now that we have this we can actually go back inside the style sheet and we can say that we have well let's actually just going to copy the styling up here called footer UL li a and just paste it right after the cases here and I'm just gonna go ahead and change the path up here to not anchor but instead paragraph then we can actually go ahead and refresh and as you can see we now have a different styling now it does need to be uppercase so let's actually go and change that I'm going to go inside the text again and I'm just gonna go ahead and make this one uppercase so we're gonna say texts - transform uppercase and refresh so now we need to do is we need to add some spacing in between these menus here so I'm just gonna go ahead and say that we want to add some spacing so I'm gonna go up here and copy my unordered list styling go down here paste it in let's actually go ahead and do it up here and I'm gonna go and set a padding right to something like 30 pixels and refresh now I do also want to delete all the stylings that we don't need to have in here so I'm just gonna move those as well now I did notice that the footer has not become part of the wrapper so we need to figure out why that has not happened yet so we're gonna go ahead and go inside our index page and see where we stopped the wrapper now I do have to wrap it down here so we need to figure out why it's not registering as actually being inside a wrapper okay so the wrapper is not working inside the footer because the wrapper is inside our main tag and the footer is not inside the main tag so we'll basically doing something a little bit weird here so this tips dialing down here is going to be part of a second wrapper we're going to include somewhere else inside the website so I'm going to copy the wrap here and I'm gonna go after the main tag and create another wrapper because we need to do that and then the closing tag for the wrapper at the top here I'm gonna go ahead and add right after we have this section inside the main tag here so I'm actually gonna go ahead and move back the main tag save it refresh and now you guys can see we have something looks right and again if that went a bit too fast for you just make sure that the wrapper closes and opens the right places so you need to have one wrapper right before the section with all the links and then it needs to close after the section with all the links then we need to add a second wrapper right before the footer and right after the footer ok now this is basically all we need to do in order to make a website that is essentially responsive so were to resize it you guys will actually see that everything changes inside the website when I start resizing it which is quite nice because now it's actually responsive which is what we wanted to have now I did say we're gonna do more pages than this and I've actually been recording for about three hours and 15 minutes if you guys have noticed a bunch of cuts in this episode it's because there's a lot of things going on in the background where I'm sitting right now so there's a lot of sounds going on that interferes with the microphone so I have actually been passing for 10 minutes at a time so my voice is sort of worn out from all the repeating I had to do when something came and interrupted so I'm gonna go and split this project into two episodes so the first one here is going to be at a mobile responsive front page and the entire front page and then the second episode is going to be the two sub pages because we did essentially already create the header and the footer and the mobile responsiveness which we're not gonna do for two sub pages so I hope you guys enjoyed this little project and I'm gonna go ahead and create a second episode what is project here okay hey guys hope you enjoyed this video I just want to say thank you for the support you've given me on YouTube and gave out a huge
