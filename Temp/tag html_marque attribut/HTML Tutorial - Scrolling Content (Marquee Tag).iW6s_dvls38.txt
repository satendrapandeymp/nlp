hey everyone today I'm going to show you how to scroll text images and even tables in HTML using a tag called marquee so let's get started okay so the first thing we want to do is we want to open up notepad once you've opened up notepad type in the HTML the standard HTML tags so HTML head title whatever the title may be and if you don't understand what's going on here up in my previous HTML tutorials close the head and open the body tag this is my text close the body tag and close the HTML tag now if we save this say file save as I'm going to save it to the desktop as index.html press save minimize this if we opened up our we open up our HTML document this is my text now as you can see it's just still it's solidly there nothing's moving nothing's doing anything but now to scroll the text and all you do is you open up a new tag called marquee and we want to just close the marquee tag and file save go back to our HTML document refresh it and it's now scrolling and there you go that's all it is it's just a marquee tag that's that's all it is now as you can see it's scrolling across the whole page the whole 100% width of the page and which is it's great for some for some things but obviously if you're implementing this into a full website you may not want it to go all the way so we're going to minimize this we're going to go back to the HTML document coding and as you can see it's going yet it's going all the way so we're going to go marquee I'm going to go in there side the tag and we make a space width equals open speech marks 20% closed beachmarks and file save go back to it press refresh as you can see it's only going 20% width of the page it's only scrolling on 20 width of the page which would be ideal for implementing into a smaller webpage we can change this we can do 40% I can go to file save or ctrl s press refresh or f5 and it's now going 40% of the width of the page now we can scroll just about anything in HTML doesn't have to be text so now what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to scroll an image we're going to school scroll the Google logo so we're going to find out what the Google logo is you're going to go to properties and you can find out what the address of the logo is we're going to copy this page the link to the logo right click clock up write good copy sorry and go back to the HTML document get rid of this is my text and add an image tag so IMG SRC equals in speech marks paste in paste in the link closed speech marks close the tag go back to you are our document and then it's now scrolling the Google image on 40% again you can change this to 100% or whatever you wish to do with this Google image and there you go that's how to scroll content on HTML documents thanks for watching guys please subscribe
