and memorable name for your brand is super important and I actually wish I had a lot of the information I'm going to be sharing this video years ago when I started on YouTube and I also wish that I thought a little bit bigger because I know this video is about coming up with a youtube name but I really encourage you to be thinking with about your brand name thinking about a website your social media the overall brand that you want to build online and not just your YouTube channel so this video is gonna be broken into three steps the first one is kind of how to kind of come up with a name the second one is some of my favorite tools and then the third step is going to be all about some of the mistakes that I hope I think everybody should avoid when trying to come up with a solid name or even rebrand their channel so let's jump into it so how do you actually come up with a name for your YouTube channel well probably one of the easiest ways is actually to just use your first and last name if you're stuck this is actually a really good way to go especially if you're building a personal brand you know I do a lot of work in the entrepreneur space and when I think about that space I think about people like Tony Robbins chalene johnson gary vaynerchuk marie forleo or whoever write those brand names lewis howes their youtube channels are just their first and their last name and what's nice about that is that as you grow and progress you're really just building real estate around your name and not necessarily around a brand name that could change when you change maybe even what your niche or what your topic is whereas you evolve so that's probably one of the easiest ways to pick out a name it's just a person last name the second option of course is coming up with like an actual brand or creative name of some sort and so here's a few tips if this is the direction that you're going one I think it's very powerful if you include the topic of your YouTube channel in the name meaning is the name actually relevant to your content so some of my favorite brand names out there one of them is nerd Fitness and what I love about that name is it's a brand name and it's a fitness brand that's helping not just learn fitness tips but specifically for a specific group of people so you have the topic and you also have really the niche gamers nerds you know cosplay whatever nerd fitness super saw the name another one is say like Epic Meal Time and that's very popular channel on YouTube it's a normal Cooking Channel and you add the epic on top of it and if you've ever seen the channel it's a lot of outrageous like 10000 calorie meals a lot of just epicness to what they're doing so again a solid name and so if you were thinking about this let's say you had like a real estate brand you're doing a YouTube channel with real estate tips you could do something like rocking real estate you know or whatever it is and you've got kind of the actual topic included in a creative sticky and memorable name another variation of this would be to do a hybrid name and so that's where you do your topic and then your name so for instance let's say you were doing After Effects with Austin and the channel was all about After Effects tips or maybe beauty with Britney you know and you're also seeing that kind of rhyming in the same first letter but just you could try some things like that like what is your topic and then what is maybe your first name or a nickname of some sort and so that's another option and then one of the things that you would want to think about here is again make it memorable and make it sticky so ways to do that would be like fierce fitness and that rhyming as well as the first few letters there kind of makes it memorable one of my favorite YouTube channels is called charisma on command and I think that's a great name very sticky the channel is all about you know how to build your charisma be more effective in social situations even be or better on camera all those types of things but a really solid name that is memorable and that is also stickier than the last tip on picking out your name is model the Masters and that's actually a good name but what I mean by that is actually look at some of the channels you look up to look at some of your favorite online brands and look at how they name their stuff and then maybe just use it as a framework or a formula so if you like that charisma on command vibe what words could you plug in there for your name that's your topic as well as maybe an adjective or something that has some energy to it for the name so we talked about in step one it's kind of how to pick out your name in different name formats step two is adding some tools to the mix and so some of my favorite tools are one simply thesaurus.com you know when you're looking maybe for an adjective if you're going that kind of brand-name direction that is a great way to think about what you want to convey maybe it's you know motivational or maybe it's fierce you know fitness and but you like somebody has that so you're trying to type in fierce and see other variations of that I think it's Saurus is a great tool and then another set of tools as I'll link up in the description below but are some websites like bust a name or name boy or name mesh and these are actually sites that help you pick out a domain domain name it actually lets you know what's available but they also give you some creative combos and so it says enter two words and it gives you some variations it'll even mix up some of the adjectives and it will also let you know which we'll talk about in a second if the actual dot-com or any domain is available which I think is important I think that if you're watching this channel you're part of the think media TV community that I really want you to be thinking bigger than just YouTube be thinking about building an actual brand building really even a business like you're an entrepreneur be thinking outside of the box and be thinking about your brand overall not just on YouTube so definitely check out that list of resources and go through those websites and I bet that if you spend you know 10 or 30 minutes like entering some different words into those website you're going to discover a lot of cool ideas for coming up with a cool name and then the final step here number three I want to talk about is some of the biggest mistakes that I see people making when it comes to picking out a name and I think you should run your name through these this framework first to really avoid you know pitfalls later on and so the first one is not checking to see who online is maybe already using that name and I don't just mean because of copyright I just mean that if you for instance thought you know maybe you're not watching this channel and obviously you are watching this channel but if you never knew about this channel and you're like think media would be a cool name type it into Google type it into YouTube you're going to see that a lot of market share a lot of ranked videos are taken around that name right so you might want to keep looking same thing maybe your personal brand you can't help if you have the exact same name as somebody else and they're really established online but you could think about a way to position yourself where they may be adding another word like After Effects with Austin as opposed to maybe some person named Austin that is like ranking everywhere by kind of niching things down so the first mistake is just not doing the research to see if anybody else had the name and then secondly the big mistake that I see is not checking to see if your name is available on social media so for instance when we were starting video influencers Benji and I a few years ago one of the things that we did was we research to see if the name was used by anybody else then we actually went around to see is all the social media accounts taken and what we mean is like the actual URLs like Instagram com4 slash video influencers we got Facebook we got YouTube we got Instagram we got Twitter with no s because we maxed out the characters with just video influencer so this is I think a great thing to do when you're just starting out and even if you want to expand onto other social media platforms to look to see if maybe a brand name or rebrand is available now don't get stuck here because there's plenty of people that are crushing it at world-class levels that have a different Instagram name than their YouTube channel than their Facebook page but it is really nice if you can have unity across those brands and so just put it on kind of your to-do list to run through your process of coming up with a name and a cool resource that I down here is name-check calm that's named chk calm which is actually placed where you can type in all the characters of your name and it will tell you what platforms it's taken on so like when I type in video influencer you start seeing the platforms that I've taken here here here here and here and it lets you rather than going from platform to platform to check it lets you do it all in one place so that's a great resource and I'll link that up in the description as well mistake number three I see people making is not saying if the domain is available the URL because even if you don't want to start a website now it's really great to get the domain and you can also always just redirect that domain to your YouTube channel between now and maybe whenever you might want to start a YouTube channel so the other thing about this is I really still believe that there's all even though there's all these other URLs out there dotnet dot you know whatever now it's like dot live Vegas there's like all these URLs I still think that dot-com is the most powerful especially if you want to build a world-class brand now the disclaimer is again don't get stuck here for video influencers we can't even find the dot-com person we offer to money is this not responding somebody bought PSICOM and just sits on it and they're not using it but we got net and so again run your names through these filters but don't necessarily make it make or break the name so we said fine we'll go with net and it's not like it's a huge problem but ideally if you can get the dot-com did you get the social media if nobody else has it you're on a great trajectory for finding an awesome name mistake number four is using numbers in your name and so I like to say avoid this you know rather than just using like Sean can all be like Sean channel 65 or Sean kennel eleven or whatever and usually why this is a problem is number one if you say it verbally on like a live or on a podcast or with somebody they might not know if it's typed out they might not know if it's if it's actually spelled out you know the numbers versus the actual word and it also can just not you know potentially not be very professional right and a lot of times back in the day I remember when the email started that's how old-school I am I remember you know if you oh shoot my my email address is not available on hotmail so instead of doing Sean kennel at hotmail calm it'd be like Sean kennel two one five six four you know or just like your favorite lucky number like the year of your first car and all that's cool but again it kind of has that vibe right it's not necessarily super professional so if possible unless there's a very strategic and intentional reason maybe like there's that it actually is on brand and there is a reason for doing it well then absolutely do it but typically I recommend avoiding numbers in your name mistake number five is if the name is hard to spell because think about this you know we live in a world where you really want to think about the practicality of sharing that name and someone trying to remember it and then maybe type it in on social media later or figure out what it is later and so I think that sometimes you can't avoid this for instance my name is Sean kennel and nobody knows how to spell Cannell and nobody knows that a safe Channel and so it is kind of hard to communicate so even if I'm on a podcast and I'm being interviewed I will actually say you know you can follow me on Twitter at Sean kennel that's se a n CA n e ll I'll actually spell it out because I'm thinking about that so that's kind of a strategy as well you can't ultimately change your name if it is kind of confusing but never forget that like you can just assume people know how to spell your name and sometimes even when you're typing in an Instagram you're like what was it again over the first few letters so always be thinking about how can you make things as simple as clear as memorable as easily communicate able if you're going to be on Facebook live or YouTube live and you say something verbally can it be remembered and is it going to be complex to spell especially when picking out YouTube names domains URLs keep it simple and make it very very easy to spell and one way around this is kind of cool is Gary Vaynerchuk try to spell Vaynerchuk right he on social media actually is gary vee so he shortened his name gary vee and he then will say that so you could follow me everywhere like gary vee spells it out right so that's kind of a hack to be thinking from the beginning how can i make this very shareable and member well and simple for years to come and then lastly one of the big mistakes that I see people making online is having an inconsistent name across the internet and so what I mean is maybe their YouTube channels name one thing and then their Twitter is different and their Facebook is different I don't even just mean the URL I just mean their actual branding and so be thinking about not just coming out with a solid name that hopefully includes your topic and has a strong message to it it's memorable it's simple but then also be thinking about then making sure that that messaging is consistent across all of your channels so even if you already have a name that might be some good spring cleaning if you will to really think is my name my brand messaging consistent across all platforms online question of the day what are your tips for coming up with a cool and memorable name for YouTube or just for your brand online post those in
