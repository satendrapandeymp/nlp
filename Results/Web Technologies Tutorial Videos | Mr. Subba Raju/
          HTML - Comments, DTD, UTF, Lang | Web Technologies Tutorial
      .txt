hi guys welcome to narration technologies this is Subarus you will see another video session on HTML so in last video session we observed how to create a web page and that continued what are the comments available how to add a comments in HTML document generally comments means ignore statements ignore tax also we can say using comments we can declare customized or user-defined statements within the source code in HTML these comments are classified into two types one is single line comments second one is multi-line comments single line comments are restricted to a specific line multi line comments are specific to one or more lines now if you are observing HTML comments we are writing angular bracket exclamation double hyphen then whatever the comment lines available mentioned again double hyphen close this is commenter notation it is only single line comment and same if you are adding multiple lines and that is multiple so you can write some more lines here and if you close this is multi-line comments means single line comment multi-line comment having same notation that practically I will show you next doctype HTML of course if you remove this without this one doctype is representing the version information of the HTML document on which version HTML you implemented this webpage or this website this doctype is indicating that up to HTML 4.1 means before HTML 5 writing doctype is too critical if you are using any ide directly integrating means automatic when you select HTML document automatically version related document information inserting manually we are not writing because that much critical that is to write manually very critical in HTML for environment these dog types are classified into like these three types strict to dot a DTD frame set to dot a DTD lose a daughter DTD what is the DTD document type a definition strict a daughter DTD all the elements it is checking strictly opened strictly closed deprecated elements are not allowed deprecated means deleted some tags are deleted from html5 version those attacks are not entertained here are some tags deleted in HTML for also those tags also not entertain in strict adore DTD frames that are not allowed second one is a frame setter dot DTD so if you are using this whenever you are implementing frames in the web page you should use this document type definition it is a library type it is not mandatory but in HTML for version declaring always better and lucid or to DTD duplicated tags also we can declare frames also we can declare that is we are calling loose dot DTD so finally in HTML 4.0 and 0 one level doc types available but they same thing in html5 level no doc x nothing directly we can declare a doctype HTML so without this this doctype is indicating the version information of the HTML including these four it indicates html5 version indication because it is tml five not a double upward on sgml based so i will show you that one practically next HTML doctype is completed fourth one HTML lang is equal to en - iron what is this HTML Lang attribute hTML is the root element every HTML - starts with HTML tag every HTML document ends with HTML tag between whenever we are using that language also compulsory language attribute means Lang attribute indicating this webpage or this website content written in which language and which country related that one for example English language en I supplied Indian English language means C vuelvo you are not a sieve o elbow are you need to understand correctly my meaning of that I am NOT talking about the software development principle I am talking about a completely web-based content whatever the text you are seeing on the web page that texture should be Indian English for example I mentioned here UK this is concerned ER United Kingdom so their English we are using like that every country they have their own two letter code injured New Zealand and US United States like that every country they have every language they have Hindi a chai Telugu te Arabic AR like that every language they have their own two letter code for example you are not a mentioned anything just you wrote like this you close by default it is American English reflecting so this is a languor tribute Lang attribute indicating their primary language of EV a page or website whichever the content available next one is finally meta care set u TF - 8 actually meta care set is nothing but what character set we are implementing and Unicode transformation for Madison's multilingual it is octal number system so one byte is equal to 8 bits that is ASCII not only that any language every language is equal to 1 byte equal to 8 bits format the meaning is u TF - 8 commonly in every web page in real-time industry if you are observing one live application completely this information available after this information I will discuss header section and body section so mainly HTML document has three sections three parts first one is version information second one is header section third one is body section now whatever I am discussing almost all these are comes under version information level frankly and of course this is we are using at level as well as body level but mat I'm explaining completely related to the principles once these are completed I will give a clear idea practically first let's will try to observe practically how to use on real-time web pages will observe the practically one by one the comments HTML comments comments already said ignore statements or non executable statements with the help of comments we can able to write customized information comment starts with and a comment ends with just will see one practical example HTML HTML header section title title my comments and title closed header section closed body open body close HTML close working with comments so once you are writing save so HTML every tag you can check with the concern head and head title and title related body body related so save the file and execute on any web browser right click and refresh my comments working with the comments for example you want to comment this just you can exclamation double hyphens and again - - I dealer now refresh yes you are expecting correct nothing will be displayed because I made comment that it is a single line comment if you want to make sure this is multi-line comment just you can take the line and take multiple times and the symbol you can cut it and this is multi-line comments now also no line displayed on the webpage now for example this comment you are making from here to the before line and it is comment but last line display because it is not commented like this single line comments available multi-line comments available but notation is same whatever we applied single line as well as multi line okay right for example I am removing this and this is also I am removing right now how many lines visible right refresh it I am removing last two lines and as per our expedition two lines should be visible yes refresh but one line only visible so by default web page a display is single line to break that line generally we are using BR tag is nothing but break of course in upcoming videos this BR tag I'll discuss what is non-paid all the things let me complete first how to display multiple lines just as shown right come back I am doing this one comment write comment notation added double hyphen and comment added here angular and refresh yes displaying that because title pot doesn't supports any comments comments only applicable to head applicable to body but not applicable to title pot so this is a comment comments of the next explained very clearly regarding version information total three parts available HTML document these a version information had a section body section let me finish first what is version information a doctype always in what version HTML you implemented on this web page or website so doctype is that it is not a tank it is a kind of library and doctype tells web browsers and validators what version of HTML the page is written in so it is commonly different types of Alvina for what are that one is strict to daughter DTD frame set the daughter DTD loose dot a DTD document to type definitions are classified into mainly three types in HTML for environment or 4.01 environment these doctype declarations are three types independently what they are doing strict or daughter DTD see that this DTD contains all HTML elements and attributes but does not include presentational or formatter we are calling deprecated means deleted that's not available strict that is a library if you copy this library if you are going to paste in the browser the concerned library is going to be displayed that I am trying to show you this is the concerned library just to try to observe that don't require any information here because what this library contains practically you want to see miss just observe that cell so it is a kind of library developed in 4.01 it is strictly dot the DTD what is restricted or - DTD already I made very clearly it not allowed frame sets also come to frame set a daughter DTD it allows the frames frames means a frame set available frame available no frames available definitely upcoming videos will see practically that but this is allowing all attributes plus frame set to content and complete doctype is like this available is a bigger and if you are coming to transitional or lose this is what we are calling optional it contains all elements attributes as well as including presentational including duplicates but frame sets are not allowed here right come down to this this much bigger syntax in html5 update environment area we are writing in a simple manner why we are writing simply doctype HTML right in uppercase right in lower case upper lower lower upper because HTML is not a case sensitive and html5 also not case sensitive but it's tml five all tags not the base one is GML not on standard generalized markup language it is a completely related to non HTML so and there the complete it does not require any kind of because it is not developed on sgml so that is a reason no need to insert complete adopt type reference to html5 now doc type HTML clearly available now whatever i explained about doctype it always indicates version information related to HTML these are different types in HTML 4 but in HTML 5 it is only one doctype HTML it is not a tag it is a kind of library document type definition I am coming to next one that is called a care set if you are going to any live web sites commonly meta care set UTF - 8 available here UTF indicates Unicode transformation format Unicode transformation format means multilingual not only English all languages that is multilingual we are calling what purpose we are inserting that unicode you need to define the character encoding of your web page character encoding tells browsers and validators what set of characters to use when rendering web pages from server to client and unicode dot words official website available that website what they are giving about Unicode they're showing about no matter what the platform any platform we can use no matter what the program is any kind of technology no matter what the language any language Chinese Arabic Hebrew Hindi Telugu any kind of languages we can use because UTF is giving the flexibility to the web browser to display all language with the equal importance that syntax available HTML for meta http-equiv lends content to type and content equal to text or HTML care set equal to UT f - 8 this much bigger syntax cut down in HTML 5.0 within two words meta care set is equal to UT of eyghon 8 UT of already said it means octal number system 1 byte is equal to 8 bits applicable to multilingual all languages now that related information implemented and full form also implemented very clearly Unicode transformation format and finally we'll observe what about this specifying language if you are coming to any live environment for example I am going to world a popular web site google.com once you are going to google.com control you view source code once we are going to view source code they are making very clearly Lang is equal to en - I n en eyghon I n now I am coming back to Google I am clicking on official language India is Hindi once I click on indeed it is converting it in the right come to view source code just to refresh that and again it is immediately converting into lang is equal to a chain so from this indication a simple understanding is every language they have their own two letter code Hindi a chai the middle tea a Telugu te Arabic AR Chinese CH like this every language they have their own to letter code if you want to view these two letter codes related information please visit wtae.com they are providing complete information related to two letter code plus now I am coming back to again Google and I am taking on my mother language Telugu then I am refreshing that once i refresh again it is converting into the related language tea so finally Lang attribute is indicating the primary language of your web page specifying primary language of your pace it is a good practice for both usability accessibility and browsers scream roses the screen renders and other user agents means why I am giving this much clearly means generally standards are compulsory required when we are developing a website in the real time industry of course these are the basics doesn't required while you are practicing but if you know you are getting better idea to develop a good website as per w3c standards now I am coming to that how to declare HTML Lang is equal to en whenever you are not mentioned any country by default it takes United States of America if you mentioned a country to letter code every country they have their own two letter code ie n India entered New Zealand u.s. United States UK United Kingdom with that I implemented complete information Indian English and us English if you are not writing also by default your Singlish and Great Britain like this complete information we can provide related to the content of the web page I am NOT talking about any logical and source code completely I am talking about only the content or text which is available on the web page that should be follow a specific country means specific language available see vuelvo you are that is our color spelling c vuelvo R that is American English spelling like this if you are going to implement the text that takes related but software always American English rules following so these are the standards whatever explained to you the first one explained to you comments second one I made a very clearly doctype regarding HTML version information and doctype Sai explain and third one I made very clearly UT of eyghon eight what is unicode Cassatt what purpose we are using if you are able to visit go to unicode dot o-r-g and you can see that one also just press unicode dot o-r-g you are getting directive set just go to new to unicode and what is a Unicode just if you are clicking the website URL and in the first line only they are providing very clear-cut information regarding unicode if you are really interested to know about Mehta care set please visit this URL this you are this URL Werner is w3c w3c already previous in the previous video very clearly explained to you and finally explained about the primary language of your website regarding content and how we are writing also is shown very clearly HTML Lang language name - country name then you can question why should I write with only HTML you can write this global attribute with any tag but hTML is the root element every HTML document starts with HTML and average tml document ends with again HTML so when you are writing with HTML this Lang attribute you will get more benefit on that one thank you for watching my videos catch me for more videos youtube.com slash narration T
