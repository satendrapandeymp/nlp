hi guys in this tutorial will understand the sandbox attribute of iframe tag so let's get started well iframes can contain content from other sources we do not trust and can have malicious intent sandboxing iframes help to apply certain restrictions on the content of the iframe to prevent it from malicious attack so let's see a simple example of sandboxing here in this code I have created an iframe which holds this file that is test dot HTML which contains the link to an image now inside this let's use the sandbox attribute so I write sandbox I am keeping the value of sandbox attributes as empty keeping its value empty means we have applied all restrictions what these restrictions are we'll see in a few seconds for now just save and then this code now let's click on this link you can see nothing happens when I click on this link it does not takes me to the next page that's because we have sandbox the iframe sandboxing iframes blocks certain permissions of the iframe now let's understand this in detail and see how we can allow certain features while blocking others how sandboxing works well in sandboxing we first remove all the permissions by setting the value of sandbox to empty as shown here and iframe with sandbox value as empty will have the following restrictions scripts are disabled forms cannot be submitted stops frame content from using plugins frame content will be treated from a unique origins hence it will not have access to data stored in earlier cookies new windows or browsing contexts cannot be created by the frame document frame document cannot navigate its top-level parent automatically triggered features like auto playing videos etc are blocked and api's are blocked now please do not panic if you are unable to understand certain terms like unique origin or top-level parent or browsing context I'll explain each of these features in a few seconds for now just have a look at them and we'll come back to them in a few seconds well you just saw keeping the value of sandbox as empty means applying all restrictions we just discussed them but what if you want to allow certain permissions while blocking others this can be done by giving values to the sandbox attribute the values the sandbox attribute can take are allow forms allow pointer lock allow pop-ups allow same-origin allow scripts and allowed top navigation let's see what each of these values means and how to use these values in a code the first value is allow same origin well what does it mean to be of the same origin same origin policy states that a web page can have access to a second web page only if both have the same origin i repeat same origin policy states that a web page can have access to a second web page only if both have the same origin the origin of a web page is calculated using URI port number and hostname well if you are unfamiliar with URI port number and hostname please watch my videos on these topics for this video I presume you understand what these terms means so so let's say a few examples to understand same-origin policy let's say this is my first page and has the URL as this and I have another page with the URL as shown now if you compare the above two URLs you can see both have the same protocol host and port hence they both belong to the same origin another example would be here both the pages have the same protocol and host but different port numbers hence they do not belong to the same origin and another example would be again they will not have the same origin because they have different hosts now that we know what the same origin let's get back to sandbox attribute this is my code which will have an output like this I want when I click on this link in the iframe it should take me to another page let's click this you can see when I click on the link nothing happens that's because the value of sandbox attribute is set to empty hence same origin policy is blocked let's unlock it by setting the value of sandbox attribute as allow same origin let's test this again you can see when I clicked on the link it took me to the other page of the same origin without any blockage as the blockage was removed by setting sandbox value to allow same origin next value that the sandbox attribute can take is allow forms setting this value of sandbox attribute allows forms to be submitted we have three files here the first file contains the code for iframe the second file is contact form dot HTML the iframe displays the form contained in the file contact form dot HTML this is the code for creating the form once the form is submitted and output is displayed to the user with the help of this file that is formed report dot PHP well a lot of you might be new to HTML and hence are not aware of how forms are created or what is a PHP script for those people I would suggest you to understand as much as you can and try to take an overview here without going into much details later when you get time watch my videos on creating forms and PHP script to understand this better also if you are testing this code make sure you have a vamp server installed on your PC since you need a vamp server to test PHP scripts so getting back to sandbox attribute you can see we have set the value of sandbox as empty meaning all restrictions are applied let's run this code now let's fill the email ID now let's submit the form you can see I'm unable to submit the form that's because iframe is sandbox completely in order for the form to be submitted we need to set the sandbox attribute to allow forms so let's do that now let's run this again you can see the form is now being submitted so this is how you use the allow forms value of sandbox attribute next is allow top navigation well first we need to understand what does it means what does it means to allow top navigation top navigation allows us to open the linked document in the full body of the window or the top browsing context what this means is you see I have this link in an iframe now since the link is inside iframe it should open the link document inside this iframe however if I click on this link you can see the image opens in the main window instead of opening in the iframe this type of behavior can be obtained with top navigation let's see the code for this you can see here in the code I have created an iframe which displays the content of image dot HTML which is this file in image dot HTML we have created a link to open an image please note we have said the target attribute of anchor tag as top we need to set the value as top since we want the link to open in the full body of the window so coming back to this code here let's see what happens when we first remove this value that is a lot of navigation let's save and run this you can see when I click on this link nothing happens that's because we have sandbox the iframe in a way that it blocks top navigation now let's see what happens when we allow top navigation so setting the value here in the sandbox as a lot of navigation now I'm running the code again let's click on this link you can see the link document now opens in the full body of the window or the top browsing context so this is how you can use a loud top navigation value next value that the sandbox attribute can take is allow scripts setting this value of sandbox attribute allows scripts to be executed in a sandboxed iframe let's understand this with an example this is our code here we have created an iframe and inside this iframe we have loaded the file javascript dot HTML this is a very basic JavaScript code to display hello world as output let's see what happens when the sandbox attribute is empty so let's remove this allow scripts value and let's save and run this you can see nothing is displayed in the iframe no script is executed that's because we have blocked these scripts using sandbox now let's allow scripts so setting the value to allow scripts let's say even run this you can see the output of this script is now visible in the iframe so this is how you can use allow scripts value of sandbox attribute to allow scripts to be executed the next value is allow popups setting this value of sandbox attribute allows pop-up to be displayed this is our code I have created a very basic pop-up here with the help of anchor tag by setting the value of target as blank such that when the user clicks on this link the Linda document is opened in a new tab or window so this is a very basic pop-up being created and this is our code to create the iframe where we have loaded image dot HTML the value of sandbox is allow same origin pop-ups are still blocked so in the output pop-ups should not open so let's run this let me click here you can see when I click here nothing happens the link document does not open in the new tab even though we have set the value of target as Blanco this is because I frame is sandbox - to block pop-ups so let's now modify the code to allow pop-ups so setting the value of sandbox as allow pop-ups let's see even done this again now let's click this again now you can see as I click on this link the pop up is not clogged and it appears in the new tab here this is it we are done with sandbox attribute of iframes thank you guys for watching this video if you liked this video do not forget to subscribe I will keep uploading more videos on HTML
