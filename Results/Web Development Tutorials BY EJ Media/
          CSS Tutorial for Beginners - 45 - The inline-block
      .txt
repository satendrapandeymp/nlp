I've had numerous requests to talk about in line - block and of course that is one of the values that you can set the display property - and people want to know what the difference is between the in line - block and the difference between just regular inline and regular block so what I've done here is I've created three separate pages that contain initially at least exactly the same code you can see we're setting it initially to inline all three of these and then eventually we'll flip these but for now we're just going to keep them all the same and we're using the same exact text so we've set up a span now remember a span is a true inline element that is we have no height and we have no width we get none of that with an inline element even though I've set it to here you can see that it's ignored we don't have any height here because this is a true inline element ASP in our span is right here and you'll remember it will expand out to the width and height of the text in this case text - Rita so we'll simply cover that area it will ignore any height or even with if we put a width in here that would be ignored as well so now what we're going to do is flip this to block down here and let's see what happens and we'll hit refresh and there you can see now this is a block element did you see what happen here we got a new line because remember block elements go top down not side by side by side so we get a line break and it created a line break right after more right because the span element has now been converted to a block element so it gets its own complete line all by itself you'll notice now that the height property that we put in here is now recognized the browser recognizes it because it's a block element it also expanded to the entire width of the page now if we put a width of 50 pixels in here it would just cut it off at 50 pixels now let's set this page to inline - block and we'll see what happens and we'll hit refresh and take a look what happen here it's kind of a best of both worlds I like to think of this as a hybrid it's kind of half in line in half block you'll notice that we didn't get a new line break like we did when we set this to pure block so that is acting more like an inline but it did recognize the height so we did get that fifty pixels of height so that's what an inline block is it's just half and half it has some characteristics of an inline and it has some characteristics of a block it's not totally a block it's not totally an inline in other words it's not totally a block because we didn't get a new line break as we did down here with a pure block setting but it's not pure inline either in that it's obeying our height property which we set 250 pixels now you could also put a width in here and it would also pay attention to that as well so that's really what the inline block is it does a little bit of inline and it does a little bit of block so again it's kind of a best of both worlds we don't get a new line break which of course is a classic inline remember it's side by side by side we don't get a new line break like we do with a block but this value does actually recognize our height that we set which is 50 pixels so that's how it works okay see you guys in the next video
