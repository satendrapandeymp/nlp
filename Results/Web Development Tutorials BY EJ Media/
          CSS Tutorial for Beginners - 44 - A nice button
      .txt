in this CSS video we're going to design a button and I've had a lot of requests from subscribers to do a really cool looking button that they can use for their website so this code will be very very reusable in fact button code in terms of CSS is some of the most reusable code now we're not going to create a menu like we did in the last video these are strictly just going to be buttons so that's why there's no div element tag here we're strictly going to be creating buttons in this video and so we're going to use the standard UL element tag and the li element tag followed by a anchor tag so I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste the first set of code and we're going to discuss it so here's our button class that I've created right here and actually let's hit refresh over here so I can go over each one of these so the background color is going to be this gray right here we're going to set the border at one pixel solid we're going to have a border radius of three pixels now this first value here is how bold we want the font to be and for my buttons I always like to set those at 700 so that's how bold I want my text to look inside my button we're going to set the button to 13 pixels and Helvetica is going to be the first font that we want to load if we can't load that then we'll load the Arial font we're going to set the height of our button to 30 pixels and we're going to set the line height to 28 pixel now you remember that line height Centers our text in the middle of our button and the way you do that is you want that very close to the value that you set in the height and usually I like to set it a couple pixels under what I set for the height so 28 pixels is a good number now we haven't done this before but we're actually using two parameters here for the padding and if you have two settings in here like we do right here this first value stands for the top and bottom so we're setting that to zero pixels and this 20 pixels stands for the right and left side so we have 20 pixels on the right and 20 pixels on the left we are going to align our text in the center and we're only going to set a margin on the right which is 10 pixels and that's because I don't want margin all the way around my buttons in fact all this does is really create 10 pixels of space between our buttons and since I don't want 20 pixels different I'm just going to set ten pixels on the right we could actually make this left doesn't matter now this property right here box sizing gives a really nice effect to our buttons it kind of gives it a box effect now there's a lot more to this property that I'm explained and I'll do a future video on that but for now we're just going to make this our last property in our button code alright so let me copy and paste some more code in here and I'll explain it so now what we want to do is work against the UL and we've done this in several other videos we want to set the padding to zero and we want to get rid of the bullets and we also want to display the buttons side-by-side now since we didn't really create a menu in this video these are just buttons you could keep these vertically it doesn't matter you can use these buttons in any way you want but in this video we're going to have them side-by-side okay so let's go ahead and hit refresh and now you can see they're side by side by side they have ten pixels of margin between them and the bullets are now gone so this is looking pretty good but we need to add some more code down now so now what we want to do is work against the anchor tag so we've created our base button code we've put some code against the UL we've put some code against the li now what we want to do is work against the anchor tag and that of course is everything that's displayed in the hand everything that the hand can click on so let's go ahead and copy and paste this in here and let's go ahead and hit refresh and then I'll explain the code so we've created this dark grey for the color of the text now and of course as we've done many times we remove the underlining with the text - decoration property we set that to none now we floated this left and that actually increases the size of our button I'm going to explain this in a future tutorial this concept but for now just know that by putting the float here we've actually increased the size of the button again I'll explain this in a future video but of course we're not done yet we need to create a hover effect and that's probably the most important effect in terms of buttons so I'll copy and paste this in here and let's save this up let's hit refresh and look how great this looks we have a nice gradient effect notice how the background color changes to a little bit darker gray now from this initial gray that we use and that gives us that nice gradient look at that so that the user knows when their cursor is over that particular button I think that looks really really good and you'll notice now that we make the color of the text of much stronger black see how that stands out so it really stands out we're changing the color of the text and we're adding a gradient feel to the button so there you go we'll design other buttons but this is one of my favorite buttons and it's very very reusable because gray really matches just about any color that you have on your website so this is a really really good color to use okay that's going to do it for this video see you guys in the next video
