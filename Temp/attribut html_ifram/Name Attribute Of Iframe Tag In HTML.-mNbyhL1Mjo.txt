hi guys in this tutorial we'll understand the name attribute of iframe tag so let's get started well name attribute is used to assign name to an iframe named iframes are mostly used with target attribute of anchor tag when we want to open the linked document in a particular iframe let's understand this with an example so I have this code here in this code I have created two links that is picture one and picture two with the help of anchor tag and I have also created an iframe let's see how this code looks like in the browser so let's save and run this so here are my two links and the iframe let's click on one of these links you see as I clicked on the link the linked document gets opened in the same window on which it was clicked now I want when I click on these links the pictures should open in the iframe instead of opening in the same window well this kind of behavior can be obtained if we assign name to this iframe using name attribute and in the next step we set the target attribute of these two links equal to the name assigned to the iframe so let's do that let's first assign name to the iframe using name attribute so I write name equals say iframe one now in the second step we said the target attribute of these two links equal to the name of the iframe so let's do that so I write target equals i frame one and similarly for the second link let's save and run this let's click on the link so you see we are now able to open the linked document inside the iframe so this was a very basic example of how named attribute of iframe tag can be used thank you guys for watching this video if you like this video do not forget to subscribe I'll keep uploading more videos on HTML bye
