Wow yo people I'm Sean from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 3 HTML syntax and structure alright now in the last lesson I briefly mentioned that everything in HTML is pretty much controlled by a tag so let's just have a quick recap on that so we've got HTML and it's a markup language and all this meaning is that we're marking up content for display in a browser and we do this via tags all right and there's a lot as a different type of tags we've got P text at paragraphs H tags for headings which this example follows this is a h1 tag and so that's going to display as a header or heading rather to a user in a browser all right so let's look at a few specific examples of tags and I'm going to jump over to notepad to do that alright so here we go I'm in notepad right now and I've got a simple tag here and by the way when you're when you're creating HTML files what you want is a text editor that's not going to format text for you and by that I mean in the text editor you can't make a fun bold or change its font family or do anything like that a good example of a text editor where you can format is Microsoft Word what you want to use is something like notepad without any of those options there's loads of free text editors that have more advanced tools on the internet one that I like is called brackets and that's free however for the purpose of this tutorial we're just going to use notepad because we're going to do just a few simple tags so okay well forgot e we've got a P tag which is a paragraph tag so we've got the open angle bracket the P closed angle bracket we've got our text in between and then we've closed our tag off with the open angle bracket before would slash the P and a closed angle bracket so what we'd say is that this text here is wrapped within this P tag that's how we'd say and so if someone said to you hey can you wrap this sentence in an H tag you know what to do you put the H opening tag put the sentence and then you put the H closed Tagg so if we were to save this which I already have done and then display it in a browser what we're going to see is this and you might be like well let's just text well yeah I mean that's what a paragraph text a paragraph tag does it displays text to the user I mean that's what a paragraph is right however if we were to change this to a h1 and we'll do that right now and save it I'm just pressing ctrl s by the way and then we'll refresh this browser and lo and behold we've got a heading and that's because the browser is saying well look you've written h1 so I know this is a heading so I'm going to make this big and I'm going to make this bold so that people viewing this website they know it's a heading two and that's what browsers do they come with these default rules and styles so depending on what tag you use it displays it in a different way so we've got these tags there's more to it however now then tags can contain what's called attributes and attributes just think of them as a way of telling tags more information about that tag all right and they're a thing that you're just going to have to learn I mean it would take me forever to go through every attribute that a tag could have and not every tag can have every attribute different tags have different attributes but there are a few global ones that every tag can have so I give a few examples and an attribute works like this you do get tag name in a space and then your attribute name in this case we'll do class that's a global attribute that can be applied to any tag whatsoever in HTML let me do an equal sign and you do some quotes and then you put the value of your attribute in the quotes and right now you don't need to worry about what this attribute means because I'm going to go over some specific attributes the class included in later tutorials all right just know for now that an attribute is just the attribute name then an equal sign their quotes and then you put the value of your attribute in the quotes all right another example and by the way you can give multiple attributes to an element or a tag so another example would be style and we're waivering into the realms of CSS here and by the way this is quite bad practice you wouldn't normally put a style attribute in a tag itself that's called inline styling and it's frowned upon these days and because you want to keep all of your styles in your cascading style sheet but for the perfect purpose of this example we'll go ahead and use it nice pop style color colon read and save this let's take a look at this this turn red and I just you done that VA via a style attribute in the h1 tag so just remember for now that attributes can be used within tags to give it more information and we'll go through some specific examples later all right so we've got attributes we've got and I'm just going to delete these attributes for now in fact so we've got tags we've got attributes in the tags and we've got the different styles in the browser depending on the tag we use now then if you wanted to you know make for example a bit of this text you want to emphasize it in some way or other okay so say we want to emphasize this portion of the text right here okay we can nest another tag within the h1 tag and we do that by just opening our tap and using the tag name and then closing the tag at the end of the text and notice we've opened within the h1 so we close within the h1 well all right so this en tag what does that mean well it means we're just emphasizing the text that's contained within the am tag all right so let's save this and see what it does so you can see we've still got this h1 and then right about here it goes into italic form and that's the browser saying okay well it wants to emphasize this particular part of the text to the user so we'll do it for it and you can control the way this is emphasized vs CSS but that's a totally different course so we can nest tags within other tags and we can do it even deeper if we wanted to say we wanted to make this particular work bold we can nest another tag within the e/m tag we're going to use one called strong this time we'll close though and neat in this up a little bit so notice again we've opened the strong tag within the e/m tag so we close it within the EM tag as well but save this out and refresh and I've I done something wrong it's all going to be bold because it's a h1 but if we take it change these to a P a paragraph and save that again you can see now we've got the paragraph text this is still all italics because it's still being emphasized by the browser and then we've got this one word paragraph in the strong tag here which is bold all right so what else we'll do one more thing and that is indentation so say for example we've got loads of different tags okay and they're all nested within each other now you can imagine that pretty soon it's going to get illegible it's going to be hard to read for you when you go back to your web page and for other coders who are making edits to your web page so say we've got this for example and you may not know these tags yet I'm just doing this for the purpose of this demonstration just going to use a series of div tags then we use a P tag maybe in fact no we won't we use an a tag change it up a little bit and this H ref by the way you've guessed it is an attribute we'll just leave that blank for now and we're going to cover H references later and link tags so we'll put a link in there and then I've even lost cat family F used for so we'll cause for div tags because they're all nested within each other and yep I've made a mistake there we go so right I'm looking at that and this is what four levels deep and in typical websites things go maybe 10 15 20 layers deep alright so you can imagine how difficult it gets to look at this and think ok well where is the end tag for this if it's in a way over here somewhere or where is the start tag for this you know how to work we're doin s this next element it's going to get really difficult so what we do we do this thing called indentation and there's a general rule of thumb if you're nesting tags within other tags what we tend to do is indent them so we present this like this let me just give a line break after every tag first of all go ok so we put them on different lines first of all and that's still a little bit illegible you still have to kind of work it out where this div tag ends and you have to count down 3 and ends on this row here so what we tend to do is indent every layer we go in so we'll do that too and we'll do this 3 and we'll do this 4 and then we do the same for the closing brackets the closing tags by the way sorry one more and so now we can see that okay well this developments here and it ends there this div opens here and there opens here ends there and so forth so it's a lot easier to read this and I will be honest notepad goes a bit crazy when it indents I mean it doesn't need to be indented this much and if you get a HTML text editor from the web that would normally maybe indent it by something that seems like this much each level something like that okay but you get the idea we just indent them so then we can easily see where the tacks start and where the end so let's just have a quick summary right then so we've already said that hTML use these tags to present content and tags start with an open angle bracket you have the tag name then the closed with a closed angle bracket you put your content and then you close the tag off always at the end with an open angle bracket /the tag name and a clothes hanger bracket and pretty much anything that you're going to use in HTML is controlled this way with tags all right so there's also many different kinds of tags you've already seen have used the P tag to display normal text we've got an h1 tag tag to display headings we've got a an e/m tag that we've used to kind of emphasize things we've got a strong tag to make something bold etc etc there's loads of tags depending on what content you want to display to the user next thing tags can contain attributes and there's many different attributes that's one of those things you're just going to have to learn and we're going to cover some on the way through this course but there are literally tons of attributes and you're going to have to go out there and maybe look at different ones and whatever the attribute is however we always display it this way we open the angle bracket put the element name of the tag name a space then we put the attribute name in this case I put class the equal sign then the quotations then you put your value of the attribute within the quotations all right so tags can be a text can also be nested within other tags and we saw that by nesting the e/m and the strong tags within the P tag before all right what else tags are normally indented when they're nested for readability and we've just literally done that with the div tags so you can see that it's going to be loads easier to read for you in the future when you come to edit your page and other code is when they're indented alright so that's pretty much it for this lesson and in the next lesson we're going to start creating a web page and you're going to start seeing results pretty soon and yeah it's gonna be fun so I'll see you guys then you
