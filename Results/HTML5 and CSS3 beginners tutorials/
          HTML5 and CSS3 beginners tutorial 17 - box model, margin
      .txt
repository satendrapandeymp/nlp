hey YouTube how's it going its Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number 17 and in this tutorial we are going to continue talking about the CSS box model and in particular we are going to talk about the margin property and this is actually going to be the last video on the box model so if you guys are tired of this subject then you've got something to look forward to because we're going to finish it now okay so if you guys don't know where this code comes from or where this code comes from its from the previous two tutorials so you might want to go back and watch those and then come back and watch this video that would probably be a better choice for you but if you guys have watched those videos then let's continue okay so like I told you guys in two videos ago the margin is basically the white space around the outside of our element okay so the space between the side of our browser and where my element actually starts and the space between the top of the browser where my element starts okay so let's go back to CSS and change this up a little now all we have to do to work with margins is actually just type in the margin property and then we just go ahead and give it a size so it works exactly like padding in that sense so we go ahead and just put 50 pixels and now when we go back here and click refresh we have 50 pixels of space on the top 50 pixels of space on the left and on the right and if there were two of these elements we would have 50 pixels of space on the bottom as well so better yet let's go back here and I'm just going to place my cursor right over there and I'm going to push ctrl D and that duplicates that line so now we should have two elements so when we go back and click refresh now we have 50 pixels of space between these two elements as well okay so that's just something neat that you guys can use from now on but let's go back here and change this margin to zero pixels okay now you might think when I click refresh my element would be touching the side but as you can see there's a little bit of space on the side here and there's a little space on the top as well and that's because our body tag itself so this tag over here also actually has a margin and a padding that we would have to get rid of so if you guys want to go ahead and do that then you can just select the body tag just like that and then what you can do is just go ahead and set that margin to zero pixels and for good measure let's just set the padding to zero pixels and then we'll be able to get rid of that margin so go back and click refresh and it's gone so now everything is all touching each other okay okay so I just had to do that in case any of you clever people wanted to try using a margin of zero pixels but let's go back there and talk a little bit more about margins okay and again this is going to work exactly like padding did so we could go ahead and individually put in a margin on the top and then again set another margin on the bottom and so forth so margin top margin bottom and I can't spell today so I am useless but okay we could go ahead and do that very tedious very time-consuming or we could just go ahead and use that shortcut for padding that I showed you guys which would just be margin and then we could go ahead and put in all four values in a line just like we did with padding in the previous two videos I guess okay so zero pixels would be top so it goes top right bottom left just remember that so let's just make a comment on the side here as well just so that nobody forgets so top right bottom and lift and then we can go ahead and just put in let's say ten pixels on the top 30 pixels on the right bottom let's say 60 pixels not that we're really going to see it and then mmm let's go 100 pixels on the left so we should get quite a big space on the left now and now when we go ahead and click refresh you can see we've got 100 pixels of space here 10 pixels here and then on the bottom we've actually got I think that was 60 was it not yeah 60 on the bottom and then what was that 30 on the right okay so that's just how margins work and I hope this concludes the box model for you guys I hope you guys understand the full box model now and you guys can go out and just make boxes all over your website with all sorts of elements so don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys next time
