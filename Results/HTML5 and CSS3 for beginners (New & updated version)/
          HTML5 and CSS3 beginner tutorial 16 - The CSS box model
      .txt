hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 16 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about the CSS box model so if you guys didn't know this you're now going to know right so everything in HTML is actually a box if I take a look at this code in my browser by the way I've got the same paragraph as the previous tutorial I've also got the same CSS as the previous tutorial and if I take a look at this in the browser at normal size it should look something like this but I just want to zoom in real quick and let's talk about this element right so every single element not only paragraphs but every single element in HTML can be seen as a box right and that means that our box can have something called a margin which is spacing on the outside of the box then we can also have a border which would be the line where our box obviously begins and then we have something called padding which is on the inside of our box the best way to actually see this visually is if you right-click on the elements and if you're using default Firefox you can inspect element if you are using Chrome there should be a button called inspect but I've got an add-on for my firefox called Firebug if you are not using it you definitely should install it it's really great and I'm going to say inspect elements and that opens up an element inspector alright but if I go to layout take a look at that that is our box and the more you hover over certain places of this box you can see it it highlights those in the background so we've got something called a margin which like I said is spacing on the outside of our box and in fact this might be easier to see if I go all the way back to 100% so we've got spacing on the outside of the box then we've got padding which is spacing on the in side of the box right now that set to zero and we've also got a border which right now is also set to zero so you can't actually see that but as you add these attributes in or these values in you will actually be able to see them right so let me jump back over to my CSS file and instead of just trying to show you guys in the browser what they look like let's actually make a visual change that you can see so like I said we've got something called a border now border has very many properties that you can alter you can alter the border left the border right the width of the border all these kinds of things but to quickly show you guys something I'm going to just use the border shortcuts or the border shorthand property which we did speak about shorthand properties in the past and border the shorthand property requires three values well doesn't it doesn't require all of them but I'm going to use three values and the first one is the width of the border so I'm going to say 4 pixels and that is just how big our border actually is then the next one is the border type so I'm going to set this to solid but you could also use dotted dashed and there are a bunch of other values so just go ahead and Google what all the values are you will find a website that will give you all the values but I'm going to use solid and then for the last value I'm going to pick a color so if you don't put the color in here by default it will choose the same color as the text that's inside the box so because our text is that slight red color if I don't place in a color it will just by default use that red as you can see so now we've got a paragraph with a border around it and I'm going to maybe just change the color here to green so that it's a little bit more visible and then because I told you guys there's a lot of values here that used dashed instead of solid and take a look at what that looks like so now we have a dashed green border going around our red paragraph and you'll notice that the border is actually going all the way to the end of the browser so it's not just encasing the text it's actually going all the way to the end of the browser and this is because there are things called block level elements and then there are things called inline elements and that is like a whole other tutorial on its own maybe in the next video I'll talk to you guys about that but for right now the reason why this this border goes all the way to the end is because this is a block level element all paragraphs are block level elements alright so now that we've got the border done let's take a look at something called padding and padding is the spacing on the inside of our box so if I increase padding from what is now the default was zero let's increase that to 20 pixels this is going to sit 20 pixels of padding on the top the bottom the left and the right of our box and so now if I come back here and hit refresh you can see that we now have 20 pixels of space up here 20 pixels of space between the border and the text of you here and then 20 pixels of space between the text and the bottom border right and then we would have 20 pixels of space over here if our text went all the way to the end and you can also take a look at that visually if we jump back over to my element inspector and you can see everywhere that it's purple that is our padding everywhere where we've got this yellow that is our margin and then this black line over here oh it's green now but when I hover over border and it has a black line now that black line is our border right so now we've talked about padding and borders let's talk about margin and probably some of you guys are already going to be asking but why is there a margin there already because we haven't actually set a margin yet but you can see the yellow spacing is a margin right so the thing with that is every element has default styling in a browser and it just so happens that Firefox by default will style paragraphs to have 36 pixels of margin around a paragraph but I can change that so let's go margin and I'm going to set this equal to let's do something big like a hundred pixels right come back here and hit refresh and now you can see I've got according to my element inspector over here I've got a hundred pixels of margin all the way around my element and you can see that as well so we've got 100 pixels of space yeah 100 pixels of space there 100 pixels of space on the bottom which means if I ever copy this paragraph and place another paragraph a second now whatever let's not worry about fixing typos second Pera right ah let's come back here and hit refresh and now you can see that there's also a hundred pixels of margin between these two paragraphs as well and yeah basically there's 100 pixels all the way around right now some of you guys might also be asking ok well what the heck if I come back yet what the heck shouldn't there be a hundred pixels of spacing on the bottom of this pair off and then 100 pixels of spacing on the bottom of the second paragraph meaning that this space should be a lot bit bigger it should be double the size it is now and that the reason why that doesn't happen is because there's something called margin collapse or collapsed margins so margin well I don't think that's an attribute we can alter but basically what happens here is elements collapse margins so that you don't whenever you put in a value it creates the same the same margin all the way around instead of doubling the space if that's I hope that makes sense right so something else I want to show you guys is that we can have different padding's and margins and borders on all different sides of our element so if I let's just comment this this text out so if I comment all of that out and we style our element again I can have a border on the top of our element and that can be solid or four pixels solid black I can also have a border on the right of our element or of our paragraph and that can be two pixels I think there's a value called out set for borders as well there's inset and outset and I'm going to set that equal to red we can also have border bottom border left so go ahead and play around with that if you like padding we can also have different values for padding we can have padding top of something like 20 pixels and then padding right of something like actually I shouldn't be using right let's use it's going to be easier to see 30 pixels all right let's actually make that a little bit bigger 50 pixels and then margin as well we can have margin top of something like 30 pixels and then a margin right of something like well let's use left again sorry a margin left or something like 80 pixels right and then that will allow us to have different sizes on on each side right so looking at this again I've got a four pixel border on the top that is black I've got a what is that two pixel border on the right that is red and it is very hard to see unless i zoom in you'll be able to see that right then we've also got 20 pixels of padding on the top we've got 50 pixels of padding on the Left we've got margins 30 pixels and 80 pixels so the margin has 30 pixels of space on the top and then 80 pixels of space on the left so you can go ahead and play around with these values there are also shortcuts to this as well so I showed you the border shortcut which was that but then we've also got padding shortcuts which instead of going padding left padding top padding right padding bottom you can just type in padding as a shortcut and then give this values top it would be top right bottom left so always remember when using shortcuts that it would be top right bottom and left and I'm going to give this padding of 40 pixels on the top 100 pixels on the right 60 pixels on the bottom and 200 pixels on on the left right and by the way margin would work exactly the same way so if I change this to margin we could change the values as well but let's come back here and hit refresh and now you can see we've got these paragraphs pretty much in the middle of nowhere it would be a lot easier to see visually if I had a border but you can also take a look at this in the element inspector and I've got 40 pixels on the top margin 200 pixels on the left 100 pixels on the right and 60 pixels on the bottom which is exactly what I put over here right and the same thing that was margin and the same thing for padding 40 pixels on the top 200 pixels on the left 100 pixels on the right and 60 pixels on the bottom if you just hover over this you'll be able to see that right so that is all I have for you guys in this video I hope the box model is now clearly explained and you guys know how to use the shortcuts and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now what you're still here
