hi everyone this is Matthew Kaufman with tech urchin comm and in this tutorial we're going to be learning how to change some fonts and text size in the previous tutorial we played with some color and some basic formatting and I briefly mentioned changing fonts here I'm going to tell you exactly how to change those fonts so let's go ahead and setup our HTML page just same as before I'm gonna move a little quickly through this because we've done it in the previous tutorials so I'm not gonna take a lot of time to show you how to do this tutorial for all right and we're gonna work in the body okay and we're just going to set up a couple lines here first line we're gonna set up as kind of a a gauge so we understand what's going on we're just gonna say all right and this just gonna shows it this is our line that's not formatted let's if you save it hop on over give it a load and there we have first line of text no formatting all right let's go ahead and put in a page break so that we put this on a separate line and we're going to throw in another line this is our second line of text new fonts now with this line of text we're going to change the font we want something other than the the stapled Times New Roman that it's going to be shown as as we see here it's the same thing as what it's always been so we're gonna use the the font tag as we've used before we used it for color we use font color and then we designated a color here we're gonna use font face and that's gonna designate this specific type of font that we're using so let's go ahead and do something different something that we haven't seen before like Verdana and as we did in the with color we do put for Donna in quotes now for the end tag and make sure you save it up over to your browser give it a load and there we have it in the verdana type and Verdana font okay so let's say we wanted to do Comic Sans because everybody loves to use Comic Sans and now that tricky thing with Comic Sans it does end in MS it's not just Comic Sans you might have to look up some of the font names and that might be something valuable to check in and learn on now notice it there is a little bit of a difference on our sizes in the text and let's say say we're doing it another line at X let's say 3rd line this is our third line of text nice asses make sure you put a page break in there I almost forgot - and it would make it quite muddled yeah that is safe but never give a load and here we have our third line of text let's say we want to we want to put a new size on there we want to make it kind of try to at least match the top one we're gonna use the font tag again and instead of font face we're gonna use font size and I'm gonna use equals and in quotes you're gonna put a numerical figure here in order to try to match it so let's say font size - and close it off and give that a safe hop on over give it a reload and that's quite a bit smaller so let's try font size 4 maybe save that back over and that looks about right it looks a little bit larger than our original size and so you can play around with these sizes for a while try to get something that you're looking for let's say go in for a title and you want it nice and big maybe not that big but you can you can make them as large as you want as small as you want and that could be extremely useful when you're trying to change the sizes up on your on your fonts now one thing to to take note of is if you want to do a new font type with the font face and you also want to do a font size you don't have to do separate font tags you can just put it all under one font tag so like let's go back up to our second line here and we have font face Comic Sans let's go ahead and make this different size so we're just gonna put size equals and let's make it size 5 you can give that a save hop over give it a load and then we have a size 5 Comic Sans line and if you want to go even farther we can even change the color so color equals red and give that a save hop over and there we have a red comics and size 5 and that's going to be basically it with it's a fun sizing and discipline types you can play around with that some more play around with different different font types and different fun faces different sizes different colors and if you need to know do a review on how to do the colors you can go back to the previous tutorial and that'll give you a real quick run-through and you can play around with some more specific colors with the the hexadecimal color system man that's all I have for you in this tutorial come back for more
