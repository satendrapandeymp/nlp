hello everyone and welcome back to another video brought to you by webbed cuts calm this is a video 29 h2 more training series and in this video we'll be learning about how to use table layouts to create a website now this video is going to be kind of long because we're actually going to create a website together I'll already have a website pre-made that we're going to make the other let me go ahead and open that up real quick um this is the website that I made it took me about ten minutes to make something like that what we're going to do is use a table for the layout they'll hold all of our content in and all of our sections and for each row on our table is going to be something different for instance this row will be in the banner this row will be the content and this row will be the footer of the website as you can see the banner right here is title of the sighs Brad wound which that's a pretty cool name we have some content right here and this column right here and then we have some links to other pages and our sites right here but actually these links go to the same exact page of index dot whatever this one is right here but this is like the basic structure of practically every web page I may not look exactly like this like they might not have a column right here for links but they might have like a row right here for links but for this one this is just a pretty simple little website you guys can make and I hope you guys enjoyed this video cuz it's going to take a while to record this I'll probably be exhausted by then in this video so let's go ahead and begin making this layout right here I'm just going to just go ahead and fall with me uh practically all the code that I'm going to write you guys probably know almost all of it or most of it if not all of it alright so the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead code our table so let's go ahead and type in table and put a closing table tag and let's hit tab because we want our code to be spaced out and clean looking and we're going to make three rows so let's go ahead and make TR and the fit cut make another TR and then we're going to do is just copy the code hit enter twice and then make another row and then make another row and these are going to be separated between this is going to be the banner row this is going to be the row that holds the columns for our content and this is going to be the footer and as you can see this would be the banner row this is a Content row and this is the footer row right here and now we have to put our columns and these rows since if you make a row you have to put a column there and the tag for column is TD let's go ahead and make it like that oops that's not how you make that and this will be our columns right here and we're going to go ahead and copy this column and we're gonna go down to this row right here then between the two row tags right here in the middle and copy we're do it twice in this row I'll show you later what we're going to do since this only has one row in this the only hat and this has two rows and then going on the footer row and just make one column right there since this one has two columns these two rows right here have to also have two columns but there's one thing we can do to over UM to pass that um exception I guess you'd call it or to go around that and what we can do is on our road tag on our footer and our banner row tag right here we're gonna call these or give these IDs later we can make D this column span across two columns and in order for us to do on our row we have to type in actually one second no on our column I'm sorry about that this is just a long video I can remember many things on this row we have the right call span Co L span and is going to do is just span this row or this column across two columns we're going to define two columns one second and like I said it's going to expand this calm across two columns so it's like two columns wide basically or it's like putting two columns and just making it one big column that's basically all it does and we're going to give this to this column two down here and they this the footer row down here and that is basically the basics for the table so far with the tables columns and rows we're gonna do now is actually start giving these rows some names and making them look good all right now let's go ahead and give this a border of one well you don't have to I'm gonna show you what looks like so far as you can see it's just a little table because we haven't done any styling to it we haven't defined a width or height of the table yet yet so I don't have to do is go into our CSS right here and start writing all of our styles actually but before we do that let's just give these IDs real quick well Cody IDs and a CSS and one minute this content the top row will be called a banner give an ID of banner the middle row will be given an ID of content and then this the last row will be given a ID of footer this is just going to help us remember which row is which the first thing that we need to do is give the table some characteristics and we're going to do is just to find how big the table is going to be and we're going to put a different kind of border on the table just like in this one right here I think so we have a black border going around the table right here it's kind of hard to see because we have a dark color right down here but it's actually going above this little green no put this right here there we go I have a border going around the entire table just makes the site look a little bit better and so let's go ahead and code that right now to need to do border I don't think we've ever learned about the border yet so what you have to do is when you make a border on something you have to define the border right here and then how thick you want your border to be so one pixel but we're not going to put a semicolon right there yet we're actually have to put space and we have to give it a little bit more information there's different types of borders you can put on your table or put a border around anything they're solid there's dotted lines and there's some others I forget what they're called right now but the kind of border that we want is just like this one and I have a solid border on this so what I want to do is type in solid to let this know that we're going to put a solid border around and then after that we have to define which color we want the border and black is the border color that we want so he goes border with what kind of border do you want on it and then the color of the border and then if we test this now it'll put a little black box right here this because of stuffing goes in the width and height of it yet but let's go ahead and get this video moving along I want to be Wow well I got a proof we got to prove for 15 minute long video or longer than 15 minutes ago so I guess it doesn't matter how long City was but uh and now what we have to do is define the height of the table and the width I want our website to be about where did I make this one I think this is about 600 pixels so we're gonna make the height of the table to be about 600 pixels and that gives us a pretty good little size the website just likes this one right here and then our width will be let me check where out with it was about 300 I put all right the width of the table will also be 600 pictures doesn't look like a boss so basically we have an 8 box as the column is the holder container of the sites that's not look like it's a 600 by 600 if you look at it okay if you look at like sideways it looks even and notice how our table is on the left-hand side of the screen well we want to fix that real quick and let me get all these out of the way there's a way we can do this and well there's one way we can do it I know you can do just go ahead and type it I type margin-right:auto and margin-left:auto typing these two codes and we'll actually Center your table there's an easier way to actually Center the table but it's kind of a defecate deprecated way of doing it that means it's not really supported much anymore and it's kind of an old kind of way to do it but this is basically the newest way and the best way to Center our tables the other way was actually to go into the table and align it to Center but you really don't want to do that that's a really bad programming uh coding practice as they say it and you really want to get the habit of doing that all the time so we're going to do margin left margin right Auto this is going to Center our table right now as you can see the table is now centered since those two styles are put in and it's looking a lot like this now and I just closed that off how just reload it back and that is looking I mean let's run this again all right so our table is looking a lot like that one of Brad land so let's go ahead and start coding oh you like that all right let's go ahead and start coding our banners content and the footer rows real quick so let's go ahead and since this banner is in a table or a table row I'd say we're gonna go ahead and just write table rail and we learned about compound styling and a couple of videos ago one thing I need to point out is that you shouldn't put a space in between like the ID names I had a space between last time but I think you're supposed to put it with no spaces but it worked last time so I'm not really sure haven't really found an answer but uh I guess it's best to not use any spaces once you have an ID after but if you're using tags like that then you have to put a space but if it's ID or class you're putting it right after the main selector then you don't have to put a space it's probably not recommended to put a space that's just a little tidbit for you so we're going to change the banner row right now and I'm going to go ahead and give that row a background color of green and go ahead and load this up alright we have a back on color of a green but if you look at the other the brad'll and that green heading is a little too big so we're going to do is give it a height of about I think it was about 150 150 pixels and if we load that back up it shrinks a little bit and it's looking still a bit bigger I think is about 100 actually I can't not 1,500 and this will actually give us the look of what Bradley looks like all right so we got that styling out and what we're going to do is come down here into our body and we're actually going to write what our banner is going to say so we'll put a h1 tag right there since it's pretty important and we're going to write the name of our website and I won't make Brad land again and so as I'm going to put H Brad land an h1 tag right into the banner row and we're going to go ahead and style that since I only have one h1 tag probably only one actual tag inside of this banner right right here we're going to go ahead and style the text through here we're gonna give it every text on there so we're gonna make it white and let's see what that looks like and that's looking pretty good right now you can see it's pretty close to what it looks like right now we'll change the font family of it later I'm gonna show you an easy way how to define all the fonts than the entire page but we'll do that in just a moment now what we need to do is since we've have configured all the banner styling so we're going to go ahead and do the content stylings so since content is a row TR your table row and then type in contents as we're going to change the content of our page and now we're going to do is actually I'm Taylor i'ma Taylor my code Oh quick okay I've said now I keep forgetting what I've typed in the code so now we're actually making the table row content 400 pixels that's a pretty good sized layout for the content a lot of room to leave for like putting text on your web page and everything and that's looking pretty good right now you won't be able to see it on here but it's actually there let's go ahead and style the footer we'll go back to the table in a minute or a table of content a table row content a minute so I'm going style the footer real quick and we're going to footer a height of since we have 4 pixels for this row and 100 pixels for this row we're gonna give 100 pixels to the footer so 100 pixels to the footer and then take a look at this we have a background color with black and the color of the text is white and as you notice it is centered I want to show you how to do that also so what the background color of this section to be black what a black colored footer and now what we're going to do is once secondly look at my code quick okay I see it what we're going to do now is define that we want the text actually let's put the text in there first I'll make a lot easier copy alright so we're going to footer and we're going to change the text with the footers what the footer sets so copyright 2011 where I had to land all rights reserved that's not what the other one says but you can put anything you want in it doesn't really matter so we're banging our Styles right now and what we need to do is make this texture here white so what we're going to do is make everything in the footer all the text in the footer to be white since we have a black background and once we load the page up as you can see the background is now black and the color of the Texas white as you can see the text is not centered and there is a way to make it centered and what we have to do is go right here and the styling and type in text-align:center what this is going to do is just basically Center the text horizontally or no yes horizontally house getting vertical and horizontal views from that what is going to put it right in the center of that or right there so again if we load the page up refresh it the text is now centered in that row and it's looking really good now and it's looking just like this one right here except for the font family but we're going to change the font family and a little bit later we're going to apply it to everything on the webpage in one simple command so now that's looking pretty good let's go ahead and let's write the content of our sites so let's go ahead to the content row inside the first column I won't put a h2 tag at their closing also and we're going to write welcome to red land or whatever you named your site and we'll put exclamation point right there and then we're going to put a paragraph after that and we're going to say like I'm gonna say Mike my sites about computer pairing so inputs Brad land is your place for place for 100% professional computer repair and web design I'll do that too as an exactly stable it on this one what everybody's matter or design we will make your computer run so that it blows up so that's pretty fast if it blows up and if we refresh the page content comes on the page and everything looks kind of weird right now but we'll change that in one second and then let's go ahead and put our links onto the second column this column right here is going to hold all of our links that we have right here and how we're going to do the links is that we're going to put them see they're in a list right now so we're going to put them in the unordered list so let's write ul and let's proposing ul right here and then when we're making lists we have to put Li for each list item that we have that we're going to make so we have ul we're making an unordered list and then let's go ahead and copy this a few times about copy and paste it about three more times so that you have four lists list items right there and we're gonna make about four links on our sites and just write something in like computer repair um web design let's see what's another one our prices and then about us and this will be the links that will appear on the right side of the page that's going to appear right here and so once we refresh the page that we're making as it looks you kind of weird right now that's cuz we haven't put any styles on the inner contents right here so that's what we're going to do now is put it the contents styling now so let's go back up here and let's take a look at this right real quick and let's look at these other one as you can see on this one the text is actually at the top of this row right here and as you can see on this one it's about in the center so we're on to do that and we're happy to put this border right here this right border that separates the right side of the page from the left and we're actually have to actually define the widths of each of these columns so that this one's bigger than this one over here so that's the stylings that we have to apply on this and what we're going to do is on these table columns are here or in each give one of these a clot Raa ID so this will be the right side column and this will be the left column right here so let's go ahead and make those in our CSS so we'll do TR content since we're in the content and then we'll do right actually let's do left first and we're going to style the left side of that content or the left column content and inside the content so we'll make the width we'll make them with about 70% so 70% of that of that row will be for that one column since we're going to give it an ID in one second and then to make our text go at the top of the at the top of the row right here but there's one command that we have typed in and that is vertical-align:top and that's going to outline the text and the content to the top of the page instead of the middle and now let's go ahead and make these stylings for the right side column so do with as about 30% and then with you vertical-align:top for that also so now if we refresh the page hmm it's not working that's because we didn't put the IDS on there yet I kind of freak me out there for a minute so let's go ahead and put this as the left column and we'll give this column the idea of right since it's the right column now when we refresh the page it'll actually not style it still what is going on let's do only my code real quick I really don't want to restart this video right now for a : top okay I see what we have to do what we have to do is actually put TD right there to make it say like okay when it's in the row and now if we put this refresh this page it'll actually do it now because last time we didn't define that it's in a TD 22 row or not caught I keep me calm row next up but when it's in a column then do this so every row not every row every column named left that's in the content row put this on there that's what it's doing kind of get a little mixed up this is already a long video um what we're gonna have to do now is this is looking a lot like this but there's a couple things we need to do we need to make these links and we have to put a bar right here a border and another thing I'd to do is make all this Arial font so we're had to do now is on this right here the left column rather give it a border right attribute or a fruit what's calling CSS but uh we're given the border right attribute I think it's color the border right style and all this does is that it gives the right-hand side border the styling it won't give any other border like the top left or the bottom any styling at all so I had to put just like the other border up here one pixel solid black that's exactly we're going to put in this one pixel solid black and now it'll put this black border right here on our web page the next thing we need to do is make these links which that's very simple to do always said to put them is is in the eight tag so we'll do a and then hypertext reference index dot HTML or just actually will this one's Khalil the HTML whichever file name you're using right now the closing a tag and then we'll just put the this link on every single one of these you can project copy and paste but we're gonna type them all real quick just do that for all of them takes a while to type all these lay out the HTML that a traffic goes well whoops way out stage to mow and now we are done typing all that so now we have our links over here that actually are real links now go ahead and refresh this these are now real links as you see there's one more thing we need to do the reason these are Purple's because there I've already clicked on them for Coyle knees and it blows up oh I have this layout's it doesn't matter as long as you point it back to the same file it should work but I put this as layout dice time on the set of layouts that HTML the next thing we need to do is make all this fonts Arial there's one little thing you can do to do that really quick and your CSS styles right above table go ahead and put the asterisk right there and this what this is going to do is this means apply to everything so it's going to apply to everything on the entire page no matter what so we're going to give everything the font family of Arial and that's that's all it is it just applies to everything gives everything an entire webpage the font-family:arial and if you load up our page everything is an Arial font now thanks that little CSS styling now if you notice there are some little white spaces right here like around this but on this one it doesn't there's no white spaces around the border or like around the border of this agreeing so in order for us to actually get rid of that it's just one simple styling thing you have to do in the table CSS you have to do border spacing I think it's a zero and that will get rid of the white spaces around anything inside of your table so now this is looking just like this that's what we wanted and you have just completed your first website your little first web page and actually everything is looking pretty good and right here so if you follow it along you should have came up with something similar or the same exact thing of what this looks like right here um I took a little long cuz I had to explain everything I think this videos like sodium minutes long that's a pretty long video so well at least you learned how to do the laid out of your website of a basic website I hope you guys enjoy this video hope you guys are pretty happy that you made your first like website I can put anything on there basically and you can just change the styles to what your styling what
