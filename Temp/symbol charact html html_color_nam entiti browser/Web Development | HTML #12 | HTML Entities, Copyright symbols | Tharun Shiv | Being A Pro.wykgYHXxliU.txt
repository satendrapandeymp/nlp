hey everyone I'm Tara we're back again with a cool tutorial so in the previous tutorial we talked a lot of things but it was just a short video and now we're going to move on with hey Simon entities okay so what are we waiting for let's get right in the tutorial so let's just open up our workspace okay so we have this I just put on this hast one HTML entities here in this paragraph Kate it so let me just start type in here so what are they stable entities HTML entities are those small symbols or the trademark you'd have seen the trademark those copyright symbols right so how do you write that with HTML that's what I'm going to show you now it lets mourn with it so to rank those what do you do is just go inside a P tag or h1 you could write it within the span also okay so how do you write it so to write little entity you would have to write ampersand okay and you have a specific code for each symbol you want to use for example if we want an ampersand say look let if you just save this here we get the ampersand but this is not actual way of writing the ampersand okay let me just always anon oh sorry it's not here here is written here see here we get the understand this is not the way you write to a person if I write a MP and a semicolon here you get an ampersand this is the way to write a good ampersand okay now what are the other other symbols we have for example amplifier and C will be Y okay see you get a copyright symbol okay and one of the other thing you could write you are you can say you entity so there are a lot of HTML entities but I have like few covered in here let me just show you immediately so having table here let me just paste the table oh I missed the table let me just quickly fetch the table from here it's a habit stable when I say this we get them let's just quickly revise our table styling skills and let's make it good for our friends it is go to tighten up CSS and just come down let's quickly we'll start writing our table rules remember in this table and now the first thing you want to use we're gonna give the border border let's give one pixel solid and white okay save it so we have that what else do we want let's make the color okay color white okay we have that can't have that so what does it mean let's make the boot to 100% here we have the word and font size oh say 30 pixels that was a big so that you could make the difference so what else do we need hmm let me see oh oh that's okay before that let's all eat quickly styler tea heads okay let's give it a border border of one pixel solid white tht our K table row and give it a border border one pixel okay one pixel solid white see so we'll have like that it's our table - sorry it's titi yes cool we have that so let's just border collapse or you could just keep it like that collapse collapse good if we have a table now let's quickly go glance to work with what I have in this table okay so in this table okay I have the work for whatever symbol what are the entities names and what are the entity numbers okay so for this symbol you have to use ampersand that maybe it's like less than okay it is less than they made it everything so that you could remember it properly so for it is simple we know that ampersand a MP we used and for this copyright we didn't ever sign 0py and for this registered trademark with it ampersand r AG he said this is how it worked this is how it works HTML entities so I leave the link down in the description below if you are interested in knowing about more HTML entities and like what are the energy names and numbers you have to use in order to use them in the code okay otherwise that's all for this video guys and see you in the next video next tutorial tiny someone's goodbye [Music]
