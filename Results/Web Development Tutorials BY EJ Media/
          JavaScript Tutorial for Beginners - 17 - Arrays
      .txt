in this video we're going to take a look at arrays now in previous videos we've been creating variables that hold just a single value and if we wanted a bunch of values for dirt roads here we would have to create a variable for each different flavor so in other words we could only hold a single value arrays are just simply variable that allows us to hold multiple values and so instead of having to create a different variable for each one of these values we can put them all into a container and store them into an array it just can hold multiple values so you'll often hear this called an array variable and that's what this is right here roads is our array variable now you define an array using square brackets and you can see those right here and again these contain all these different values and they get assigned to our array variable now in order to reference a value in here arrays use a system called an index and each one of these values has its own index and it always starts at 0 so stone would have an index number of 0 dirt would have an index number of 1 cement would have an index number of 2 and so on and so you get the idea so once again if we had hundreds of values that we need to distort it's a lot easier to put those in an array variable than it is to create different variable for each one of these values now how do we access these values and we do that through the index so if I wanted to access dirt for instance I would use the array name and then the index number which in this case of course is 1 that is how we can access values inside of our array and so how do we use these values well one common way is to assign these values to another variable and so let's do that let's create another variable let's say when you did a variable to create a dirt road in a game we had so we'll create another variable called road traveled and we'll say equals 2 and here is where we specify the array and then what we do is we need to use the square brackets again and then we just specify the index number in here which happens to be 1 for dirt so we put that right here now I should point out also that these are also referred to as elements so this would be element zero this would be element one I like to call them values but again these are also called elements multiple elements make up an array okay so now that we've assigned the value of dirt to our new variable let's go ahead and write this out and so we'll just do a document dot right let's go ahead and save this and we'll go ahead and run it in Chrome as we always do and there you see we get dirt now you might ask the question how do I update an array that is let's say we wanted to change the value of one of these and there is a way to do that so let's say we wanted to change dirt to cobblestone well we could do that by specifying the array name and then the index number and then the new value that you want so I'll show you how we do that so I'll just copy and paste right here because I already had it written out so here we go we specify the array name we're specifying one for this element right here which is dirt and then we're saying hey assign it a new value of cobblestone now if we rerun this we won't get dirt anymore because we reassign the value here in the array to cobblestone and then this now should be written out as cobblestone so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and run it and there you see we get the new update cobblestone which is what we wanted now I should point out that this is not the only way that you have to write out an array and so let me copy and paste this in here and I'm just going to keep this commented out because we're not actually going to run this but here is a different way to create an array now it's doing the same thing as this array up here the only difference is this is considered longhand the longhand way of creating an array this is considered the shorthand and if you take a look at this here we are creating an empty array in the beginning whereas in the shorthand way to do this we're putting all the values inside the array when we create the array here we are just creating an empty array and then we're going to go ahead and assign the values at a later time and you will notice though here that you actually have to specify the index number for each one of these so that's that's different than the shorthand version now some people like this version better because they like to see the index numbers other developers like the shorthand way okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
