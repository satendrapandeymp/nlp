if you have made it this far by now you will have a very good grasp of HTML and CSS now at this point you have two options if you are still interested in learning more about CSS I have created a follow-up series called more on CSS this will be sort of a running series on CSS where I will add new subjects from time to time I have put the link to that series in the description of this video now if you want to start on a new subject you can go ahead and start learning about JavaScript and I've also provided the link to the JavaScript series in the description of this video now after you complete the series for JavaScript you should take the series on jQuery thanks as always for watching
