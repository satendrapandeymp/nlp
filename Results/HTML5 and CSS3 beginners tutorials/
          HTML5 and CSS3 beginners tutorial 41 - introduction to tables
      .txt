hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and this is tutorial number 41 and in this tutorial we are talking about using table elements so you will notice that I have cleared most of the tags out of my body over here and we're working with basically the old template that we used to work with and I also have a blank CSS file so just to let you guys know what we are working with for this tutorial let's get started so the first thing I want let you guys know about tables is that they were only added to CSS or HTML rather so that we as web page designers or developers had some way of displaying data back to the user in a table like form so that the the users could actually read the data or see the data clearly and easily okay but there are some designers that realized in 1997 when tables were introduced into HTML that hey a table can be used to layout your web page because it consists of rows and columns and that's exactly what we want our web pages to look like rows and columns okay so you will notice that there are a lot of older web pages out there or old web designers out there the hat you know obviously learn how to design web pages in the 90s or early 2000s that use tables to lay out their websites and that is completely completely wrong guys you guys should never use a table to layout your web page okay I just wanted to let you guys know that now I have you know before we even get started but I do have tutorials on how to create a web page layout the proper way using div tags and the section tags and all those new tags are you along with CSS and you can create a web page that looks just as good if not so again that is the proper way to do things so let's get started talking about tables now huh and let's actually add a table to our web page so to do that we're going to open up a new tag which is called you guessed it table okay so go ahead and close that off now and now we have a table tag on our web page okay so what do we do with this table now okay and the first thing we're actually going to want to do is at least give the user some idea of what the information is going to be in this table so in other words we want to give our table a caption okay and we could do this by you know adding a heading tag outside of our table but you guys already know how to do that and instead what I'm going to do is show you guys how to use a new tag in tables which is called caption and we're going to go ahead and end that caption tag off over there and what this caption tag does is allow us to basically make a heading or I want to say heading but a caption of what information is going to be displayed in our table okay and a caption tag can only be used inside of a table so don't use it outside the table because that's not proper use but inside the table is fine okay so let's go ahead now and actually give this table a caption and I'm going to create a table that contains the best-selling games worldwide so let's go ahead and actually make that the caption best-selling games world wide hand this is actually according to Wikipedia so that is where I got my information from to Wikipedia just like that you know not that it's reliable anything but I just you know needed some data to you follow table with so that's where I got it from okay and now we can go ahead and actually give our table some columns because you guys know that a table consists of rows and columns so the first thing we have to do is actually make a row and to do that we're going to use a tag called TR and that stands for table row so table row and ending table row now we have one row in our table so we can go ahead and actually add some columns now and the funny thing about tables is that we don't actually have a way to make a column okay but we can make a table cell so in other words row 1 block 1 that actual cell we can make okay and to do that we can go ahead and use a tag called t d and ending TD and that stands for table data and another way we can actually make a table cell is to also use a tag called th okay and th stands for table header so this will actually just be the header of the table okay and the first column that I want in our table is going to be rank so I'm going to go ahead and give that a rank then we can actually duplicate this line by pressing ctrl D and I'm going to give the second column a title of title and that is going to be the title or the game's title that is sold worldwide okay and then we're just going to make one called release year which is the year that the game was released and then we'll also make another column for copies sold so how many copies were sold worldwide okay and if we go ahead and say this and run this in Firefox we should start seeing our table appear so right here we've got our caption best-selling games worldwide according to Wikipedia then we've got our ranked title release here and copies sold but this doesn't look very clear now does it because we've got these headings over here and we've got this caption but we don't actually have any little borders to represent a cell so we can go ahead and fix that up by putting a border in our table so we could go ahead and give this attribute an attribute of border and set that equal to one okay and if we save that now and click refresh we now have some borders appearing and that doesn't look very nice but I'm going to save all the niceties or all the CSS for this table for another tutorial so we will get back to that in the next tutorial but for now let's go ahead and actually add some data to this table so I need to create a new row so TR and ending TR and now we can go ahead and actually fill our row with some data so the first thing we have to do is create or give this table data a rank okay so table data is going to be our first cell and the rank is obviously going to be one because this is our first actual game that we're putting in here so it's going to be the one that's ranked at the top okay then we're going to create another table data and to be honest I think we should just duplicate this a couple times so four okay that's fine so the title of the best-selling game worldwide funny enough is a Tetris and that was released in 1984 and this is according to Wikipedia so you know and it sold 100 and 43 million copies worldwide which is an insane amount of copies believe it or not okay so now we can go ahead and create our second row so TR and ending TR and I'm just going to actually copy all of this I should have copied the row as well but hey okay now the next game is the number two most sold game in the world and believe it or not that is actually Wii Sports I didn't believe that because I didn't think that we sports was that popular and it was released in 2006 and it has sold 81 million or 81 point nine nine million copies okay so I'm going to go ahead and save this right there and refresh this in Firefox and you can see we now have a table that actually looks like a table okay so we've got our caption then we've got our table headers over here and then we also displaying our table data out just like this and this tutorial is actually getting kind of long so I think we'll go ahead and add maybe another two more columns into this table or two more rows into this table and then we'll just end it the tutorial there so the third moment selling game in the world you know which I find to be quite crazy is actually minecraft and that is super insane because it really isn't the best game in the world or most fun game in the world but you know if you guys play minecraft I'm sorry to offend you but I have also played minecraft I've bought it and it's cool but not that cool okay so forty-nine point five million copies of minecraft sold worldwide and let's go ahead and add the fourth-most game fourth most sold game in the world and that happens to be Super Mario Brothers and that I can believe because Super Mario Brothers was really popular and that was released in 1985 and that has sold thirty five point five three million copies which is crazy but let's go ahead now and refresh this and there we go that is our table and we've got a few more rows in there so basically that is how you create a table in HTML and as always guys don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will
