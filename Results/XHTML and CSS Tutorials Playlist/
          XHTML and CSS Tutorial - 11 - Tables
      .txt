what's going on guys welcome back to your 11th XHTML tutorial and in this tutorial I think it's time to start covering tables now what table is is it's an easy way to organize information on your website into rows and columns it might make it easier to read easier to view easier to navigate so if you're familiar with Microsoft Excel at all that's pretty much is program to make tables it's the same concept is like a spreadsheet so if you don't know what table is or you never saw one before then the easiest way to learn is just the watch this tutorial and trust me by the end of it you'll get it like that so the first thing that we need to do in order to create a table is to make our table tags and yes the key word for this is table and the ending tag table so our entire table all of the information is going to go in between these tags so as I said before tables consist of rows and columns now let's go ahead and make a make a table with two rows in order to do this we need the tag TR this stands for a table row and also at an ending TR in everything that goes in between the opening and closing TR tag that's going to be one row of the table so let's go ahead and copy this and paste it and now we have a table with two rows we don't have any information in there but hey we got a table with two rows it's a start so remember earlier I said that tables consist of rows and columns well in order to make a column in your table go ahead and add some space in between your table rows so we have some room to work and you might think that the key word for this is TC but it's not it's actually TD and I believe this stands for table data why they didn't name it column I don't know what would have made a lot more sense but hey you know I don't make the rules they do so anyways TD and also an ending TD maybe it stands for touchdown who know and anything you put inside here is going to show up in that column so let me go ahead and let me go ahead and just copy this so now our first table row has three columns in it so if you copy this and paste it right here so check it out we have a table and it has one row and another row right here and each of these rows have three columns now if you save this and refresh to right now we'd get an empty screen even though we have a table there if we don't have any data inside then nothing is going to show up because it's like a blank table so let's go ahead and add some data um just right you know whatever's on your mind let's see what's on my mind today fish and capital letters must I accidentally hit caps lock arm apples let's see what else tuna thing I must be hungry or something let's see a tuba you know musical ham chops and let's see corn with a question mark like you know you're asking someone a sentence or a question or something who knows whatever six things are on your mind throw in there so let's go ahead and save this and see what we got go ahead and refresh this and you can see that our table now consists of the two rows here is Row one and here's Row two and each of these rows has three columns one two three in the first one one two three and the second one and if you kind of highlight over it you can kind of see the border which brings me to another point um if you don't quite understand yet trust me here's a little attribute that you can add your table to make it a lot more clear or a lot clearer more clear or clear I don't know what the correct term is many ways you see how our table has no borders and the edges are kind of hard to see well table has an attribute called border and you can set it equal to however thick you want the border to be so let's go ahead and just make it 1 pixel thick and save it and check it out we now have a table that's a whole lot easier to see that yes it doesn't fat consists of two rows with three columns in each row so yeah that may be a little bit easier so from now on I'm probably going to add that tribute in the upcoming tutorials just because it makes everything a lot more clear so anyways that is your basics of how to create a table how to create individual rows and columns and in theory you can have as many rows as you want and also as many columns in each row so um yeah that's it and another thing I want to point out before I let you guys go you see that all we did is add text into these columns or table data but you can add anything that you would add in the body for example if I wanted to add an image right here I could add image if I wanted to add a link or a paragraph or a header I could do that so anything that you could add in the body of your website you can add in the table data so that's how you create tables I hope you enjoyed don't forget to stick around for the next couple of toriel's because we are not done with tables yet there's a whole slew of thing as the cover so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
