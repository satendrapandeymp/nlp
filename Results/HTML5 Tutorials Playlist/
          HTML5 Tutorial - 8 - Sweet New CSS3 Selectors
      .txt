welcome ladies and gentlemen to your eighth html5 tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about some new css3 selectors now the first selector I'm going to be talking to you guys about is the greater than sign now the greater than sign pretty much affects the second element where the first element is the parent so what am I talking about well let's go ahead and let me show you guys an example so if I write something like this where it looks like that pretty much this whatever rule I type after here it's going to affect any paragraph that has a div as its parent so if we look all of these paragraphs have a div called mommy as their parent so let's go ahead and apply rule I will go ahead and color this green so now if we go ahead and save this and refresh this page now all of these paragraphs since they had a div as their parent get colored green never saying okay well does that work with a grandparent as well because check this out the div is its parent in the body is its grandparent so let's go ahead and exchange the four body and see what happens we go ahead and refresh this and nothing gets affected that's because the body is not the parent of the paragraph the body is the grandparent of the paragraph and this symbol right here means only affect the paragraphs where body are the parent make sense good so now with that saw 'real or excuse me not that or that isn't the end of the story so now with that rule taken care of we can move on to the other rule which is the plus sign now the plus sign is another new selector that we got with css3 and it pretty much means effect the second element when it immediately follows the first so that's kind of weird and another thing is that they must have the same parent so what the heck am I talking about say we have a paragraph that belonged to the class of Bucky now all of these paragraphs belong to the class Bucky so I'm just going to go ahead and write Bucky plus paragraph so this is saying okay and what color cannot make this did I make the last one green I'll make this one blue so this is pretty much saying okay whenever we have a paragraph that follows another paragraph with a class Bucky turn it blue so let's go ahead and save this refresh it and see what we get we see that every paragraph turns blue except for this first paragraph right here so why did that first paragraph not turn blue well if we look at the rule it says only apply this rule to paragraphs that immediately follow other paragraphs with the class Bucky and since nothing was before this first paragraph that's why it started at the second one because this one follows a paragraph with a class Bucky this one does too this one goes through and this one does too this one however follows a div tag so that's why that isn't affected and another thing is whenever we have a rule using this plus selector they must have the same parent so we can't have you know a paragraph right here in another paragraph right here and expect it to be affected they must share the same parent which is the div tag in this case mommy so let me just go ahead and save that and the last rule I want to talk to you guys about is this little thing right here now I don't even know what it's called I think it's called a tilde or something but basically it's very similar to the plus sign except I make sure you don't have any extra spaces there it's very similar to the plus sign however it doesn't need to immediately follow it like it did with the plus sign for example if we go ahead and we refresh this right here we see that the same effect is happening however if we go ahead and add a span somewhere in the middle here let me just go ahead and add a random span with Hello hamster kind of spelled that wrong but it doesn't matter for this tutorial say we added a span right there now if we look this fourth paragraph right here it isn't immediately following this third one there's a span in between however if we go ahead and save this we see that the fourth paragraph is still colored blue why is that well even though there's a span in between this little tilde here said okay as long as it follows a paragraph with Bucky it doesn't need to be immediately following it there can be some stuff in between however if we change this to the plus sign that's where we can see the difference take a look at this here when i refresh it now this fourth paragraph right here turns black and it doesn't get styled because it's no longer immediately following this paragraph right here it's now immediately following the span so that's the difference between the plus selector and the tilde selector the toad a selector is the exact same but it doesn't need to immediately follow what was before it so that is the three selectors that I wanted to go over and yeah I guess that's all there is to say what's it what's the force come saying and that's all I got to say about that yeah so any that's probably the worst Forrest Gump impression I've ever did in my entire life but anyways thank you guys for watching uh yeah I'll see you guys later
