hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial we are going to discuss difference between embed tag object tag and iframe tags so let's get started I go to start click on load pad and here I write typical HTML structure opening HTML tag closing HTML tag we know that hTML is divided into two sections head section and body section and in the head section we know that we can put the title title difference between object comma embed and iframe tags closing title I save this file save as I save the file at the stop in the name default dot HTML both sides I put double quotation and I click on the Save button and minimize the notepad I read click on default dot HTML page open with the Firefox you can see that title is set to difference between object embed etc here now we proceed further and understand each of the tags I suggest you people to observe carefully each of the three tags if you observe carefully embed tag object tag find iframe tags they seem to be very similar or identical to each other with respect to their syntax or code let's see the code I start with object tag so here I am going to write object opening tag closing object and object tag we are going to put something like this object tag has one of the attribute called as data to this we have to give URL of a file or a resource so that we can be able to embed that resource in our web page you can see here I have an image picture I am going to copy the name of that picture because I want to embed the picture so here I have given picture dot jpg and I set the width W ID th width I am going to set 159 pixels heig SD height I am going to set 194 pixels now I am going to save file save go to browser and refresh once i refresh the page you will see image embedded here you can see that I got the image I minimize it and now you can see that how the object code looks and just below that I am going to write the embed tag embe d opening embed embed tag has SRC attribute to that I am going to give the same image name I am going to copy that and paste here width and height also I am going to set same I'm going to copy here and paste it and then I close a mbed embed that if you observe both of the course carefully here we are using data attribute with respect to embed we are using SRC attribute file save go to browser and refresh you can see that embed tag is also doing the same thing it is helping us to embed the file I go back here this time I am going to use iframe tag to embed the image I am going to say here iframe iframe has a attribute SRC and I am going to take the same attribute whatever we have here I copy and paste here only one attribute I am going to add here is frame piwo rder frame border I set to zero I do not want to see the frame border around the iframe that is the reason I am sitting here frame border 0 then I am going to close the iframe tag if I say file save and go to browser and refresh you can see that iframe is also giving us the same embedding option I am going to set the scrolling also crawling is equal to no I do not want scrolling up save it and refresh we don't have scrolling and you can see that we have three images embedded to the website or a web page and they are all quite similar right objet dag is also doing the same thing embed tag is also doing the same thing iframe is also doing the same I am going to show now with respect to PDF file how they work okay let me put the break tag over here I use a break tag and below that I am going to use again object and data attribute to that I am going to give the PDF file this time I want to embed the PDF file so I am going to copy intro to science PDF and I paste it here this time I am going to save with Wi D th width I am going to set $5.99 height hei ght height I am going to set 315 let's take and then I am going to or I can use width 100% and hei GST height I am going to set maybe 200 pixels is proper let me see 200 pixels then I am going to close the object tab and this should embed a PDF file in our web page file save good browser and refresh you can see that it has embedded a PDF file which we can read it is giving all the options with respect to the Firefox this time instead of object tag I am going to use embed tag e mbed embed and I am going to change here s RC and here I am going to change it to e mbed embed tag file save go to browser and refresh you can see that now we have two pdfs the same PDF is displayed here you can see two times and this time I am going to use iframe tag to do the same operation so iframe I am going to replace this embed with iframe and this one I am going to replace with iframe I save file save go to browser and refresh you can see that iframe is also doing the same operation so you can use object tag embed tag and iframe tag to embed a PDF in your website for a web page let me copy this break and paste it here and how do we how do you embed a YouTube video or a video playlist in your website or web page it's quite simple if you go to youtube and play any video or a video playlist just below the video you get a share button if you click on that again you get a share embed and email tabs click on the embed tab there you get HTML code to embed the video or video playlist all you need to do is copy the code and paste it in your web page and that HTML code I have already copied for my HTML video playlist I do open with the notepad this is how the code looks you can see that YouTube uses iframe tag it provides as iframe tag to embed any video or a video playlist to our HTML web page I am going to copy this from here I copy this and paste it in my webpage here and it is having same thing you can see iframe tag using the SRC attribute there we are giving the link to the YouTube playlist which is having the embed here you can see and width I have 560 and height is 315 and it is telling frame border should be 0 I am going to remove this this code you get in from the YouTube itself so you just need to copy that and paste it in your web page file save go to browser and refresh if we are connected to the Internet we get the video as I am not connected to the Internet selling server not found if we are connected to the internet here you will see the HTML video playlist displayed and your user can play on quite simple the same operation you can perform by using the object tag also I am going to copy that and paste here only difference is I just need to give this link I am going to copy this and paste here that link and width and height I am going to set same 560 I am copy I'm gonna copy and paste here and a height is going to be 315 copy and paste here file save and go to browser and refresh so you can see that it is not showing anything L present I am going to copy the embed tag also and paste it over here and to this I am going to give the same path I copy that and paste here to the SRC attribute and width I am going to set 560 in height I am going to set 350 paste here file save go to browser and refresh so here you can see that we are not getting here anything with respect to embed tag because it is not identifying anything neither the object tag also I am going to cut that and paste here ever I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that nothing we are finding with respect to the embed and object tab but with respect to the syntax they are similar and if you are connected to the Internet actually all of them three of them are going to display the HTML video tutorial series playlist embedded here as I am not connected to inter connected to the Internet I am not getting any proper result but if you observe carefully all are performing the same operation but embed tag object tag and iframe tags are behaving quite little bit different in the browser with respect to the syntax if you observe object tag takes data attribute embed tags take SRC attribute and iframe tags takes SRC attribute to embed the external resource then what is the difference between them and when we have to use them actual okay you need to remember some point embed tag object tag and iframe tags are used to embed resources which are external or internal to website the difference is embed and object tag are static whereas iframe is dynamic for but iframe has a capability to adjust itself with respect to updated plugins and we were software configuration whereas embed and object tags not if you have observed here embed and object tags were not giving any frame or guideline to the user that is it is not connected connected to the Internet or server not found whereas iframe this is actually iframe tag doing this operation we faced some problems with respect to object and embed tag whereas we don't face problem with the iframe tag it at least gives us a proper information and identifies the software configurations available on devices and also we know that mobile devices do not support flash players if we embed a video using the object or a embed tag then the video can't be played because they don't know which video player or a plug-in or a software available on the viewers device as they are static whereas iframe gets update in real time it detects and automatically uses the appropriate video player and place the video on almost all platform similarly for other file format plugins also for example for PDF files images etc the iframe tag works quite proper in all devices hence it is recommended to use iframe tag instead of object or embed tags also object tag is deprecated use embed tag only when iframe tag is not suitable to embed an external resource iframe tag handles software settings updates dynamically hence YouTube video link are embedded using iframe tags you can use object tag if you want to run the java applet and I suggest you people to use embed tag over the object tag because object tag is getting deprecated and I suggest you people to use embed tag only when you cannot perform something using the iframe tag as I told that object and embed tag are static whereas iframe tag is a dynamic and it is supported by almost all the browsers and html5 prefers using the iframe tag or object tag an embed tag so for this tutorial this much is you know friends I suggest you people to try these tags and try this code yourself and experiment more for more benefits please subscribe and don't
