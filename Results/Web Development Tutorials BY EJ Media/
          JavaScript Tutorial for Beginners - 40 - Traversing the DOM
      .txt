in this video we're going to talk about traversing the DOM and we first hear that term you might be like what on earth does that mean but it's actually quite simple and I'll explain it in this video now up to now we've been targeting elements using the get element by ID get elements by tag and get elements by class methods and so really all you're doing when you're traversing the Dom it's just a different way to target an element that's all it is it's just a different way and what we're using is the parent-child relationship to target an element and so for instance you know before we would have used a get element by ID maybe to target this individual paragraph but now what we're going to do is use the parent-child relationship itself within the document object model to target one of these paragraph elements and so what does that mean well we're first going to target the div and once we have the div which is the parent then we can use that parent-child relationship to target the child and we'll actually use a property this time to target one of the elements and so that's the movement we're moving from parent to child from parent to child we're moving downwards now you can actually flip this and we'll do this in the next video you can actually go from child to parent so you can go upwards and you can even go sideways you can go from sibling to sibling to sibling so that's what traversing the Dom means that's all it means we're just using the parent-child relationship within the Dom hierarchy to move around to target an element we're moving from the parent and then once we get the parent we can actually target the child and so actually we are going to use get element by ID to target the div first and then once we have the parent we can again move downwards and target one of the children so that's what traversing the Dom means again okay so let's flip over to the code and you'll see here I've edited the code from the last video a little bit I've just changed the function to change text and change a little bit of the verbage here and we've got for paragraph elements inside of our div so first we're going to target the div and then we're going to target one of these paragraph elements so let's go over here and we'll start filling in the code in our JavaScript function so the first thing as I said we want to get ahold of our parent that's what we're going to do so we're going to use the get element by ID again of course we're grabbing the idea of main so now we've got the parent but again we're not actually going to manipulate this element now we just want to get ahold of it so now we can target the children so now I'll copy and paste the next line into here so now we create a variable to hold the child and we can just use our parent object now and go ahead and select a child that we want and again notice we're not using the get element by ID down here we're using a property and the name of this property is child nodes now this builds a node list of all the nodes under our parent and so again we can target whatever child we want now let's pull up the webpage here really quickly I want to just show you something very important and let's go ahead and just minimize this and we'll flip back to the JavaScript code whoops bring that back up here now what I want to point out is we've got four paragraph elements here and we put the position of the node in here so you might think well this first paragraph would start with zero and you would be correct except remember a few videos ago I said that there are many different nodes in the document object model now we only really need to be concerned with the big three I like to call them the attribute node the text node and the element node but there are other nodes and you just need to be aware that this says child nodes that means every single node in there there is actually a node for white space so this white space here is treated as a node in the document object model there's also a white space node right here there's a white space node right here so the zero position would actually start out with the white space node this would be in the one position and then this white space node right here would be two and this second paragraph would be in the third position so that's the one we're going to target so just be aware of that this says child nodes it doesn't say element nodes so this will encompass all the nodes so let's put a three in here okay so that's good and then we're just going to go ahead and do a little bit of styling here that's the point of this lecture we're just talking about how to use these child properties but we'll go ahead and use our child object and we'll just change the color to blue so let's save everything up here and then let's run our web page and now everything should work in this second paragraph should flip to blue and it did okay good so let's close this out now let's go ahead and I'm going to put a comment in down here to save this line of code because we're actually going to talk about another property now so let's put that needed different slashes there there we go so we'll save this and as usual I'll put this code into the information section of this video so now there's another property that we can use and I'll just copy and paste it right over here because we're going to reuse our parent object again and its first element child now notice this says element so that means we don't have to worry about those nasty little whitespace nodes this will just give us the first paragraph element this is kind of useful because let's say that's all we want to target we just want to get that first child element so we don't have to worry about position or anything it will just go right to that first paragraph and change the text so let's go ahead and save this and we'll go over here and run everything and there you see it changed the first element good now you might have surmised that we can also flip this to last so let's go ahead and do that and we'll run this and there you can see it changed the last element it found so that's a good start so in the next video we're actually going to switch the order like I said we're going to start with a child and target that with a get element by ID and then we're going to move upwards and we'll actually have the parent here so again we'll switch the order in the next video see you guys that
