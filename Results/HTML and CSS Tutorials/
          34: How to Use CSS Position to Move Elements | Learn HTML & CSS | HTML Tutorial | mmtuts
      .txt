how's it going everyone welcome back to next episode and how to create HTML and CSS now in this episode one who requested me to talk about something called precision which is a styling we can apply to the elements inside the website and I want to mention that we use precision in order to move around objects inside a website hence the name position and elements so what I want to do is first of all I want to show you that I have a basic index page that has two sections inside the body tag I have section 1 and then I have section 2 that has a basic development inside of it that I'm going to move around inside the website so I can show you the effect of using position now position can be used in all sorts of elements not just developments we can use it on text images basically everything we have inside the HTML 5 we can move around using position so just to show you what I have here if we were to go inside the browser you can see that I have section 1 which has a 100% width inside the browser and I have section 2 down here which has 50% with inside the browser and then the dip box is going to be the blue box we have over here on the left side so what I want to do is I want to move around this blue box using position and I should mention which is very important that you should not use position inside the website unless you have a specific purpose in mind for using position if you want to move an object to the left or the right or up and down you should be using padding or margin okay if you have a specific purpose in mind then you need to use position because if I were to take an example where I have two images on top of each other if I were to push the top image down on top of the other image by saying position and then move it down then the image is going to not push down the bottom image with it it's going to go on top of the bottom image so it's very important that you keep this in mind because it can be a bit screwy when it comes to the design of the website because other elements are not going to be affected by using position on some elements so the solution here if you were to intended ly want to use precision on an element to make it go on top of other you would also need to look into something called said index now said index and again I'm getting a little bit off-topic here if you have two objects inside the website let's say the top section and the below section here if I want to move down the top section on top of the below section here then whichever element is going to be on top is going to be the element that has the highest set index inside the style sheet so if we were to go inside my style sheet and again just to serve before we get into position and go down to section one I can give it a set index and set it to something like a thousand just to give it something which means that if section two has a set index of 500 then it's going to go below section one because it has a lower set index so just want to push that out there that that's something you need to consider if you want to move around elements on purpose and move them on top of other elements so now let's go and get back to talking about position when it comes to using position we have a couple of different ones we can choose from we have something called precision relative absolute fixed and something called sticky which is a new thing that we we have inside CSS and there's a couple of things we need to talk about when it comes to using sticky because it's actually a really cool feature that we used to we needed to use something called JavaScript which is another programming language in order to get this sticky effect working using the elements inside the website so I think it's really cool they added this feature into CSS in order to get this working we're gonna get that get to that at the end of this video here so just hold on for a second now if I want to move around the blue box which right now has a class set to move me then I can use something called position and set it to relative now position relative is going to move the box compared to its relative location which is where it is right now so you want to move it down and need to move it away from a certain direction so if we wanted to move it down I need to move from the top but if that makes sense so if we want to move it downwards I need to define top because I want to move away from the top about 100 pixels then if we were to go back inside the website refresh you can see that the elements get pushed 100 pixels down to the bottom of the page now again we can do it is to left right and bottom as well if you want to now this is all fun and good but let's go and do something slightly more fun let's go ahead and move this element like take it out from the entire website and put it on a different layer and then just display it somewhere inside the window of the website so if you want to go ahead and propor it at the top of the website even though it's an element inside wonder sections down here if I want to just take it out and put at the top right corner of the website then if I go inside the styling I'm gonna say position:absolute say top it's going to be zero pixels and right is going to be zero pixels as well then when i refresh the browser you can see that would take it out from the entire website and place it on a top layer somewhere inside the browser now if we were to say top a hundred pixels then it's not going to again like in the previous example it's not going to move it relative to it where it is right now which was over here in this left side is going to move it a her pixel from the top of the website inside the browser here now what if you want to do this but inside the container instead of the entire browser which is sort of a weird thing if we couldn't do it inside the container here now if I wanted to be affected by the containers inside of then I need to go to the container styling and add position to that as well so want to say position relative and I'm using relative because if you were to just add relative without adding top left right or bottom is not going to do anything it's just gonna give it the styling position relative without actually affecting the element itself so if we were to do this save it then you can see that it's going to go to the right side and a hundred pixels from the top from the contain the containers inside of my worst is cracked out there so this is how we can use position:absolute now we also have something called position fixed which if we were to go back up to move me if I changed it to fixed and save it you can see that we get the exact same result except for it again it's going to go to the top-right corner instead of being affected by position relative which we added to the parent element so this is not going to make it different when it comes to fixed inside this specific example here now the cool thing about using fixed and the reason that so many people use it inside a website is because let's pretend for a second that we have a menu at the top of the website but once you scroll down the menu is going to disappear into nothingness at the top of the website if I want the minute to follow me down the website I need to add position fixed to it because right now if we were to scroll you can see that the element up here is going to stick with me as I'm scrolling up and down the website so if we were to go ahead and make just a mini example here and change the width of this box the blue box we have here to 100% and instead say top is going to be zero pixels then also add a left I set it to zero save it go inside the browser you can see that now we have something that looks sort of like a navigation or like a menu inside a website so we're going to scroll up and down you can see it follows me now I should mention that you don't need to add precision to all the elements inside the navigation or inside the elements that you're using position fixed on or any other sort of precision on because all the elements inside of it are just going to follow the element that you use position on because it's the parent element to all the elements inside of it so it's just gonna do the same thing now one thing I want to mention about this navigation example is the fact that right now if I were to have content inside the website inside the body called the top section here and I wanted to not go below the navigation because right now if I were to have text inside this box I can actually go and show an example of it if it were to go first of all to the index page and take the dip move it out from the section because we don't need to have it in there like so and if we were to include text inside section one and say here is text then if we were to refresh the browser we can't see the text inside the website because it's going to be underneath this specific element inside the website so what I need to do is I need to go ahead and push down section one if we were to go down to the styling here the same height as my navigation so I would say padding top and set it to honor pixels because that's the height of my navigation save it refresh the browser and now I can see the text inside the browser here so that's how I would actually display content inside the website even though you have a sticking menu at the top of the website again I got a bit off-topic here but I just want to show you since this is the most typical example use position:fixed you know inside of so the next example here I'm just gonna go and move the padding top and remove the text from inside the section actually I'm just gonna go ahead and go back to the previous like so the next example here if I were to just refresh and again delete the position fix tiling there we go it's going to be something called position sticky now sticky like I said is going to be an effect that we used to need to use JavaScript for node to get working which is the fact that when you have something inside the website like a menu or something once you start scrolling if I want the navigation hits to stick at the top once I hit it with the top of the browser and keep following me down then we can use something called position sticky now if I were to go in and added by saying position sticky not static sticky there we go and set it to top zero pixels then you can see that once I start scrolling and it hits the bottom here it's going to follow me down the page now we can also go ahead and set this to a hundred pixels just to give an example save it and then you can see it sticks at a hundred pixels away from the top of the website now one thing about using this specific sticky method is that right now it's such a new feature inside CSS that not all browsers has full support for it just quite yet we do have Safari as at these as I'm making this video Safari doesn't have the specific styling supported inside Safari and it's only the position sticky is not supporting the relative and absolute it does still well still it does support that but it doesn't support sticky so in order to get a to support sticky we need to use something called the prefix which we use inside CSS in order to force certain browsers to apply this styling to them so what we can do until Safari gets full support for this darling is we can go ahead and add the prefix to the styling here so I'm going to copy position sticky and then I'm gonna add the prefix in front of the value of this certain styling so in front of sticky I'm going to add a prefix for something called WebKit which means that we're targeting certain browsers with WebKit if we can also target Firefox using something called marks mo sets I think you said in English we can also target opera or PR I'm not quite sure how to say the name of that browser by writing Oh instead of WebKit so like that and then marks for FileZilla and but today usually we just use WebKit for most stylings we'll use prefixes so if I were to use WebKit and do this by having both the WebKit and the RIC allistic is styling we can also get a working inside Safari just FYI so this is not going to make a difference it's still going to do the exact same thing inside the browser as before so this is how we can move around objects using precision using CSS and like I said you should only use position if you have a specific purpose in mind you shouldn't use it instead using margins and padding's inside a website it's very important you don't do this because it's going to mess up your design inside the website if you use position for everything that they want to move around inside the website so just so you're aware of it okay so I hope you all enjoyed I'll see you next time [Music]
