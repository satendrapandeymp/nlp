hi guys welcome to narration technologies this is a Braj in this video session we'll observe deprecated elements some of you guys are eagerly waiting for this video and in this video session mainly I am concentrating on deprecated elements what is the meaning of deprecated and why w3c duplicated who is w3c and what is the w3c roles and responsibilities in the Reb environment in html5 environment area what are the organizations actually involved like this various various topics we can see in this video session first a deprecated means deleted deprecated means a removed or duplicated means not advisable not recommended who not you and me it is not recommended by w3c it is one topmost organization to improve the standards of the web that is what we are calling World Wide Web Consortium it is web standards organization it was founded in 1994 by Tim berners-lee and actually he is the father of HTML at the same time is a father of w3c and w3c any kind of technology related you are you are related to dotnet Java PHP RC c plus plus whatever the technologies we are related to we need that exactly what kind of information means w3c so visit official website w3c dot o-r-g once you are going to that website they are providing all the details related to real-time environment so you are a developer designer programmer any kind of person you are related to any technology first you must know what are the w3c standards now I am going inside this w3c duplicated a few tags what are the tags actually duplicated now I want to show you these tags the following list of tags has been dropped or replaced in html5 environment these are the tags not available acronym applet base one big center dar font frame I'm set no frames is index strike strike dell teletype underline XMP pre mark you blink BG sound param no break like this number of tags are duplicated from advanced reverb environment area so what are the exactly the meaning of these tags duplicated why they duplicated what is the reason behind that and these are the tags right now also browser support is there like that number of questions commonly you guys are questioning in the classrooms also in offline as well as in online but my answer only one these are the tags not supported by all electronic devices mainly gadgets or widgets what is the meaning of gadget what is the meaning of widget is nothing but small electronic devices where small electronic devices are not a compatible those tags are not recommended because right now the smart era is going on smart is nothing but compatible for the web and Internet nowadays smartphones available or tablets available different different sizes of widgets available so these attacks are not comfort and compatible that is a reason w3c is not recommending so hereafter whenever you are developing new websites or latest websites please concentrate on the whatever the list of the tags I provided please do not implement these tags in your web environment area so reason I can say for example you people are ready to ask some questions what that one means okay so these many tax deprecated but what are the alternate tax for that one that is also some of you guys are questioning me frequent in the classrooms yes yes there is answer also s acronym is not there yes immediately they added a BB our abbreviation tag applet e is not there they added object attack base font is not there they added font attack and a big is not there they added font size property center is not there they added text align property dir is not they added order list unordered list like this different properties and center tag is not there texture and I said already font tag font tag is not there number of properties in CSS there is a big list of CSS properties available frame frame set I know frames already explained in video session 7 please observe frame and frame set and no frames after that one is index is a very powerful one easy index tag is there but that is right now we are not using these index replaced by input type or input so text box we are calling this is a multi-line text box yes means strike means for example than one application notification completed our application time closed application is not valid that time we are putting one line and we are striking through that and tt-tell e type Ilya type is nothing but it is a kind of format like dot matrix printers previously there are the dot matrix printers available when when you are printing other dot matrix printers there is a kind of dots who are coming this is nothing but teletype and you use nothing but underline why you tag is deprecated again another question commonly people are asking you is you tag is good no yes very good but there is a property available text-decoration:underline text or decoration over line text or decoration line through if these many properties are available why should i implement this tag you giving only one you but my text decoration giving more than one right next one is XMP XMP is nothing but pre we are calling simple li pre-formatted text is nothing but simple e effectively how to arrange the text next one mark you is a beautiful tag video session a to completely concentrate only on mark to tag please refer video session 8 for mark you BB is nothing but bold for video session 6 I mentioned about bold italic blink all the tags so these are the deprecated then you can expect another answer another question also from your side what that one means why duplicated tag you explained again in the previous video sessions see here deprecated information different wheel and are not important important most that one because deprecated tax now we are not implementing but learning time what tag what purpose we are using what is the reason behind that learning is our prime model right next one blink is frequently blinking the test continuously now blink is not there because in our Java there is a pro but available document dot get element by ID dot blink right next one is BG sound is out ultimate property so BG sound actually previously available nowadays because of html5 multimedia components video audio and track tag BG sound is out now nobody using param how to pass parameters for the attack for example I want to pass a couple of parameters we can pass easily video tag time audio tag name we can pass easily no break no break is another powerful tag it is never break but why the remote white-space:nowrap available there is a property so every deprecated tag replaced with a new property a new attribute so these are the list of the deprecated tags available and I want to show you the w3c dot o-r-g website practically w3 dot o-r-g simply also you can mention that once you are going to w3 dot o-r-g and you can say
