hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 8 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to add images to your website so if you take a look at my htdocs folder over here I've got my index file and then I've gone ahead and added two images into this directory so we've got a picture of me in winter and then a picture of me in winter but this one's labeled small and I'll explain why later in the tutorial so let me go ahead and open up this image and you can see that this is just a picture of me but this is the picture that I want to add to my website so I'm gonna close that and let's open that or yeah let's code that into my website so to do that we're gonna add an image tag into our document over here so I'm going to open up an image tag by typing i mg and that stands for image and if I enter and just autocomplete that you'll see that we automatically get this attribute called sr c which stands for image source and this is how we tell the browser what image we want to add to our website so we need to put in that image name within the source so let me just open up finder again and because my images are in the same folder as my index file all I need to do is take this image name and copy that and paste it into my source make sure that you have your file extension over here I think some guys if I just say get info in Mac or if you go to properties in Windows you can check what the file extension is so in this case I can see it is a kind of see we need dot jpg in the file extension over there alright just make sure you get your file extension right and make sure that it's there because sometimes you could maybe click hide extension and then it doesn't show up in the what do you call this finder or Windows Explorer right so let me go ahead and save this now and come back over to the browser and hit refresh and now you can see my image has been added but it is absolutely massive so I've got to kind of scroll around now so that is quite an intense zoom up of me you can see nostril hair yeah but yeah that is the picture of me added right now it's a little bit big so let's take a look at how I can resize this and I also want to talk about some other attributes of ear so to resize the image in HTML we can add an extra attribute called width there is also one for height so you can choose either one although it is recommended to have both and I'm just going to set width equal to a thousand two hundred pixels I'm gonna leave height blank for now just to show you guys with what will happen let me hit save come back here and hit refresh and well now you can see that I've got my image displaying much much smaller but it's scaled right it's scaled uniformly we didn't we didn't stretch our scale scale the image in any way we scaled it we didn't stretch it or warp it right now if I put in a value for the height and it happens to be the wrong value like I know the right value is going to be 800 pixels but if I put in a wrong value like 400 what that'll do is then squash the image to fit the wrong dimensions so let's come back here and hit refresh and as you can see now I'm looking a little bit squashed I don't like that obviously we wouldn't do that to any of our images so make sure that you always have the correct values and in this case I know that this image this image of me is actually five thousand four hundred and seventy two pixels in width and three thousand six hundred and forty eight pixels in height and if you scale this uniformly I just happened to do my homework it'll be one thousand two hundred by eight hundred so let's hit refresh and well yeah now the image is displaying and it's not warped it's not stretched or anything like that that's good but the problem is that this image is still this five thousand four hundred and seventy two pixels in width right and if I right-click on this and say get info you'll see at the top corner over here it says that the image is four point seven megabytes in size now that is absolutely massive if you are creating a website with images that are this size it's gonna make the website load extremely extremely slowly and it's also gonna use up your bandwidth on your server so if you are limited to a certain amount of bandwidth depending on where you're hosting having a really big image like this is really a chase away your visitors and waste your money so instead of using really big unedited images you should always use a program like Photoshop so I use Photoshop just to resize your image and make it the correct size and also optimize it for web and that's what I've already done with this image went to me small so if I come back over to the browser and I change the name here to winter me small dot jpg and I can get rid of these height and width attributes just to show you right now okay it's not actually gonna change anything because that was the exact size of my image these 1,200 by 800 pixels but yeah now it is loading a much much smaller image if I just get info here and I take a look at it it is a hundred and eighty five kilobytes in size so this well that is a mosquito biting me in the arm so this image is a hundred and eighty five kilobytes in size and that is obviously much much smaller our website is going to load a lot faster we're saving data so you know we're not gonna run out of traffic space or data space on our server anytime soon and yeah it's just better to make sure you optimize your images for that reason and now that I've spoken about that let's get the last attribute out the way because if you run this in a HTML validator which I talked about a few tutorials ago it's gonna give you an error and that is because all images need an extra attribute which is the alt attribute and you're going to set this equal to a value so what the alt attribute is is basically text that this basically explains this image so if for some reason I made a spelling mistake and my image doesn't show up let's just yeah take away those two else come back here hit refresh you can see my image is not showing up anymore because I made a mistake in the name at least if I've got some text here in the alt attribute the text will show up it also allows certain things like Google's search engines to figure out what was actually in this image so let's just make the alt attribute Quinton what in winter not water wind and that at least explains what was in this image so right now let's hit refresh and you can see my alt attribute shows up over here I still have spelling mistakes in my image name but if I fix the image name to not have spelling mistakes anymore and come back here and hit refresh the image shows up but if certain search engines like Google Google's search engine can still tell what is in this image by looking at the alt attribute so yeah that is all I have for you actually there's one more thing right so I was talking about width and height and I was talking about how these are recommended the other thing is I'm probably gonna have to get rid of the alt attribute to show you this but if I make a spelling mistake in the image name the one thing about this is the browser still knows how much space to it's set aside for the image so let me go ahead and save this and come back here and refresh and you can see that we've got the this border displaying right now and that's just because the browser knows to set aside 1200 pixels by 800 pixels for the image that I've chosen and the reason why it knows this is because we put these two attributes yeah so even though the images in showing up the layout of our website shouldn't get messed up because the browser is saving this space and so that's why those two attributes are recommended but you actually should have all four to be on the safe side so let me go ahead and save this now and now I'll end the video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means not to me now why you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me out on patreon you can also check
