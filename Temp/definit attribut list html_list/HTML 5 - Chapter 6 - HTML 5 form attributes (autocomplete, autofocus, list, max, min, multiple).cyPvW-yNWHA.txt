hello welcome to html5 tutorials chapter 7 html5 format rebukes part 1 brought to you by agro technologies my name is Harish in this session we are going to learn about the new form a tributes in html5 so here comes a list of html5 form attributes they are order complete how to focus list max and minimum multiple required pattern placeholder and step as of now in this session we are going to concentrate only on this first set they are autocomplete focus or the focus list maximum minimum and multiple so without wasting much time let me jump into autocomplete attribute the autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete on or off okay and when autocomplete is on the browser automatically complete the input values based on the values that the user has entered before and autocomplete attribute works with the form and the following input types text search URL telephone email password date because range and color so now without wasting much time let me show you a demo of this autocomplete attribute and here is a simple example what I'm going to coat there in Visual Studio code okay you can observe your first name last name and email today form tag or specified autocomplete on in the sense anything inside this form tag okay we'll be having this autocomplete attribute with the value on but explicitly to this input type email I've specified autocomplete 'off so now what I will do is let me jump in visual studio code let me add a form tag so let me remove this as of now but let me specify auto complete on let me take first name input type as text and let me assign a name to it telling like first name we take we just copy and paste it last name and this is Gemma stands for email input type is email okay let me give a name email and what I will do is I'll specify autocomplete 'off to this okay let me add input' type submit' let me assign the value to it as so it is the types of it let me push this page to the browser and here is my source file now it navigates the browser there it renders a form okay now I learnt those Sam ok now I can observe your as soon as I enter so let me enter something like Brendan ok last name let me do it it's ech and this is something like I add Gmail sorry for this like gmail.com now let me click Submit now it's gone now I'll type Brendan you can observe here okay I'm so very clearly when I type Brendan it is showing me the autocomplete now when I click on this it itself completed the entire text in the sense it's got selected and it is placing inside the text box I mean leave a nice type II can observe here this is called autocomplete okay it show me the intelligence like what I have time before then I can select that read empirically enters inside the text but to the email you can observe your in mind code have specified that autocomplete 'off so in the last time I've entered like a cat gmail.com you can observe we are right now I'm not getting any help text which I can select it and I can place it inside the text box this is what the autocomplete feature is okay and coming to second one auto for auto focus the auto focus attribute specifies that the input field should automatically get focus when the page loads so what do you mean by this let me explain you let me remove this so your I'm going to tell like auto focus so before this let me control X we remove this as a flow so let me go back and let me refresh so now when i refresh my page you can observe right now any text box are not focused when they click on them they get focused but my objective is as soon as i refresh the page means when the page loads this forms has to get focused this fields has to get focus and since it has to get this blue border as necessary fresh the page so when the page loads automatically it has to be get focused so how to do that it's very simple I need to specify attribute called autofocus controllers now you can observe now it's not autofocus now when i refresh you can observe the first input type box is getting focused this is called autofocus attribute okay as I said refresh the page as soon as the page loads the first name input type text box is focused similarly if I need to do to the entire form elements what I need to do is I need to specify this pure let me check out is this going to work let me refresh okay it's not going to work so what do you mean by this we had applied to this individual elements okay individual input types okay can observe the first element is getting focused when i refresh the page this is what about autofocus is and coming to the list the list attribute refers to a data list element that contains predefined options for an input element so what we are going to do is we are going to take an input control input element and we'll make that input element act as a selector list drop-down list so how do I do that it's very simple let me go back let me remove everything here so let me take let me let me like select skills input let me remove this I'm just going to specify a list let me specify like skills data so now I'm going to generate okay detail list I guess yep the data list with that ID so datalist so I'm going to assign our ID to this so the ID will be the list name list value what I've given you so when I click on the date put control it populates this list so I need to specify option the value will be HTML so let me remove this this tie is not necessary so this is html5 push this to the cobbler and this will be typical JavaScript this will be the typical jQuery we do control s mean go back let me refresh and here you can observe when I mouse over on the input control you can also be getting a drop down this point ladder downwards when I click on that you can observe very clearly this input element is acting like a select tag in the sense what select element gives us it gives us a drop-down of things and I can select that I can select the particular thing so right now you can observe I've selected html5 again when i refresh it's going to select the jQuery this is what about the list is like a least attribute refers to a data list element that contains predefined options for an input element this is out the list attribute going to work and coming to minimum and maximum the men are maximum attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for an input element so the this minimum and maximum attributes work with the following input types they are number range date date time local month time and week so here I have a simple example what I've done is I have taken input type number and I'm telling like minimum value the number it can take us 1 and the maximum is 5 so about that it's not going to take any number so let me show this simple example so let me go here let me remove this so let me tell like input its number so I'm going to go into the like minimum it has to take us 1 and max it can take us five so I'm going to like select number between one and so when I do controllers let me go back let me refresh so you can observe your I can type six okay but when I use this control one two three four five about that when I click on that it's not taking and below this it does not go the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 5 this is how the min and maximum attribute works we can limit the things like setting the minimum and maximum values to a particular control so since I've taken the other input type number so I can enter the number between 1 and 5 by toggling the buttons upward and downward button okay you are this it's fine maximum and minimum is 1 okay and coming back here so we have multiple attribute the multiple attribute specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in the input element the multiple attribute works with the following input types email and file so let me show you this it's very simple so what I will do is let me remove this we specify input it is file so let me go with that input email a file okay it's a fillable take a file select three images so all ready to do is right now if I don't specify multiple I can select only one image as of now but if I specify multiple I can select multiple files so let me go back let me refresh so once again so I'll click on this choose files it's going to open with my so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select three images one sorry guys one two and three so you can observe it three files and got selected so if I remove this multiple what's gonna happen you controllers let me go back click refresh click on file chooser so and click one and this too so you can observe you're holding the control key but still I can't select multiple things because it can select only one file at a time but if I specify multiple ok I can select multiple things multiple images at a single short so 1 2 3 4 rotary files is for this is so when I over on this again it will show you like the name of the file for your selected Auto Bild capture and data list so this is what the speciality of these attributes I hope you understood this attributes very clearly that is order complete order focus list max min multiple so a great day
