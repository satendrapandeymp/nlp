in this video we're going to take a first look at horizontal menus and whenever you're creating a horizontal menu or a vertical menu for that matter it's always about a four or five step process and that's what we're going to cover in this video now the first thing we want to do is establish a section that's going to hold our menu items so we need to first make a section and what do we use for sections we use the div element tag and so I've created an ID we're going to use an ID for this and I've called it nav which obviously stands for navigation bar and so I've already typed out the code so I'll go ahead and copy and paste it in here so our background color for this section will be dark green we're going to set the height of this section to 35 pixels we want the font size to be 25 pixels we're going to have a font weight of bold we want our menu items to have bold text and the font we're going to use is Tahoma so let's go ahead and save this and we'll refresh over here and there you can see now we've got our nice green section now keep in mind that these some of these items like the font will be inherited right we're setting up inheritance here and you'll remember that it starts out with a div that's the parent element and then we'll have a UL element and inside there is a list element and inside there is a anchor element and actually that's the five step process we started out styling our nav section and the next we'll do the UL element but before we do that let's go ahead and put in our HTML for our menu items and these are going to look very similar to the vertical menu list items that we used same process so again UL element the li element and the anchor element so as I said we'll start out styling the UL element first so let me copy and paste this now you will recognize this when we did those vertical menus you always want to eliminate any padding or margin that the browser will automatically insert into our menu items so we're just going to set this to zero because again we want to control the padding in the margin we don't want to let the browser do that we're also going to get rid of the bullet points and we do that with the list - style - type CSS property so usually these three will always go in the UL element section and then we want the text to be centered so let's see what we get here and there you can see we've got our menu items now the bullet points aren't there and no extra margin or padding are being placed into here by the browser but now we need to have our menu items side by side by side and we do that by styling against the list element so let's go ahead and paste some code into here for that and we'll just move right down here now of course for these menu items to be side by side by side we need to convert our list element to inline we want that to be in line because remember by default they are block elements so they don't they will be displayed in a top-down order to get elements to display side by side you need to convert them to inline so let's go ahead and refresh our page and there you can see now our list items are side by side by side and we've got 15 pixels of space between them and that's good and this vertical-align:middle basically just centers our text inside our section so that's what that property accomplishes for us and so now we need to go ahead and perform our fourth step and that is we have to style our anchor tag and remember the anchor tag is this area in which we get the hand all this area is the actual anchor tag so that's what we need to style now and obviously we don't want to keep this default purple color that the browser is using so let's go ahead and copy and paste that and let's just go ahead and refresh our page and I'll explain each one of these so there you can see we actually need to widen this a little bit so there you can see now we got rid of the underline with the text - decoration property by the way you might be asking well why didn't we put that up here and the reason is this is not actually inheritable you can't inherit this property so that's why we didn't put it up with our UL rule set we actually have to put this in our anchor tag rule set and for some reason I've got two colors here actually I think we only need the white ones so let's go ahead and get rid of this property let's refresh that I don't think that changes anything no it didn't okay so um and we actually added 8 more pixels of padding around our content for our anchor tag so that gives us a little bit more room from the edges the color of the text again will be white and we're using the vertical-align:middle property again and that will keep everything nice and centered within our section now we need to add the Hoover property we've talked about that throughout the series so everyone should know what that is by now so I'll just go ahead and copy and paste that in here now what we want to do here is just add a little effect so that when the user hovers over a particular menu item we'll get a nice little contrast to inform them that they're over that particular link so let's go ahead and hit refresh and there you can see now that when we hover over each one of these items the color actually is in Reverse so you can see the background is now white and the color of the text is now black which we specified right here and here we put the background color as white as opposed to dark green and so that gives a nice little effect to let the user know that they are hovered over that particular link now in the next video we're going to actually take a look at buttons and making some really awesome buttons because I've had a lot of requests from people that want to do really professional quality looking buttons so I'm going to put together that CSS code for the next video we will come back to horizontal menus and we'll actually do some drop-down horizontal menus in the future
