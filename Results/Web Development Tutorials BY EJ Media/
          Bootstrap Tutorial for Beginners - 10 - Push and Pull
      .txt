in this video we're gonna talk about pushing and pulling columns in bootstrap and this is sort of useful if you want to be more and more responsive with your website and this has to do with multiple devices now this will be apparent in a few minutes now to make this example more real-world I've moved our main column to the first position so this should appear on the left and our sidebar will now appear in the center so let's go ahead and launch this in chrome and let's see what we get and that's exactly what we wanted so our main column now is on the left and our sidebar is now in the center now let's go ahead and minimize this and let's see what this looks like on small devices and that's exactly what we wanted now the reason a lot of people do this is they want their main content on small devices to appear first that's usually good operating procedure to put your main column at the very beginning because as you know this is a small device and you want that content right at the top and then all the rest of the smaller content can go on the bottom but of course if your user is on the desktop it is standard operating procedure to put the main column in the center so how do we get the best of both worlds how do we get this main column appear in the center now if we move it back that will drop the main column down on small devices so that's where pushing and pulling comes to the rescue and what we can do is push this column to the right and that's what pushing means it means pushing to the right and then we can pull this column back to the left so once again pushing pushes it to the right and pulling pulls it to the left so let's go ahead and do that so we're first going to go right here and we're gonna type in call - MD - and here is where we use the keyword push because remember we want to push our main column to the right and we're gonna push it three columns and that's what this means we're gonna push this three columns to the right and we're only going to be doing this on medium sized devices and larger so the large and medium sized devices will only push this column this will not occur on small devices because remember we want our main column to appear first on small devices such as cell phones so that's what we use now if you're going to push you also have to pull the other column otherwise you're going to get some weird results so that's what we need to do we need to now pull this column to the left and all we do here is switch this to the keyword pull but we have to pull this six columns because remember this is six columns away because this large column here our MD six column is in the left position so we need to pull this back six and we need to push this three now you may get confused by this but really what we're doing is we're just swapping right we're swapping columns and if you're not sure about the size I have this little trick I use you'll notice here that this is MD six well you want to match it down here so this column needs to be pulled back six spaces and you'll notice that we determined three columns here because this is three columns in size so we only need to push this three so you notice this kind of diagonal little relationship this is six and six and this is three and three so that's kind of a good way you can actually calculate how far you have to pull or push you can just kind of use that little magic that I just did so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and load up our page and take a look at that that worked perfectly it pushed our main column to the right and we pushed our left column to the left so everything looks great on the medium-sized device now what we need to make sure is that this didn't take effect on the smaller devices so let's minimize this and take a look at that we get exactly what we needed we wanted our main column to appear first on cell phones and small devices so that's how pushing and pulling works and remember it starts right here we said hey push this only on medium-sized devices and bigger and same thing for the pull so again that's how pushing and pulling works and it's very useful if you want to have a very responsive web page and you want to reorder your columns depending on the device that is being used for your web site
