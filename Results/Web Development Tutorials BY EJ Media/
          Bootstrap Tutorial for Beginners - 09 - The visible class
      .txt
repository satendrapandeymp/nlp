in the last video we added these columns to our main column and so we learned how to nest columns in this video we're going to learn how to use some of the responsive utility classes that bootstrap provides and what that allows you to do is only to display certain elements with particular devices and sizes so it's sort of like a media queries on steroids so basically we added these three columns now look what happens when we minimize this these kind of get all crunched into the main column so what we want to do is actually remove these on smaller devices we only want to display our main column we don't want all these inside columns here because this doesn't look quite as good so what we want to only do is display these in larger resolutions so that's what we're going to do is let's go ahead and close this out and so here is where of course we put our inside columns so again bootstrap provides classes that we can use to go ahead and make these visible with particular device types so let's go to this first one which we have right here and what we do is we go right past our column class and we type in the keyword visible and so this is the visible class that we can use and then you put in - MD and remember that stands for medium-sized device so what this means is we are only going to display this column on a medium sized device it will not display on any other type of resolution and we can also put in visible for the larger devices as well which of course is LG it's the same thing you just put in - LG and now this column will not display on smaller devices it should only display on the medium-sized and larger devices so let's go ahead and copy this and let's go down and put this in our other columns as well our other inside comps we're just going to paste this right here and then we're gonna go down to this final inside column the third one that we created and we're gonna copy and paste that right there so now let's go ahead and save this let's go ahead and load our web page again and there you can see the columns are displayed which is what we want it will be displayed on medium and larger resolutions now if we minimize this these should now disappear let's see it works and look at that it did now we only have our main column which is what we wanted on smaller devices so that works really really nicely so you can see how useful this visibility class is in boots Jeff it's very very useful so that your website will look perfect on particular device types so let's go ahead and maximize this again and there you can see we've got our inside columns back now it works both ways we can actually only display elements on small devices let's say this column 7 right here we only want to display this on small devices let's go ahead and do that we can do that too I just want to show you this as an example so let's close this out and let's go down to where that column 7 is it's right here and so of course what do we do we type in visible again and this time we're gonna put - X s and of course that is for extra small devices so the very very small resolution so let's save this and let's reload our page and now if this works we should not see the column 7 in the larger resolution and it is not there so now let's go ahead and minimize this let's scroll down and there you can see it now appears on the smaller resolution so once again you can see how nicely this visibility class works it's very very powerful and it allows you to tailor base your website to the particular device types
