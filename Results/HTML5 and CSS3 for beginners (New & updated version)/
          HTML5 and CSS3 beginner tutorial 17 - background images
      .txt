hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 17 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to work with background images in CSS so this is kind of somewhat a little bit related to the box model and I thought before we move on from the box model I might as well just show you guys this as well so right now I have a paragraph in my browser this is the same paragraph that we've had for the past couple tutorials just the paragraph that says style me and I have a red border around it so to take a look at the HTML it's literally just that paragraph obviously I've linked to my external stylesheet and my external style sheet has some rules to change the font border and obviously add a little bit of padding for this little space over here which you know if you follow the previous tutorial you know we've already talked about that right so now that we've done padding and border and margin I just want to show you a little bit more that that can be done with our boxes using background images and background colors so if I take a look at my files over here here I've got my index file my CSS is inside the CSS folder and I've gone ahead and added two images so one is a really small selfie of me cheeky little selfie there and one of them is a background a very large background image of a sunset so let's take a look at that as you can see is quite a large image the dimensions here are you know 2500 pixels so it's really big and then I have this really small image of me and this is just a selfie that I've started using across most of my social medias you guys probably recognize it by now right so let's take a look at how background images work and instead of styling the paragraph what I want to do is I want to style my body this is gonna be a plane flying over I hope that's not gonna be too distracting but I want to style my body and yeah this is the body tag over here so what I want to do is this can also be treated like a box we can give it borders and padding's and margins and so on but I don't really want to do that what I do want to do is give it a background image so let's go background and you'll see that we've got background which is a shortcut we've also got background image which is one of the properties we can use background repeat' attachments I'm gonna explain a bunch of these but for now let's just use background image because I know I want to work with an image and then I'm going to add in URL and open up some quotation marks within these two well parentheses or brackets and over here in between these quotation marks I need to put in the file path to my image now remember my CSS file is over here which means I need to go back one folder and then I need to go to my image which is called background large dots jpg so I'm gonna copy that name paste that name in here but like I said relative to where my CSS file is because my CSS file is here I need to go back one folder how do I do that well I can say dot dot slash or I can just go back to the root directory by using a slash symbol so we know that the root root directory is I htdocs directory I'm gonna go ahead and hit save come back here and hit refresh and take a look at that now the background has changed it's almost completely dark because we're only getting like the top corner of this image we're only getting like this black section so we can change the size of our background image using the background size property background size and I'm going to either we can either set a pixel value for this so I can set something like 250 pixels by 160 pixels or something like that and that'll scale my image to only be 250 pixels by a hundred and sixty pixels so if I come back here and hit refresh now you can see the image has been made a lot lot smaller but it also is doing this weird thing where it repeats so we've got one then the next one then the next one the next one then the next one and the reason why it does that is because by default background images will repeat so there's also this next property called background repeat' and you can set that equal to none all right and what that'll do is there's a background repeat none or background repeating no maybe it's no come back here Oh save hmm background repeat none no sorry it is no repeats gosh that one's confusing right so let's come back here and hit refresh and now our background doesn't repeat and I actually want to talk about this value a little bit more next but before I play around with that let's come back to background size because like I said we can either do a background size with pixel values or I can set a background value of cover now what covered is it makes our background image as big as the browser window is so if I save this and come back here and hit refresh you can see that what it's done is it's made the background image fits the browser right and if the background or the browser gets bigger the background image gets bigger the background or the browser gets smaller the background image gets smaller so as long as I keep resizing my bright browser like that you can see it keeps changing sizes so that is one really cool and neat feature about background size now that we've talked about background size I want to talk to you guys about background repeat' so let's remove that value and I'm gonna swap images so right now I'm using the background large but let's swap that to use my selfie image which is called selfie so now it's gonna use this one come back here save jump back over to the browser hit refresh and now you can see we're using the smaller image so it doesn't quite fit the browser all that well and it's repeating and this is a pretty cool image to use for the background repeat' property so we already know that I can set this to no-repeat and the image doesn't repeat right then I can also set this equal to repeat X which will repeat it along the x axis and the x axis is the horizontal axis going across I think there we go yeah so the x axis is the horizontal axis going across and this kind of looks like if you went to one of those photo booths maybe and you printed a picture although usually those go down right not across so to get a better effect of that I could probably say repeat why come back here hit refresh and now we have the images going or repeating but one below the other going on the what is it's the vertical axis right so that is how to use the background repeat' property then I also want to show you guys that we've got something called background color so you'll notice let me let me put the other picture back in here background - large stock jpg I'm gonna take away background repeat' but I'm gonna put in background sighs back to cover again so let's come back here and hit refresh okay so now you can see we've got the background image here but this text doesn't show up all that well it's there I mean I can see it today but it's not showing Apple that well so something I could do is maybe come back over to my paragraph and change the color to red come back here save that and hit refresh and so that makes the text a little bit more visible right but instead of changing the color of the text let's say I wanted to use black text so instead of changing the color of the text I can change the color of the background so I can change the background color of my paragraph to white or I could use the hexadecimal color of whites which is a hashtag FFF has learned in a previous tutorial come back yeah hit refresh and now you can see I've got a white background on my paragraph and I could also do that for my body if I jump back of you I could also set a background color for my body it would just be hidden by the image unfortunately okay so this tutorial is getting a little bit long and there's still kind of a lot of stuff I want to show you so I'm going to stop the video here and then I'm going to pick it up in the next video where I'll show you guys how to use the shorthand property I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me
