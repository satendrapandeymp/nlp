hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 31 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at the float and clear properties in CSS okay so in this video I'm just going to explain the basics but in the next video we're actually going to use floats and clear to do something a little bit more complicated and that is to make a three column layout for a website so I'm going to show you guys how to do that in the next video so get Keane okay but in this video let's go ahead and just learn the basics I'm going to show you guys how to float an image to the side and then clear the image as well so let's look at my directory structure here all my files okay so I've got my index file and my CSS file which you guys know about because we've been working about working with these for a long time and then I've also got me dot jpg which is a picture of me so look how handsome I am right there just kidding but let's go over here now and just add that picture of me and we'll put in some content so image and then I'm going to give this a source of me dot jpg because that's the images name and just if you guys have your images in sub directories like so if this picture was in another picture called images then just remember to use your full directory path I do talk about that in a directory structures video so if you guys don't know what I'm talking about go back and watch that okay so image source is equal to me and the alt attribute for this can just be pick of me and not that it's necessary in for now but let's go ahead now and add in a width and a height okay and I happen to know that this image if I click on it here is 200 by 200 so 200 by 200 and the last thing I want to do with this image is give it a class of pick okay then I'm also going to go ahead and add in some content over here so I'll open up a paragraph and close it off and duplicate that so we have two paragraphs actually okay and instead of you guys watching me type out a whole bunch of mumbo-jumbo I'm going to go ahead and just copy something from over here and paste it in so cool and again over here control C control V and if you guys don't know what's going on here then don't worry it's not English so you're not meant to understand that is actually Latin and it's just there as filler content for if you are ever a web designer and you just want to pull a website up with some content do you see what it would look like if there are sentences or words or something on it then you go ahead and just paste in some filler content but let's just minimize those for now and yeah so right now we have an image and two paragraphs so let's go ahead and take a look at this in the browser Ranchin run and launch in Firefox so that we've got an image of me and we have a paragraph and another paragraph okay now let's take a look at float and clear so go to CSS and grab this picture bias class so I gave it a class of pic and let's go ahead and select that like pick and we can look at the float property first which is float and I'm going to give this a value of lift so this can have two different values they can have float left or float right so let's float it left quickly and it's probably not going to look very different if we go back into the browser the image isn't going to move anywhere but what actually happens is it gets floated so this paragraph that's underneath here should actually jump up and wrap around the image well actually both the better we're also going to do that so click refresh and as you can see we now have two paragraphs that are wrapped pretty much around our image it doesn't look like they're wrapped because they weren't long enough so let's go over here just open up this paragraph and I'm gonna make it double its size so just copy and paste it twice and go back here click refresh now we have our paragraphs actually wrapping around the image so you can see that a lot keep more clearly now this is something that you guys do you see quite often if you read news on the internet or something and they include a picture and the article this you do see quite often in that art in articles like that but sometimes people decide well hey they'd really like a paragraph next to the picture but then the paragraph after that the second paragraph should actually appear on the bottom okay then we have to go ahead and use a property called clear so let me make that smaller and on my second paragraph over here I'm going to give this a class of para 2 because it's the second paragraph and we can go ahead and select that paragraph over here so dot para - and I will give this a property of clear okay and what clear does is just make sure that whatever element that you were giving this clear attribute to or this clear property to will clear whatever is floated above it okay so in other words it'll appear underneath whatever is floated above it so because our image was floated left we can go ahead and say clear left and when we clear the left then go over to Firefox click refresh our paragraph over here which was actually on the side of the image has now just appeared beneath the image okay so we've actually cleared this image and if I go ahead now and change our pic to float right so float right I'm not going to change this clear just yet so you can see what happens click refresh and as you can see we now have the paragraph over here and again the second paragraph is still wrapping around the image because instead of clearing the right we actually cleared the left but the image is actually floated right now so to fix that we could go ahead and say clear right but what I'm going to do is set this to clear both and what this will do is clear the left and the right so just in case you don't know which side the floated elements is going to be like you don't know if it's going to be floated left or floated right you can go ahead and clear both and that will clear both sides so let's click refresh and as you can see instead of having this paragraph start over here and wrap around the image it is now beneath the image so that's pretty cool and of course in the next video we're actually going to use float and clear to make like a three column layout so I hope I will see you guys in that video and that's all I have for you guys in this video so thank you very much for watching don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I will see you guys next time
