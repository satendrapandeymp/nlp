welcome to the 35th tutorial on beginning CSS in this video we're going to look at how to fix the position of an element and basically all we do is switch the position property to fixed and the best way to show you how the fixed position works is to use it against an element that's in an absolute position and one thing also I want to point out is that you use the top and left properties so it's the same thing both will use those both the fixed and the absolute so there's no difference there the only difference is we are going to absolutely keep this element in a fixed position it will not move and I mean that literally now the best way to show you again is to show you how it works against an element that's in an absolute position so let's actually resize this browser and the way to see this is actually when you use the scrollbar so let's let's resize this a little bit up here okay so if I scroll this you see how that div 1 is not moving it will not move it does not adjust accordingly it will stay 10 pixels from the top it will not move from that top position you can see that it's not moving whereas the elements in absolute position are and so that's really it that's the main difference it's pretty easy to understand now I will tell you that I do not use fixed positioning very much I prefer to use absolute positioning and the reason is I think it's a little bit unnerving I guess to the people that are browsing your web page I think it's more natural to have the elements move accordingly but there may be some times you will want to use fixed positioning and I've noticed in some websites they will use this for advertisements right and they want to make sure it's always plastered in the window frame and so you can't really get rid of it it will always stay in a particular spot but again I prefer absolute positioning and also I like the float elements and use elements in the flow and so again I don't use fixed as much but I wanted to show you what it was all about now there is yet another parameter that we can put in here it's called relative yes there is relative positioning but that's really for a more advanced CSS tutorial and actually I don't even really use that a lot either I get unpredictable results with relative positioning but maybe in a future series I will talk about that
