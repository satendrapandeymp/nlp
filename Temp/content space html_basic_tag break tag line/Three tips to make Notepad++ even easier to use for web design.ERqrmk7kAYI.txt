specialize text editors do make things more convenient they can help as you write code edit multiple files and push files to and from the remote web server so in the next few minutes I'm going to show you how to download install and configure a text editor called notepad plus plus by the time we're done you'll be ready to write and manage any number of web pages using any number of web languages including HTML and CSS notepad plus plus is a free program for windows and you can download it by going to notepad - plus plus org in your web browser on the left hand side scroll down and click the

installation process this should take just a few minutes when you're finished make sure that the run notepad button is selected and hit finish that will open up a new notepad window in the background now in your notepad window go ahead and create a new file by going to file new the first thing that we're going to need to do is specify which programming or markup language we're going to be working in this helps notepad + + know what sort of code highlight highlighting to do for us right now the program is treating this file as a normal text file we needed to treat it as an HTML file to do this go up to the language menu and under H choose HTML you'll notice now that the document type is being read as a hypertext markup language file or an HTML file let's paste some HTML code into this to see what it looks like now you can see that the editor adds some colouring and highlighting to the code and we'll continue to add highlighting as you work when your code to make it more easily read now rather than having to choose HTML each time we open open a document let's assume that we want to make HTML the default for each new document to do this go up to the settings menu and choose preferences now click on the new document default directory tab and in the default language drop-down open that up and choose HTML while you're at it go ahead and click utf-8 under the encoding option when you're done with that click close now if we open up a new web page or open up a new document you'll see that it is recognized as a hypertext markup language file by default when we save the file it will automatically save it as an HTML type file sometimes it's hard to remember exactly which tag to use or what all the options are for a tag as you're coding up your document so let's turn on a help prompt feature that should be of assistance to do this go up to the settings tab and under preferences choose the backup slash auto-completion tab here click on both of these boxes the enable auto completion on each input and the function parameters hint on input and then click close now as you type tags into your HTML document you'll get a drop-down list with all of the different HTML tags you can use with some of the suggested tags already highlighted based on what you've typed I can then double click on the h1 and it'll finish my tag and I can continue typing now let's take it a step further by adding a plug-in that will help us with some auto completion options for our tags because notepad plus plus is open source and is so popular many developers have created handy tools that can be added to the note plus notepad plus plus interface let's add a plug-in called text FX that will help us keep our tags properly closed so to do this we need to go to the plugins menu and then scroll down to the plug-in manager then click on show plug-in manager here what we'll pull up is a list of all of the available plugins that are currently out there for notepad plus plus the one that we want is the text FX characters plug-in which you can see here to install it check the box and then click the install button that plug-in will be downloaded and then you'll be prompted to restart notepad plus plus go to and click yes I'm not going to save any of my files and I'm going to open up a new window now you'll notice that we have another menu here the text FX menu click on that and then go down to the text FX settings and make sure that the auto closed XHTML / XML option is selected if it is now as you begin to type your HTML tags notepad plus plus will go ahead and auto close that tag for you so this is my headline and then hit the end key to jump out or I can use my arrow keys to jump in and out and I can continue to code up my document with my in tags Auto being being auto filled we're almost there let's add on one more plugin to make managing your files easier because most websites are going to include more than one directory and more than one file so to make these files easier to manage we're going to add a file manager view to notepad plus plus using a plug-in called Explorer we can get the Explorer plug-in by going to plugins plugin manager show plugin manager and then from the list that pops up scrolling down to the Explorer plug-in here click install as before I'll be prompted to restart after downloads and installs I have the option to save no I don't need to save I'm going to hit ctrl n to open up a new window now we activate the plugin by going to plugins and we have a new explorer option here and then we click on the first option here Explorer now over here on the left we have a tree view of all of the files and drives on our computer where we can then go in and create edit and delete folders and files now there are thousands of other ways that you can tweak notepad plus plus but this should be enough to get you started as you've seen just because notepad plus plus is free doesn't mean it's not an excellent piece of software as well
