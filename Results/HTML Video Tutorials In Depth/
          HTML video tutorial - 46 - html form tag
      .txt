hello friends welcome to HTML tutorial series I double click on default dot HTML page I right-click on the default dot HTML page open with the notepad in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML forms HTML forms are one of the most important part of every website HTML forms have variety of applications using HTML forms we can create login form or a sign-in form data entry form feedback forms online application forms and query forms etc etc to create a form we are going to use HTML form tag so I write here fo RM opening form tag the form tag is a paid attack so I must and should write closing form tag and it is a block level tag that also we should remember form tag has few important attributes I am going to discuss about them here first attribute is a name attribute equal to in double quotations I have to give value that is going to be name of the form to give a name of the form I am going to follow some steps first thing is prefix for any input control I am going to use a prefix if it is a form then I write a prefix frm if it is a textbox I use a prefix txt if it is a radio button then I can say our DB radio button something like that I am going to use prefix first I am going to write a prefix FR m FR m indicates form then i am going to write name of the form actually if it is a login form then i say here login we are going to read it something like this login form if it is a data entry form then i say here data entry i am going to read it as data entry form you can see that i am following a camel case naming convention we have three words here one is form another one is data another one is entry first words all characters are in a small letter and next words first character should be capital that is how the camel case note is followed and there should not be any space in between the words and also you should remember that the name that you give to a form or any input control you must and should give a meaningful name why because we are going to use this name and access this name in a processing page that means we are going to access this form by this name in a JavaScript file or a server-side file like a PHP file or a ASP file so that is the main purpose of the name attribute next attribute we have is action the value for the action attribute is the page which is going to process this form let's take if the same page is a processing page then I am going to write here d EF a ult default dot HTML page if my form is processed by some other page then I am going to write that page name here let's take I am going to create one more HTML page I go to start run then I say here notepad I say here HTML closing HTML then I say here head closing head body closing body then in between here I say processing page . i give the title TI tle title title is also going to be processing page i just give some information here closing title file save as i am going to save the file with the name as PR OC e double SS or processor dot HTML save it a desktop here i am going to give processor dot HTML when i submit the form all the data in the form is going to be sent to this file now this page is going to process the form that means the processor dot HTML page might contain some validation code maybe it is going to contain database related things like inserting or updating the database or entering the data into database any code it might contain Paige that we give to action attribute it might be a server-side file also it might be a PHP file it might be an asp.net file any file might process your form whichever file processes that file name you have to give here that is about action next property we have is method there are two ways in which we can send the data in the form to the processing page those are either in a get method or in a post method both the methods have different properties or different limitations and different advantages I am going to discuss about them little bit later so there are two methods get method and post method remember that file save go to browser refresh form tag is the container for various input controls anything related to the form you must and should put in between these two tags hope you guys have understood what is the purpose of form tag and its attributes for this tutorial this much is enough guys in the next tutorial we get more information on HTML forms for more benefits please subscribe like comment and share see you in the next tutorial keep learning keep coding keep sharing
