in this video I want to look at how you can use JavaScript to create HTML element Dom elements on the fly in code so what happened in the previous video if I if i run this p5.js project you can see here there are some there's a there's an h1 element there's a paragraph element and there's a canvas where did those things come from so the clips in the previous video I looked at how in in the HTML file you can add things inside body like this h1 element gets added and appears on the page this paragraph elements gets added and appears on the page but there's a canvas on the page I don't see the canvas here so how did that canvas get added the way that canvas got got added was in JavaScript create canvas 200 200 so if you want to have things already on the page that you want to sort of like manually set their layout and content you can put that stuff in the HTML file if you want your code to generate elements you can generate those elements from your p5 file and in this scenario I'm generating just the canvas now incidentally you could certainly manually add a canvas as a tag and access it from JavaScript but this is not something that I'm really doing in these videos I want to sort of focus on the the canvas is kind of where p5 is kind of like a special case in and create canvas using p5 is kind of a nice way of just quickly getting the case off to the page that aside what I want to look at is what if you want your code to make the paragraph or what if you want your code to make that header element and of how does that work so you can see to make the canvas I said create canvas magic erased whiteboard because I had a technical difficulty but now I'm back here so what I'll do here now is make a list of some of these other create functions so you know that there is create canvas this makes a canvas appear on the page and then there are several other create blank func available P 5gs to add other kinds of HTML elements so here are a few create P create div create button create image IMG the list goes on and on and on and on so in the in the description of this video when I upload it I'll add a link to the dom reference where you can see all of these is a list of all these functions so let's now now a couple things about this all of these are going to need some sort of argument that goes in here and it's going to be different so what do you need to create a paragraph versus what do you need to create a button create sliders a really interesting one that I would like to get to at some point but let's start off simply with just create P ah and I forgot sort of a crucial detail but let's start off with create P and I'll come back to that detail so right here and set up after create canvas I'm going to say create P this is you know what's something besides I don't know my favorite color is purple sometimes it's pink every once a while it's like orange but mostly it's purple you guys need to know this about me okay now here we go and look at this look at that there's another paragraph on the page and I may be a little bit too excited about this I don't usually drink coffee nights of coffee today that idea um so here you can see here's the header then I put in the HTML h1 tag here's the paragraph that I put in the HTML here's the canvas that I created with JavaScript and here's the paragraph that I created with JavaScript so there's a big question here which is why would I do one versus the other and I think what we can do what I could do to answer that question right now is just say just breathe right now it doesn't really matter but at one place put it the other place who really cares um you just want to like experiment play around get stuff happening on the page as I show you s'more and more examples as we go through more and more scenarios I think there will the that question the answer to that question will reveal it themselves the answers were real sells but in other words different scenarios there could be advantages to why you might want to generate some Dom elements on the fly you know maybe you're randomly picking different texts maybe you're making a thousand of them right versus whether you want to like set some stuff up in advance so that's sort of like an important topic I want to revisit that question over and over again right now I just want to see that both are possible okay so and and we can do some weird things like I can add function like I don't have to just do that in setup I can add in the mousepressed function right the mousepressed function which fires anytime I click the mouse anywhere on the page right any time I click look I'm getting another paragraph and I can scroll down we can see and I could start to do things like you know my favorite I could say my favorite number is and then give a random number between 0 and 10 and we give myself a little more room here right now I'm going to run this and you can see click click click I get a different random number and so this is a reason why I might want to generate those elements in JavaScript because I want the number to be random because I want to do it when the user clicks the mouse so I don't know how many times the Jews are going to click the mouse whereas I'm answering the question now I know that at the top I just wanted to say I am making a video so I can put that in the HTML in advance there's no reason for me to create that in JavaScript so this is this balance that we need to strike so create canvas create P there are other ones create button create image creative I my suggestion to you might be just try like adding them in your code see what happens but I do want to emphasize something in this particular sketch there is an h1 element at the top I'll see getting exercise here there is no create h1 function in p5 now you could say to yourself like what why not isn't that an oversight shouldn't there be a create I really think that should be a create h1 and you could have this discussion but I think the point is p5 includes some create X functions for the sort common Dom elements you might want to generate with code there are a lot of kind of HTML tags there's list tags and ordered list tags and under unordered list typing it would be unrealistic and would sort of bloat the reference to have a create plan for every single kind of HTML element for so in all other cases you can always say create element to create element function allows you to make any Dom element any HTML element and the first argument is the tag itself and the second argument is you know the content that goes inside that tag so let's look at adding that right now here if I come back in setup I can say create element h1 and then I can say my favorite numbers below and now when I run this you can see I made this header in a Java Script I made the canvas then this h1 element and now every time I click the mouse I get one of the paragraph elements below so this is what's possible for you now you can this this JavaScript code is sitting is loaded into this page it runs as soon as the page loads the page has some content built into it and then JavaScript add some content to it it adds a canvas it adds an h1 element and add some paragraphs so I think I'm going to stop this end so what I would say to you now is in for your next exercise take the sketch you made before with a few dumb few things in the HTML now try adding some HTML elements from p5 itself using these p5 functions and the next video I'm going to show you some tricks for how to manipulate those elements have them change and do some things on the fly ok so I'm going to stop now and stop
