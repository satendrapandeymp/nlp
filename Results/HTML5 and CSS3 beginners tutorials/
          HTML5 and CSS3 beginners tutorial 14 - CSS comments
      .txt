hey YouTube how's going it's Quinton here and welcome back to tutorial number fourteen and in this tutorial we are going to talk about CSS comments okay so of course CSS comments are used for the same reason as comments in HTML they're just there for you as the programmer or the designer to see what your code was there for okay it's just to leave notes for yourself like why you wrote certain code or just to help other people out and I got a message here but we'll ignore that okay so that's just basically what CSS comments are used for so let's go ahead and take a look at how to use them okay so they're actually really simple and if you guys are wondering where this code comes from this is just the code from the previous tutorial it's just one paragraph and then we change the fonts or whatever okay so to change or to add comments to CSS all you have to do is put in one of those slashes and then a star and as you can see everything kind of turns green and that means that everything after this is a comment until you reach a star and another slash okay so basically this means that our comment starts here and then our comment ends here and everything inside of this is now our comments so we can say CSS from tutorial 13 I guess and that is our comment and then like later on we could actually add notes side notes to ourselves about certain other things as well like for instance this is font weight then font style then font size and then family so you could go ahead and say weight style size and family so now we know what order we were supposed to put these values in when we're using this font shortcut property okay and that's actually all I have for you guys in this video it's quite simple so thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time
