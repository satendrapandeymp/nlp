in this video we're going to learn how to use a glyph icon in bootstrap so let's go ahead and we'll add it to our existing navbar that we've been working on in the last several videos so let's go ahead and fire up what we've got so far and what we want to do is put two new buttons over here a login button and a contact button and what we want to do is add bootstrap Clif icons to those as well but first let's go ahead and create the buttons so we can just borrow what we coded here so we'll just copy this and we'll go right below our existing UL element and we'll copy and paste right here good and we can use these same classes that's all good we don't need an active button so let's go ahead and get rid of that and we obviously only need two buttons so we'll get rid of this Flast one and so for this button again we're gonna call that contact us and then again for this bottom one we're gonna call this login good now we also want to float this to the right so we're gonna go ahead and use that navbar right class that we used in the last video okay great so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and run this in Chrome and let's see what we get there everything looks good now you might be wondering why isn't our search bar all the way to the right shouldn't this be to the far right well it works a little bit differently in bootstrap and I'll show you what happens here so if you have two elements that are using navbar right the first element that uses that class in other words our two buttons that we just created will be placed to the far right so it works in a top-down order so that's why our search bar actually isn't on the far right because it's on the bottom so it'll actually occupy the second position from the right so once again if you have multiple elements that are using this navbar right class the first element that uses it will go to the far right and then so on and so on okay so now what we want to do is go ahead and add our glyph icon now before we do that I want to point out that bootstrap has a page that lists all of these icons and I will provide a link to this in the description of this video so you can pretty much choose whatever icon you want to use here so for our contact us we're going to use this envelope icon right here and this is pretty much a standard icon that is used out on the internet for contact us links and then we're going to use a login icon for our login button so let's go back to the code now how to add this well if you remember in my HTML series we talked about the span element and what is the span element well one of the functions it is used for is to update text and I think in that series we actually highlighted the text well in this case we just want to add an icon to this text and so that's what we're gonna do and we use the span element to do that so let's go ahead and create our span element and then we're gonna call our bootstrap class that goes along with this and the bootstrap class that we're gonna call is glyph icon very appropriately named so it's sort of similar to the button class right we've call a generic button class first and then we actually specify which button we want same thing here we call the glyph icon class first and then we specify the glyph icon that we actually want to use and again we want to use the glyph icon envelope class which we can select right here great and then we just need to go ahead and close out our span now one thing I want to point out here is remember we're adding this icon to our text so you want to leave a space here because this will leave a space between the icon and the text so whenever you're doing this just remember to always leave a space so that looks pretty good so let's go ahead and copy this span because we're gonna use it right below again with our login and let's just go ahead and we'll copy and paste it right here and let's create that space again and then this class actually has a couple more hyphens to it and so we're gonna put log and then you need a hyphen right here I don't know why they did it this way but they did and then you just put in for login and you know what this needs an H boy I'm always making mistakes in these last couple videos probably just typing too fast so there we go I think this looks good now so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and launch this in chrome and let's see what we get and take a look at that we get these awesome looking icons and this adds a nice touch to your website it makes it look very very professional okay that's gonna do it for this video thank you
