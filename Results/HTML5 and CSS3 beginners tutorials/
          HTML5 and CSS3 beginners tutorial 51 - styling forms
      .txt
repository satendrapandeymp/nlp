hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 51 and in this tutorial we're going to take a look at styling forms and by styling forms I'm not talking about different forms of styling no no I am talking about how to style our form elements because we have not done that yet and that is something we're going to have to look at over the course of the next few tutorials so what I've got here is a form and I've actually populated my form or given my form a whole bunch of elements before we started but don't worry they're not like extreme it's not going to be extremely difficult for you guys to understand it's basically just a whole bunch of labels with some input types of text so it wouldn't take you guys long to copy but it's also not going to take I'll also provide a link where you guys can just download the code or something so let's go ahead and actually take a look at this and you can see I've started a paragraph tag and then I've had my label for first name then I've also put in my input type of text for my first name and I ended that paragraph off and basically you can copy that code and paste it down a few times for each of these fields over here so we've got one for last name email city address line 1 and address line 2 they're pretty much all the same just with unique names and unique IDs for each one ok so that's pretty much the end result in the browser but what we really need to do now is style this so that all these input elements actually appear nice and in line or nice and lined up next to each other right now seeing them like in this little wave kind of pattern looks kind of untidy and ugly in my opinion so we're going to fix that with some styling rules now I've got some labels in this field set over here this personal info field set but we also have another field set at the bottom here with hobbies that also has labels for the check boxes and I don't want to accidentally style any of these labels for the check boxes because as you can see the check boxes all seem to look just fine so we're going to go back over to our notepad plus plus over here and I'm going to grab this field set that had or that has the legend of personal info and I'm just going to give this a class so class of a personal underscore info and we might as well just go copy that now save this go over to CSS and select that class now I don't actually want to select this class but what I do want to select is all the labels inside of the field set with this class and to do that we can go ahead now and just leave a space over here and type in the word label and that's going to select all the label elements inside of this personal info class okay and what we're going to do here is just give each one of those labels are fixed width and I'm also going to float them to the left so float left and I'll give it a width of 100 100 pixels okay and what this should do is make all of these labels the same width so when I click refresh you can see all of our labels now have the same width which means that all of these input text boxes over here all appear in line so you know they're all nice and lined up it looks a lot more tidy and something else we could do here is just give this a margin or even a line our text to the right now I prefer having my text aligned to the left I think this looks good just the way it is but some people like to go text-align:right and I'll show you what effect this gives you but it basically means that all of the labels appear next to our elements and then you've got a wide open space over here which I I prefer to have it actually aligned to the left and then you don't have that wide open space but if you're ever going to align your your labels to the right like this you might want to just give yourself a margin as well so margin right and we might just give that a margin of 10 pixels just to add that extra little bit of space so when I click refresh we now have that space over there okay but like I said hi I prefer having my text aligned on the left it just for me in my opinion looks better that way and something else we could do here is maybe just go over to our CSS file and select all of our field sets and just make them a little bit thinner as it were because right now if we take a look at this our field sets take up the entire width of the browser but our data inside of here I'd say isn't even wider than 300 pixels 320 pixels so we might as well go over to our field sets and then just give these a width of 320 pixels and that should make the actual field sets just a lot smaller and in fact it could probably be even smaller than that so let's make it 300 and you know that probably looks a lot better now just you know just so that we don't have any of that like really unnecessary space all along the side okay and obviously you would put this these field sets or this form inside of another element that you could use to Center it in the middle of the page or something like that but I have already made a tutorial on that so if you guys want to learn how to do that look back to the previous tutorials and you will see how to Center parts of your webpage okay something else we could do if we really decided or deemed it necessary is to give our field sets some background color so background color and we could get a like a very light blue color so I've got I've got this file over here or this color over here i hack she had to pause and just go over to photoshop and select any color and when we go over to Firefox now and click refresh we have this really light blue background and that can probably help you guys just to create a different look between the background of the normal website and the background of your form and obviously something else we could do that might improve this a little bit more is to actually make our header or our field set legend bolded so we can grab all of the legends inside of our field set by typing field set legend like that and then we can go ahead and just say font-weight:bold and that should bold the the actual characters so it definitely looks a little bit better bolded although it is kind of weird having half of it appear on the white and half of it appear on the blue so maybe changing the background color wasn't such a great idea after all and we can go ahead and maybe actually get rid of that background color then and actually see what this looks like a part it's pretty can it look so much better yeah okay so that's all I have for you guys in this video and as always don't
