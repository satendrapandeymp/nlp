hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in this video tutorial we are going to design this layout it is little bit complex you can see and let's see how do we design it I go to start open notepad I type here typical HTML structure opening HTML closing HTML opening head tag closing head tag opening body tag closing body tag in the head section I am going to create title and say layout using div closing title we create this layout completely by using the only file save as la Vie o UT layout 3 dot HTML both sides I put double quotation save the file at desktop right click on it open with the Firefox you can see the file got open and we proceed further first thing is I am going to create the container so let's start so I say div id container it is going to have a style Styles is going to be width of 900 pixel then it is going to have border of 1 pixel solid black then that's it closing div let me put some content so that we can see the height container file save good browser and refresh you see that the container got created let's align it to the center by using the margin attribute margin Auto file save your browser and refresh can see that the container or the DV is aligned to the center we know that the overall width is 900 plus 2 pixels 902 pixels remember that inside this div we only we are going to create remaining leaves so here I am going to create a div ID of head this is going to become a header so style I am going to set width of 900 pixel of course this divs width is 900 pixel for this Deval so I'm setting the 900 pixel only semicolon and it is going to have background - color of orange double quotation and I close this div at present I put the content as head file save Core browser and refresh you can see that the head got created with the orange color now inside this I am going to create three divs Dave style width of 200 pixels and height also I am one set heig HD height also 200 pixels only I set with 200 pixel height 200 pixel and then I set the background color background - color of red and clothes this day I copy this div and create three divs total three divs we need right you can see here I need three divs one two three one is in red one is in green and one is in blue I am going to create one more extractive I'm going to talk about that why I am creating this is going to be in yellow color let's see now file save your browser and refresh you can see that one two three four divs are created now I am going to float them one beside another to do that we know that we are going to use float property so here I say float l aft left semicolon once i float the red we know that green blue and yellow are moved up file save go to browser and refresh you can see that green is now behind the red Dave so I float that also semicolon FL o 80 float le ft left semicolon file save code browser and refresh now red and green are one beside another floated left blue and yellow are moved up similarly for this also I set float:left and fellow 80 float le ft left semicolon file save your browser and refresh you can see that red green blue or one beside another only yellow is moved inside I want that yellow Dave should not get affected by the float effect so what I can do is I can say here CL EA are clear le aft left floating on it file save go browser and refresh you can see that the yellow came back if I do not have this yellow div and extra file save code browser and refresh you can see that this border is collapsed you can see that the height of the head is reduced to 0 pixels because as we have floated all the three divs which are present in the head they all are floated up as there is nothing inside the head Dave the height collapsed 2-0 pixel there should be something right that is the reason I have added one extra div inside so that it should not get collapse file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it is came back and I set it to clear float:right so what we can do is we can remove this styles from that if I remove the style all styles except clear left freyal save go to browser and refresh you can see that we have this container height as it is right the container height not collapse to zero pixels because we have one div we have one div which is making the clear:left effect so that is the reason we are saying this properly next thing what I do is I am going to set the margin around is div so to do that I am going to use margin attribute margin of 10 pixel margin so I copy that and paste it for remaining leaves paste and paste file save your browser and refresh you can see now we have margin around all I need is I need to align them properly so let's understand here what we have here we have 10 pixel margin 10 plus 200 210 here we have 20 pixel margin so 230 400 and 200 plus 200 is 400 430 and here we have 20 450 plus 200 so 650 we have so we need to make it overall 900 what I do is I set this div with to 560 let's see what happens now file save go to browser and refresh this is more you can see 560 is more let it bring it properly let me bring 200 plus 560 is more let me reduce it to 500 first file save Core browser and refresh now we have 200 plus 500 is 700 plus 200 is 900 900 plus 20 is more you can see so we need to reduce 480 10 plus 10 is 20 so I made it 480 here also 10 plus 10 is 20 I reduce it to 460 file save your browser and refresh let's see again this devolve so we have ten and ten so I have to reduce more twenty pixels file save your browser and refresh that makes the exact 900 but you can do calculation also if you want 200 plus 20 is 220 220 plus 20 is 240 240 plus 20 is 260 260 plus 440 is 700 700 plus 200 900 you can see that we got the required result that we were expecting in this right similarly I can create two more dips below this header so here this is wrong here I create two more dips opening Dave and a closing Dave and this Dave is going to have style width off I said 300 pixels width and it is going to have height hei GST height of 400 pixels 400 pixels and background color of tsiyon semicolon similarly I am going to create one more div paste it and this is going to have 500 height also same file save go to browser and refresh you can see that two divs created one beside one below another what I can do is I can set floating so here I said float only aft left semicolon here and also I said FL away T float only aft left semicolon file save what happens you will see you should see that this border collapsed to the height of the head if i refresh you can see the border is collapsed to the height it is said to the height of the header because we don't have anything below the header now because these two divs are floated to get that broader back what I can do is I can set this div and say here style equal to clear le aft left semicolon then I can close this Dave file save your browser and refresh you can see that now I am getting the border right and only thing is the total width is 500 plus 300 is 800 so if I set it to 600 that becomes proper 900 can see that and what we can do is I I just want to assign the margin around these divs so I need to modify few things first thing I set here ma our margin of 10 pixel margin I select 10px for this also I said ma our GI and margin of 10 pixel as I add margin automatically the width increases so I need to do some calculations so 20 pixels 20 pixels we are adding so 20 pixel 20 pixel means I have reduced here total 60 so I set it to 560 file save your browser and refresh you can see that I have a margin around properly as well as the divs are properly placed they are not moved down this is how you need to do calculation and create the layout friends similarly in this I can create two divs in this I can create for dibs it's very easy all I need is I am going to copy this div and paste inside copy this div and paste inside here and divs are going to have 200 210 pixel margins so I copy that paste it down so this this div is the header and this div is going to be an ID I set section 1 and in that we have two divs these students file save your browser and refresh of course gives are created but you cannot see them let me do some modifications I change the color sign to Li GST light GRE Y gray for this also same thing I do write Li gh T light GRE y gray file save cor browser and refresh in see two divs are God created light grey but they are not exactly inside the dabes one solution is we can increase the height or we can modify few things let me set them to 180 pixel by 180 pixels because we are having margin also as we have margin we have to reduce 20 20 pixels file save go to browser and refresh in height or we need to reduce 180 pixel this also I set it to 180 pixel file save your browser and refresh can see now they are inside the div properly if we want to increase we can increase the width there is no problem because we can increase the width so we can set it to 200 can set this also to 200 file save your browser and refresh and see that now same thing I can do for the section 2 also I can copy that and this one is going to be having the ID of section 2 and in this div I am going to put two divs and they are floated left file save go to browser and refresh you can see they are floated one beside another and one of the thing you need to understand here is in the section 1 I am floating these two divs left even though if I do not float them left also no problem because thief by default gives our block level they get create one below another so refresh I need not to mention here float left actually for these two deals but here I have to mention float left because I want these two divs to be one beside another similarly I copy this and paste two more times here and I'm gonna set for this div clear left floating if I say like that refresh the divs are going to come down so that is how you are going to create the design that you are expecting and be left with only the footer so footer we can create very easily all I need is I have one extra Dave this one this div is going to become a footer ID footer and I set the properties on it so this is going to have two width of 900 pixels 900 pixel then I have here hei GST height of 50 pixel then it is going to have background - color of black and it should have clear left file/save core browser and refresh and see that now we have the footer also right and at the end what I can do is I can remove the border that we have for the container file save guru browser and refresh as we have removed the border this is how it looks and what I actually want is I want to set the background color instead of the border so here I said B ACK gru in the background - color I want is light gray color semicolon file save guru browser and refresh can see that now our layout looks more better I hope you guys have understood how do we design the web page layout I suggest you people to understand this code step by step from
