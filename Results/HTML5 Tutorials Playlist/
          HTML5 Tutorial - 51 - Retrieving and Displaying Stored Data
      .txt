alright guys welcome to your 51st and last tutorial of this miniseries so basically what we did right now is we built some functions that allowed us to enter two little pieces of information and whenever we click the Save button it's going to go ahead and save those to a variable however I could say oh yeah just trust me whenever you click the Save button it's going to save it to a variable it's also going to put a million dollars in your bank account and cure you know whatever disease you might have but you know you aren't going to believe me unless I can prove it to you guys so the truth is it's not going to give you a million dollars or doing anything like that but it is going to save a variable so how am I going to prove this to you guys well I'm going to display the information of that variable right here so what we want to do right after we save the variable is and typically you wouldn't just you know save a variable and display the information right to them or else that'd be kind of worthless you won't even need you know session storage for that but just for this example it's the only way that I can prove it to you guys so now what I want to do is display the information in one so what this is going to do is basically show you the information in the right-hand side right here so this is a function that we actually need to code but it only takes about three lines I'm guessing so function and it's called display we just go ahead and copy this stuff right here it's called display and it takes a parameter of what the parameter is basically the name of your variable so in this case it's just one so the very first line we need to basically reference this blue box right here so in order to do that I'm just going to go ahead and make a variable called right box and I'm going to go ahead and cheat a little bit here document make sure again my equal signs document.getelementbyid now the ID of this right box was right box so now basically this right box right here symbolizes this blue box on our screen now after this what I want to do is I want to retrieve the data from that variable so right here I said okay what this line of code does is it saves a variable on the computer well now that we have some information saved I want to tell you guys how to access that information so for variable I'm just going to go ahead and name this - - right like that what I want to do is hit session storage and remember session storage is basically the class that is built-in that allows us to save and retrieve variables so whenever we needed to set a variable we use the method set item whenever we want to retrieve a variable we need to use the function get item now get item only takes one parameter and it's basically what is the name of your item well we passed the end the name right here which was one now basically we're passing it in the name of person person is the name of our variable or item as they might call it oh yeah I just noticed that I use the terms like function and method interchangeably I also use the term item and variable interchangeably but I don't want to confuse you guys whenever I say item or variable it's basically the same thing it's basically data that you can store that has a value so basically our item or variable is named a person so that is what we're passing in right here so now we're saying okay get the value of the in store it in the variable called - so the value of person is Bucky so now whenever we use the variable - it should write Bucky so now what I wanted to do is just output this in my right hand side of the screen right here in my right box so I'm just going to go ahead and hit right box inner HTML this basically means whatever is inside here replace it with whatever I type in here now for the inner HTML let me just go ahead and write something like name a variable and I'm just going to go ahead and make this equal to one because remember the name of your variable is basically person so whenever we save this it should say the name of your variable is person and whenever you want to append a string in JavaScript you need to use these two little plus signs if you don't know what this is then go ahead and watch my JavaScript orioles so now what I want to do is on the next line in order to move down to the next line I'm just going to add a break and I'm just going to write value and that's probably good enough the value is and I'm just going to go ahead and append the variable to so remember like I said one is basically the name of the item and two is basically we retrieved the value of the item so let me go ahead and save this and make sure this works so I'm going to go ahead and refresh this beach person has a value of Bucky now let's go ahead and save it the name of the variable is person and the value is Bucky this could also write the name of the item is person and its value is Bucky so let's go ahead and make another one person um [Music] Ashley so whenever we store I want to mention this just like JavaScript whenever we try to store something else it pretty much over writes this person so it says okay you already have a variable called person but now you're sending it equal to a different value so whenever we do that it pretty much over writes it and gives it a new value so this pretty much works the exact same as JavaScript except you know it's just a little bit different it's for websites instead so what I'm going to be doing is I know this is kind of confusing and even though we can just save everything in variables these variables right here they can't be saved as you go from website to website to website or gives any webpage to a web page as soon as you go to a different web page these variables right here are going to get destroyed so that is why we need to use this web storage API it gives us the ability to do some cool things aside from just storing variables from web page to web page and let's just do some other cool things too which I'm going to be talking about in the upcoming tutorials but anyways like I said I know all of this is really using so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be taking all of this code and I'm going to be putting it on my forum tnb form comm and if you want it just go ahead and copy it and just play with it a little bit and once you guys play with it for just a little bit you're going to see how it works why it works and you know it's going to make sense to you guys I promise so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe I need to go get a drink at apple juice or some anyways I'm going to go get a drink and I will see you guys in the next lesson
