in this lesson we're gonna learn how to create links inside our website so can actually navigate around the website visiting pages such as to mom created in the previous episode called contact of HTML so what I'm going to do here is we're not gonna build a navigation we're gonna do that in the next episode and in this episode I'm just gonna focus on explaining what exactly the link is so as you guys can see in front of me here I have my front page and inside my front page I want to include a link that links to my contact page inside my website because it were to take a look at the website you guys can see that I can't go to my contact page unless I go inside the URL and manually type in 'contact dot HTML and now we have the contact page so we want to be able to jump to this page without having to actually change anything up inside the URL because users won't know you have a contact page unless you actually do something to lead them inside the contact page so they won't actually go up inside the UL and type contact at HTML so inside my front page the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go underneath my paragraph that says welcome to my personal portfolio blah blah blah and I'm going to create something we call an anchor now an anchor is a pair of text we wrap around whatever we want to link to a certain sub page we have inside our website or some external page that we have on the internet somewhere so what I'm gonna gonna do here is I'm going to create an anchor tag by writing lesser than a greater than and then I'm gonna go ahead and close the tag so I'm gonna say lesser then /a greater than now before we insert anything in between the anchor tags there's one thing need to include inside the starting tag because we need to have an attribute called href which stands for Hyper reference which will contain a link to the place that we want to take the user once he clicks on the thing that is in between the tags here so I can say href is equal to double quotes and then I would like to take the user to a contact page now if I want to take the user to the contact page if we were to go inside my root folder you guys can see that we have a document here called contact of HTML which is right next to our index page which is the one that we're inside of right now inside the text editor so what I can do I can say contact dot HTML directly inside the hyper reference now if my page here was actually to be inside a subfolder so were to right-click create a folder called pages and then insert the page inside my pages folder so right now the contact page is not inside next to the index page I would have to go inside the hyper reference and say that we need to access a folder called pages forward slash contact at HTML because now we're taking into a folder and then finding the document okay so the path to the page that we want to link to has to be relevant to where the current document that we're inside of is actually positioned so because the index pages inside the main the main directive the root folder we then need to dig in to a folder called pages okay so I'm just gonna redo what we did here because I just wanted to explain it to you and now I'm gonna go back inside our code remove pages forward slash because you don't need that and I'm going to insert some text in between the anchor tags because we need to actually have something to click on because it were to refresh my website here you guys can see if you have nothing new so if I were to say visit my contact page here exclamation mark go inside my website you guys can see we now have a link if I were to click it you can see that we jump inside the contact page so now we have this working now I would like to be taken back to the front page because we don't want to get stuck in here so I'm going to go back inside my document copy the anchor tag go inside my contact page and just include it here at the bottom so I'm going to say to want to link to index that HTML instead and then I want to change the text to visit my front page like so so now if i refresh the browser you guys can see that we can jump back to the front page now another thing you can also do just to show to you guys is that you don't have to wrap the entire piece of text inside an anchor tag if we were to take the beginning tag copy it delete it and insert a right before here you guys can see here's to be the only text and links to the front page from the contact page so who were to go inside my browser and just go back inside the contact page now the word here is the only thing that links back to the front page just to show you guys now the next thing I went to sir guys is that we don't have to link to a sub page using an anchor tag so what should go inside my browser and go to the font dot come copy a link up here in the top go back inside my code I can actually paste in the link from the font that come save it go back inside my website here refresh and now if I go inside my contact page because this is what we edited inside the code if I click this link it'll actually take us to dafont.com so we can also use external links inside our anchor tags now as you guys may notice when I did actually click the link it opened up inside the same window if we want to open up in a different window what we can do is I can go ahead and set a nother attribute called target which is going to be equal to underscore blank if it were to go back inside the website refresh and now click the link you guys can see it opens up in a different tab which is much more nice when you want to take people to an external page because you want to keep people inside your website now you might be asking well do we have to use text inside a link well no you don't have to so if I were to go ahead and take the text here go down a couple of lines just you have to anchor take opening on one line and then closing on an on a different line I could then go ahead and create something like an optic so if we were to create a dip box which is just a pair of tags save it and then style the div tags inside my CSS file so we say we have a div curly brackets it should have a width as maybe 300 pixels a height set to 200 pixels and a background color so we can actually see it I can then set it to green like so I can then go inside my website refresh and you guys can see we now have a green box now because who wrapped a pair of anchor tags around the green box here you guys can see that I had this little hand icon as a mouse cursor which means that I can execute this and it's actually going to behave like a link and take me somewhere else so were to click it you guys can see we now get taken to the font calm and this works with images or videos or anything you insert inside your HTML document in but in between the anchor tag so you can actually turn anything into a link using a pair of anchor tags now the last thing I want to show you guys which is something that we talked about in a previous episode when we talked about classes and ID's is that we can also use anchor tags as bookmarks meaning that if it were to have some content inside my page here that's actually going to just copy-paste the paragraph here many times inside the page this is go ahead and have very little text just gonna couldn't cut the pieces many times over and over and over again so we have a lot of content inside the website further down the page Thanks so I can actually go and create an ID inside my anchor tag here at the bottom so were to say ID is equal to some sort of text like here then go back up to the top here create a different angle tag at the very top I can then link to the ID further down the page by writing the name of the ID so just like inside the CSS file if you want to style an ID we can say has tag followed by the name of the ID which was here we can insert some text that says go down to the link save it go back inside the browser and this was actually inside the index page so let's actually go ahead and go back to index.html and as you guys can see we have a bunch of text inside the website now if I want to go down to the link at the bottom I could just scroll down until I get to it but we can also using the ID link to the ID so I can click the link up here and now it's going to take me back down to the bottom so we can actually get to the part where we have the ID inside the page here which is quite nice if you want to create bookmarks inside your page so I hope this wasn't too complicated for you guys the main thing here that I want to show you is that we create links by wrapping anchor tags around the content that we want to link to somewhere because we're going to use that in the next episode we learn how to create a navigation inside a website so we can actually have a menu at the top of the website so we guys injoyed I'll see you guys next time you
