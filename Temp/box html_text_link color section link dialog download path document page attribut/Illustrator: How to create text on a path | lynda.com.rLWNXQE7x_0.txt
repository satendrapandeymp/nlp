the final step is to create the ornamental borders that is these white ornaments with black drop shadow sets around each and every one of the artboards and believe it or not this is actually text on a path so each one of these ornaments is a character of text it's assigned to a path outline but before I could show you how to make these borders because they're a little bit intricate I'd like to first introduce you to type on a path here inside of Illustrator so I'm going to switch to this document it's called type on path demo day I found inside the Oh a type folder and notice that we have a line of type and then two lines one red one blue each of which are fundamentally identical however the red line goes from left to right and the blue line goes from right to left and you wouldn't know it to look at them but it's going to affect how the type lines to the path now inside of another program we would select the type and the path and then we would join them together by let's say going to the object menu and choosing the path command and then choosing join but that's dimmed currently because you create type on a path directly inside of Illustrator that is you click on the line with the type tool and you start typing away if you want to assign some type that you created in advance you need to cut it and then paste it into place and that's what we'll be doing so click off of the text in order to deselect everything select a text using the black arrow tool for example that's just fine then go up to the object menu and choose the cut command or press control x command X on the Mac that cuts the text to the clipboard now we're ready to assign it to either one of the paths so I'm going to start with the red path because it's a little more predictable by going over here to the type tool now I could click and hold on the type tool and specifically select the type on a path tool don't need to do that though the type tool is going to work just fine for our purposes so whenever you hover the type tool over an open path notice it's cursor is going to change to the type on a path cursor so instead of getting the standard i-beam cursor with a dotted square around it I get an i-beam with a dotted curve flowing through it then I will click on this first point in the path like so and notice that gives me a blinking insertion marker perpendicular to the angle of the path so it's attached to the path outline also notice that the stroke disappeared from the path automatically because illustrator is just assuming that you don't want to stroke anymore you just want to see the text flowing along the curve nothing else then you go up to the Edit menu and you choose the paste command or you press control V command V on the Mac and that goes ahead and paste the text on to the path like so and that's all there is to it now you switch back to your black arrow tool and notice now that you'll see these tall vertical lines right here along the edges of the path outline so right at the beginning of the path and right at the end of the path and these allow you to determine where the text starts and where it ends so if I drag this left hand bar for example notice that I'm moving the text over to the right and if I drag it too far notice the word author is going to fall off the end and then the word and is going to fall off and so on and I'll end up with some overflow text as indicated by this little red cross now that's not what I want so I'll go ahead and press control Z command Z on the Mac to undo that modification you can also by the way change the alignment of your text so if I bring up my paragraph panel I can change the alignment to Center if I so desire I'll go ahead and move my page up a little bit so I can see what I'm doing and notice that I've centered the text along the path outline I can also align it to the right if I so desire and if I want to fill the entire path outline here with my text then I would switch over here to justify all lines an illustrator will automatically space the text accordingly that's one way to work I'm going to go ahead and switch back to the align left option hide the paragraph panel let's see what happens when the path outline is going in an unexpected direction so I'll switch over to the type tool once again and I'll click at the beginning of this blue path the exact same point I'm clicking at the beginning I'm saying to illustrator I want to start it here click at that location you will notice that the blue stroke goes away but you may not notice that the blinking insertion marker is over here this time on the right hand side of the path and upside down that's very easy to miss then I go up to the Edit menu choose the paste command or press control V command V on the Mac and the text comes in upside down what the heck is going on there well illustrator is respecting the direction of the path outline not that you would ever know what that direction is but it happened in this case to go from right to left go figure so what in the world do you do about it well you switch back to your black hero tool which you can do once again by pressing the Escape key and then notice in addition to this end marker right there and the beginning marker you also have this middle marker well when it allows you to do is flip the type so if you drag this mid marker to the other side of the path outline then you flip your type in the opposite direction there's another way to work if you want more control by the way you go up to the type menu you select type on the path and then you choose type on a path options and that brings up this dialog box right there which includes a flip check box so first I'll turn on the preview checkbox so I can see what I'm doing then I'll turn on flip that allows you to flip the text to the other side all right I'll go ahead and turn flip off because I've performed a manual flip I don't need the flip checkbox on also notice that we have a bunch of alignment options notice I can switch the way in which the text is aligned to the path from baseline so in other words currently the baseline of my text is anchored to the path outline I could switch it to a sender so the text is going to drop down so that it's very tippy top most ascenders are touching the path outline according that is to the terms of the font definition is something important to bear in mind there you can also work from the D Center so that's going to send the text way up there or you can switch to Center if you like and that should more or less Center the text between the baseline and the visible a centers you never know though this is all subject to the font definition if you need more control then you can work with baseline shift as we'll see in a future exercise in my case I'm just going to switch this back to baseline you can also switch the effect that is how the text blaze when it is wrapped along the path outline so in other words you can skew the text like so notice how every letter is skewed at a consistent angle in this case which I think looks pretty bad 90% of the time you get to stick with rainbow but you do have other options we've got skew as you can see you've got 3d ribbon whatever and you've got stair-step which gives you this effect right there you can fool around with these and finally you've got gravity I have to say I've never used any of these in an actual project I've always stuck with rainbow but there are these other options available to you and then finally you have the spacing options if you find that your Texas getting bunched up in the concave areas of the path and spread out in the convex areas then you can experiment with these spacing options to see if you can get better results so for example negative 36 is going to end up scrunching the concave areas that much more whereas positive 36 is going to space apart those concave areas and this is a fairly intelligent spacing option so once again it affects the concave areas and the convex areas independently all right so you can experiment with those to your heart's content that's the basics of working with type on a path outline inside of Illustrator in the next exercise I'll show you how to create those ornamental borders
