hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to do something pretty easy we're going to sit a hero what I like to call it background image and we're going to give it a semi-transparent black overlay and we all know what that's good for is it's it's good for putting text over white text you know just to get the attention of the audience it seems to be a recurring theme in web design the hero isn't dead yet so I'll show you guys how to do it so open up your text editor and you're going to want to have an index.html so set this up very bare-bones doctype and then you have your head and inside that I made a title you don't really have to give it a title but you do want to link to your CSS file I'm not going to teach you how to link to your stylesheet you should know that by now I'm not you know for really focusing on you know super beginner stuff so now that I mentioned that let's go to the body and we only need to do a few lines of HTML code here to get the full width that we're looking for so started out with a div id you can make it a class too if you want but I'm sticking to an ID so div id hero so this is going to be our outside box think of it like that and then inside this box we want to do hero overlay and that's going to be the semi transparent mask if you will that's going to lay over the image and then all you have to do is you open it you start it and you close it immediately and so just make sure you close the div here for this so this big container house is it's going to house the background image we're going to put that in the CSS and then inside of it we're putting a essentially a blank box right an empty box but what we're going to do is we're going to give it a background color of black we're going to change the opacity so you can see through it and we're going to give it the height and width that is equal to the outside and so basically it's just laying over it very very basic easy to do so let's get started right away on the CSS you're done with your HTML save it and then start your hero ID in your CSS and just get started on the background image and all you got to do is the Earl you guys should know this syntax by now and whatever just just find out a photo that has like has high resolution online and save it to you know your image folder you should know how directories work I'm not teaching that either so in my image folder you know so this basically what this is doing is saying let's jump back to the main directory where we have our web files and then find the image folder and inside that I have a I have a photo file labeled mountain JPEG you could name it whatever you want whatever type of image you want whatever image you find so mountain dot jpg and then we're going to do two more lines of code and just in regards to the background image and what this does is it spreads the background image you know across the available viewport and it actually makes it look a lot better so we do that and then this positions the actual image and for now we're just going to do Center Center you're not really familiar with background positioning and that stuff check out check it out on w3schools it's very they actually explain it pretty well that's actually where I learned most of the stuff and you know I was started I was able to start doing this within 5 minutes of reading so background position Center Center and then there's going to be a few more things that we need to do so we're sitting the position but that's not for the background image it's for the container so we set some attributes for the background image that sits inside the container you know but for the position of the container we're going to do relative top:0 bottom:0 and then there's a cool little line of code that you can do to do your vertical height and your your with make it 100% and it's with this line right here height 100 VH and you'll see what happens so I have a template already made up just so I don't miss anything so I got everything except for so when I set the z-index for it so we're going to do is the index of negative 10 and what that does is we're going to set a so this is a low value right and then we're going to do a for the hero overlay when we start this next in our CSS we're going to give that a higher one of negative 5 because think of what you're trying to do you want the overlay to be a to make of it like as a stack of cards so you're here overlay card is going to be on top of your hero container card essentially so now that we've got that done let's save and see if the actual image shows up so I had this up before so if i refresh this you should see the overlay go away and then so this is actually good that this happened because apparently the browser is giving it seems like it's giving a an initial margin on the body of the document and I'll show you I'm using Google Chrome so I used to fill up our tools a lot and it works great I'm sure every browser has it but I like Chrome so you can see you see that orange right there all around the document so the bot the body has a default setting and let's check out what it is so the body has a margin of 8 pixels so how do we change that pretty easy so just go in here this may or may not do this to you but it did for me so I want to I'm going to set a margin of zero pixels and that will cover the top right bottom and left and set it all to zero and then so I just saved it refresh and now there you go you have your full yup your full web background but the image is pretty bright in my with the image I'm using so we got to set the overlay now so start your hero overlay ID section and what you gonna do is position:absolute and then what you want to do is background color and we're going to do an RGB a value you don't know much about our GBA look it up definitely comes in handy and so this is where you set your color values and so zero zero zero is black and then the last here I believe it's called alpha I'm not sure I just know how to use it I should probably look that up but so 0.5 means we're changing the opacity of the entire overlay to half of what it is right now by giving it a 0.5 and let's see if I'm missing anything else so yep I am sitting see all these things to we're going to do that as well so I'm going to copy and paste this whole thing actually why I make myself type it so what we did it again is we just set a top:0 bottom:0 to get it to a line and then I tried the VH aligned on the Orlais and it didn't work for me it may work for you but I had to manually set height 100% with 100% and then z-index negative 5 so if you think of a deck of cards here overlay is on top of hero and then it has a opacity to make it semi-transparent so save refresh and boom there you go and then whatever you guys want to do from there be my guess but my job is done I hope you enjoyed the video and you know get a get in touch with me on twitter if you have any questions it's at it's me Danny G alright thanks guys
