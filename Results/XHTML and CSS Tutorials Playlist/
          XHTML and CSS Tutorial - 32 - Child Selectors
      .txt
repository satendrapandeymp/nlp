why hello there but you could say my name is bucket and welcome to your thirty-second XHTML and CSS tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed my British accent I know I did but anyways in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about how to style a child selector now let me give you guys a quick overview of what I mean by child first of all I'm not talking about a child selector like you decided that you and your wife want to adopt a baby so now you have to select a child that's not what I'm talking about not in this tutorial at least maybe I'll do that in the next tutorial one let me just my microphone there that's better so anyways a child in terms of XHTML is a tag that's inside another tag so for example you see how whenever we make tags like body they have to be within the HTML tags or whenever we have the style tags they have to be within the head tags we can't have head style head style they have to be inside one another so the relationship I'm talking about is this see this head the head is a child of HTML so HTML would be the parent and since head is inside it would be the child body is also a child of HTML since body is inside HTML style is a child of head since style is inside head so you can say style is the child head is the parent there now you guys should understand what I mean by a child and a parent now with that being said I'm going to show you guys how to style a child selector for example if you come across this bro I want to style links but I only want to style the ones inside paragraphs well we can't just go ahead and make a style for links because that's going to apply to all of them in order to say alright we want to apply only to the ones that are in paragraphs we need to do something something special so let's go ahead and first and foremost make three different links right here just go ahead and put like a href equals HTTP the New Boston comm and now let's go ahead and just write it like first or something like that so first of all we're just going to have a regular link on the screen let's refresh this make sure it works and when we click it it takes us to the greatest website ever the New Boston comm so anyways let's go ahead and make two more so first and foremost we have a regular link on the screen nothing special so now let's go ahead and make a paragraph PP oh man I crack myself up and now let's go ahead and put this link inside PP and R all right second I am so immature is ridiculous these are the most unprofessional tutorials you have ever seen in your life probably but hey they're pretty good so and last let's go ahead and put another one in the header so now you're saying Ari I have these three links and I want oh yeah God probably do this third so first second third so here's what they look like the first one is just regular plain old text the second one is inside a paragraph and the third one is inside the header so right now they all look the same and you're saying alright I want a style only the links that are inside paragraph tag so I want to style basically only these so in order to do that like I said we can't just go ahead and style all the links or else it's going to style all of them what we need to do is say this all right first of all inside the paragraph tags I want to style all the links now let me you know kind of put this in another terms you're saying are a a it's pretty much all right all children a with the parent of P or basically all link tags inside paragraphs I'm going to go ahead and style those and you use this with the greater than sign so greater than sign pretty much means relationship whenever a make a link has a parent of P aka paragraph I want to style you so now let's go ahead and apply some styles let's go ahead and put color red and maybe but like font size 30 pixels not that it's a lowercase Oh embarrassing so let me go ahead and add this last semicolon refresh and see what we got check it out now CSS went through look for all the links now we're inside the paragraph is this link inside a paragraph nope is this link inside a paragraph yup so I'm going to style this one is this link inside a paragraph no it's inside a header so don't touch that one either and it go ahead or excuse me and it went ahead and applied the style to those links so that is not only how you talk in terms of relationships child parents but also how you can style pretty much not only a link but basically anything you want depending on what it parent what their parent is and another quick bit of information I wanted you guys you guys are probably saying alright if head is the child of HTML then does that mean style is the grandchild of HTML yes it does in technical terms that's how it works so um hTML is the grandparent of style took us um grandchild child parent or grandparent grandchild depending on what you're referencing um you know that has nothing to this tutorial but you know I got a couple extra minutes might as well give you a nice little tidbit of information so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial um thank you guys for watching don't forget to check out my website and I'll see you next video
