hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 13th role in this course in this tutorial we're gonna talk about the famous or the very infamous font tag in HTML and the reason why I say that it is in famous is because you know people don't use the font tag to do anything now you know they just use CSS but anyway this is a very interesting and a very powerful tag and using this you can do a lot of things in in HTML so and it's still supported it's a deputy tag words to support it so anyway let's just get on with this tutorial and see how you can use the font tag to increase the size or increase or decrease the size of text in your documents how you can change the color of text and you know how you can also change the font style right so you can do all this using just the font tag so in this document on line number one I have the doctype declaration on line number two I have the opening HTML tag on line number 12 I have the closing HTML tag so all my tags and text and everything else is between you know line number two and line number 12 and in the head section between the opening and closing title tags I have all about fonts as a title of the webpage in the body section I have four paragraphs actually you know this is the first paragraph and then this is the second paragraph and this is the third paragraph and then on line number ten I have the fourth paragraph right so let me show you guys this file in google chrome before explaining you know the effects that I've tried to accomplish right so this is how the file looks you have the world as the four sentence in the web page then you have is getting as the next sentence and you can make out that this sentence is smaller than the four sentence so obviously you know that font size are different and this one is also orange in color whereas the first sentence is black in color and then you also have another word as another paragraph bigger which is much bigger than the previous two sentences and then you have you know another sentence with the words and better and this one has different foreign style as well so now let's check out the HTML behind the page and see what we have so in the body section on line number seven I have the font tag which is f or nd between the lesson symbol in the greater than symbol and then to set the size of text to four I have used the size attribute of the font element of the font tag right and I've set its value to four so it's very simple you know just as you do with meta tags you have to first get in the name of your tag which is find give a space get the name of the attribute the property or the value of which you want to set and then you use the assignment operator or the equal to symbol and within double quotes you type in the value so you want to set the size the font of for you just type in four here and then I've used the P tank to get the text the world right and you close the font tag just the way you close all the other tags in HTML slash and then font on the next line on line number eight I have the font tag again and this time I've used the color attribute of the font tag to set you know the color of the text to orange so I have used the word orange here as the value of the color attribute and again I have the opening and closing paragraph tag for the text is getting and then on line number nine I have the font I'll again and this time I have set the size to seven and you know between the opening and closing paragraph tags I have the text bigger and on nine number ten I have the you know font again and this time I have changed the size of the font to seven I've changed the size of the text and I've also changed the font style so I've changed it to comic sans ms this is my favorite foreign style and then I have the paragraph tag tags and in between the tags I have the text and better and of course a close my font tag right so this is how the fine looks when you you know run it in Google Chrome and I'm sure it would look similar if you run it in other browsers - I haven't tested this one actually I should have done that but anyway I hope you guys do it and you know that's it for this tutorial and you may subscribe to my channel if you have already and I'm gonna see you in the next one in which we will discuss more HTML tags and more features and I said take care
