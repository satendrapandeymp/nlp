hello everyone my name is lolly pesky and welcome to the html5 tutorial and in this video I'm going to talk about the older HTML 4 or X HTML elements which are now depreciated or removed in html5 so depreciated or removed that doesn't mean that you know they are not supported in the browser they're still running on browsers because people still using these elements and when people stop using these elements then browser will automatically stop implementing them inside the new version of their browsers so some of the depreciated elements of HTML and XHTML are for example we have strong tag to make the text strong or bold this is strong close the strong tag we have e m tag to make the text emphasize or you can see a little italic this is italic we have the big tag to me to make the text little big close the big tag and we have small tag this is small closed or small tag like this control save it and when you preview in the browser as you can see de appears as it is that means they are still working let me just have a little br tag okay so this is strong this is italic this is big in this is small that means that browsers are still supporting these elements and what's the reason of that the reason is people's are still using and implementing these you know these elements inside their websites today and when people stop using these elements then browser will automatically stop implementing them inside the new version of their browsers that I've said so these are some of the depreciated elements there are many more so that's it for this video in this video I've shown you guys little depreciated elements that are depreciated inside the new html5 specifications or documents so that's it for this video thanks for watching and if you liked the video don't forget to subscribe and in the next video I'm going to talk about the other new elements of html5 so thanks for watching
