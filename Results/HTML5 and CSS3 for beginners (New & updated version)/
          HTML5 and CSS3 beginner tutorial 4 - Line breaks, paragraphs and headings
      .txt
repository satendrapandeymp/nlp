hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number four and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about line breaks paragraph tags and headings so I'm starting off with the code from the previous tutorials and as you can see right now I've got this one line of text that says hooray I just made my first webstie and in the browser that's also displaying so let me go ahead and zoom in on this because I want this to be clear for the tutorial and for now let's take a look at how to jump over to a new line because right now you might think okay well I want my text to display on a new line let me go ahead and hit enter and I'll type in the second sentence like this is the second line or something like that go ahead and save go back to the browser refresh okay that was weird I went through the effort of typing all of this on two lines but for some reason in the browser it's still displaying on one line well that is because HTML is whitespace insensitive that means it doesn't matter how much space you put in between these two lines whenever the browser is rendering or displaying the page it's just going to get rid of all the space and treat it as if you had just pushed spacebar which basically is what happened here as well we've got the first line and then we've got you know as if you had just hit a space or space bar and then we've got what should be the second line so if we want to actually create a line break we need to use something or if you want to go in a new line we need to use something called a line break tag which is the smaller than and greater than symbols with a be R in the middle so that is a break tag and a line break is a single tag so usually what I do is I it off with a closing slash just to tell myself that this is a single tag it is also strict HTML standards that we used to follow we used to have to end every single tag off with a closing slash and so that means that this major tag up here should also end off with a closing slash but in HTML 5 standards are not so strict anymore so we don't need the closing slash there but it's still like I like to have it personally it just tells me that this is a single tag and I'm not looking for a closing tag further down the page right so now that that's kind of information is over let me go ahead and save and let's take a look at what this will look like in the browser so let's come back here and hit refresh and now you can see that I've got my first line and then in the place where I put my break tag we now jump down to a new line and this is the second line so that is how to create a new line in HTML and you might be wondering ok well if that's how I create a new line how do I create paragraphs well let me show you guys how to do that so we'll create our first paragraph by opening up a P tag so let me hit enter and that's going to autocomplete that for me and whatever text you display or type in this paragraph that will become our paragraph so let's say this is our first paragraph and I think I'll just copy this and create a second paragraph as well so second paragraph further down the page and we don't have to worry about typos so let me go ahead and save this and take a look at what this will look like in the browser so let's hit refresh and now you can see we've got our first paragraph and then we've got a paragraph spacing and then we have our second paragraph so that's how we create paragraphs and the only reason why I type this like this in my code is for it to be readable so it would still work if I basically kept my paragraph all you know condensed like this but that can be kind of difficult to read when you have a lot of information in the paragraph I mean how do I know where this paragraph ends right so what I like to do is just have the starting tag and the ending tag in line with each other and that way I know this paragraph starts here and ends here and then I indent all text that belongs to the paragraph it's just there for readability so let me go ahead and well we've already looked at this in the browser so let me just save and move on to the next topic which is headings so in HTML we have six different types of headings and usually they are bolded and they're a little bit bigger than normal text so let me show you guys how to create headings on your web page and to do that I'm just going to remove all of this text and start off with a new tag which is h1 and if I had entered that will complete the tag for me so h1 stands for heading 1 and this is our biggest heading right then like I said we have a bunch of different headings in HTML so we've got from h1 all the way down to h6 so if I copy this and just paste this a couple times that looks like six all you need to do is change the numbers so from H 1 to H 2 H 3 4 5 & 6 just make sure that you close all of them otherwise you're going to land up with some weird display issues and obviously H 2 is not the biggest heading it is now the second biggest heading H 3 is the third biggest heading and so on and so forth so let me go ahead and save this and come back over to the browser and hit refresh and right now you can see that there look absolutely massive but let's just look at that at normal size quickly and as you can see this is what an h1 should display like in your browser so as you well yeah you can tell h1 is the biggest heading h6 actually seems smaller than normal text even so this is kind of weird but I don't think we really have to worry about h6 or h5 unless you have a website that has like a million different subsections we don't go this far down the page most websites make use of the first three quite often these last three are not used all that often it depends on how many subsections you have on your site or on your specific page so now that we've taken a look at headings that is the end of the tutorial so I'll see you in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards
