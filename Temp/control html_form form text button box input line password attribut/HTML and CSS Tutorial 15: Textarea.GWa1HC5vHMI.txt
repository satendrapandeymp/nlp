what's going on guys and welcome to your 15th HTML and CSS tutorial so in this tutorial we'll be learning about text area in HTML and in the last tutorial we learned about input type basically input boxes in HTML in this tutorial let's see what our text areas are how we can create one so here's our browser and let's create a text area just like it sounds it is a tag a closing tag instead of just a empty tag like input and it is pretty much like it would create a like this thing right here which you could basically modify it size with your mouse itself so this creates this thing because of the enter I entered here so if I do like this thing then it would be clean as you can see now if I type anything like here hello world then it will appear inside this text box so we don't have any value attribute for this to specify because this is a container tag instead of empty tag so basically text areas are used for writing long messages which could not be returned into one line input type boxes so these are kind of multi-line messages for your form for example if you want some suggestions or comments from your users then instead of using one line input box you would use prefer to use text areas and we have a bunch of attributes for this text area and let's discuss what they are so let's have a look we have calls and rows attributes in text areas and many more but these are two kind of required I guess and you get you can see like 50 calls 20 rows just to show you what does these two mean let's reload this and as you can see we have successfully modified the text area size now what does this mean actually that there would be 20 lines down here and to be more precise let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and exactly 20 lines as rows and 50 calls means that there would be 50 characters in the slide let's see 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 100 rather than a tonight daddy daddy was a 30-30 wanted better success than 38 the night body 41 what - 41 over the Bible - voiceover the f1 950 Wow we just counted for one 250 and you were fast in your class a so now as you can know now as you know now that called stands for the number of characters in one row andrew stands for a number of lines in your text box so you can modify the size of text area with calls and rows articles but I would recommend going with CSS which would be learning in future tutorials to modify the size of this text box and basically we have and another attribute which would allow you to limit the number of characters entered in your text box and let's see what that attribute is now in your attribute and your were element type max length and set it to 10 and now let's reload this let's just remove this let's reload this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and whoa I cannot type any further in this text box because we have set max length to ten it would block any further input in the text box so you can remove your input but it will not be able to add input beyond ten characters in my case and you can modify this value 200 or whatever you like so that's all about text area in forms and that's how they work and they are pretty much flexible for a messaging and all that stuff you need when you need to write some long messages and so I'll see you then in the next tutorial and we'll be discussing something cool about forms in the next tutorial and share that and I'm going for dinner so see you then good bye and take care and don't forget to subscribe obviously
