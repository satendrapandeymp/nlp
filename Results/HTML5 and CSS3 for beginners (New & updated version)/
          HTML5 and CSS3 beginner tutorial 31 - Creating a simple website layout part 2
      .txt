hey YouTube how's it going is Quintin here and welcome to tutorial number 31 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to make your website look a little bit more website so yeah you can see that I'm working with the navigation that we had in the previous tutorial unfortunately I've added a little bit of space here by mistake so I'm going to have to try and get rid of that something I actually just noticed now and then if we take a look at the content of the site I've gone ahead and created an image that takes up like the full width of our container and then a an article so this is just a bunch of lorem ipsum which is silicon test to make the website look like it has text even though I don't know exactly what I'd like to write here just yet so it's great to like see what a website will look like with content but you don't want to sit and write all the content yourself you're probably going to wait for whoever you're selling the website to to give you content right so yeah that is what we're going to be taking a look at in this tutorial so let's jump over to my text editor and we're going to have to add the second part code here so I'm just going to add a comment so that we know where the code for the second part of this tutorial starts and that's the CSS code right I'm just going to create a little bit of space yeah and then for our index file I'm going to change this up a little bit so we've got the same header obviously as the previous tutorial what I'd like to do is take this article out and place the article below this section right and in fact what I want to do is now indent all of this stuff so command and curly brace to just indent all of that and then I'm going to create another div over here I'm going to give this div the same class of tea and container all right and so that's just going to be a container or a wrapper for our site too answer it and give it a max width of 1200 pixels so that's the nice thing about classes is that they are reusable so something like that container class we can just place wherever we need a container right so let me let me go back here and just take this aside the article and the section and place them all within the container right so I'm going to save that now and of course nothing is going to just nothing's going to show up yet so what I'd like to do is add an image to our section so let's go ahead and say image source is equal to alt is equal to something as well and I'm going to grab this image so let's open up finder look at images and I've got this image called Strasberg River so this is a picture of me in strasbourg suppose i don't need to open it just yet we'll take a look at that in the browsers let me go ahead and paste the URL make sure that we are going to the images folder first and then to the river image so let's come back here and refresh okay so now all the rest of the content disappears but we have our image displaying in the top section over here there's no space between the image and the heading and I probably want to add some spacing in here but other than that I also want to add in the article content right so let's come back here and go to the article and generally an article will always start off with an h1 the reason why is because when Google ranks your website it's going to look at two things to give you a ranking one of those is going to be this title it's going to look at a bunch of other things but important stuff is going to be this page title and also what is in your heading 1 so you don't want to have like three hitting ones and confuse Google you just want to have one heading one for the article and so let's just say this is a really interesting story about fraud because I was in Strasbourg alright pretty cool photo actually with the tram in the background of the skyline is a very good day I remember this day I like out of my head and it happened last year still so pretty good day well yeah where else you remember a day from out of your hits but I mean like I remember it so well I remember it like it was yesterday anyway yeah so we got our h1 and let me go ahead and add in a paragraph over here and for this paragraph I'm just kind of tight and lorem hits tab and that's going to generate something called lorem ipsum which is filler content right so I'm just going to remove that little + symbol and yeah let's copy and paste this paragraph a few times so something that I said oh yeah is really want one h1 so if you're going to have a second heading on your page that's going to be an h2 you can't always file the h2 with another class to make it look like an h1 but you don't really want to use two h1 most of the time ok and then let's paste that paragraph below here let's just say this is a subheading and I think I'm going to copy and paste the start of this h2 and we'll say this is a list and just add a list below here so I or well ul and then Li come on quinton k UL li and I think I'm going to just place three list items so let's get them ready so long and just copy paste some text under some pieces of this paragraph I guess right so now we've got our list and then at the bottom of this list obviously we'll just add in like a conclusion or something so you'll usually conclude your story with a little bit of a paragraph and then right at the bottom you might want to put your author name so I'm going to add in a paragraph and then add a small tag and what a small tag does is just make all text within it smaller so it'll be like half the size of the normal paragraph and we'll just say written by Quinton what or something like that and you can also link the article or the Linksys title to like a page about you right so let's save that now come back to the page and refresh and now we have all of our content displaying on the side as well but it doesn't quite look very nice everything's kind of bunched up against each other there's no spacing between the headings in the paragraph there's no spacing between the paragraphs and the other headings no spacing between image and that is because when we were yesterday or yeah it was yesterday for me but I don't know when maybe only 10 20 minutes ago for you guys we styled our style sheet with this rule which took away all margins and padding's on all elements by default so we're going to need to throw in a bunch of margins and padding's and spacing for some of our elements so what I want to do is for our paragraphs I want to add a margin bottom of 20 pixels just so that all paragraphs have 20 pixels below them then for any heading like h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 so that's how you style multiple elements at the same time you just add a comma between each one of them and they will all get the same styling and I think I'm just going to add a margin bottom on these of 20 fix 10 let's go 15 no 10 right and the reason why is because I still want the headings to appear close enough to the paragraphs that they you know that this hitting goes with that paragraph imitating goes of that paragraph but there's 20 pixels of spacing on the this paragraph in this heading to kind of just separate that a little bit more alright something else that we can notice is that our ordered list the bullet points are appearing on the outside of the containers like it's not aligned with anything so I think an ordered list and in fact ordered lists will have the same sort of styling we just need to add a margin to the left of 20 pixels and then a margin bottom of also 20 pixels right and that now lines them up a little bit and also gives it a little bit of space on the bottom right so this is starting to look a little bit more like a website I just want to add a white background and maybe some space above yeah and also you can see this styling rules the unordered list and ordered list filing rule has unfortunately added a little bit of space to our navigation so I might want to just shoot up to TM now and grab that unordered list item so I just just the unordered list not the list items and just gives us a margin bottom all zero pixels now hopefully that removes that extra space all right so that's gone and then in our content I'd actually like a margin on top of this and a margin below this container so let's add in an extra class here of p.m. content save this now and just go down to the bottom of the CSS you can add TM content and I just want to add a margin top of 30 pixels and a margin bottom of 30 pixels and doing it this way means that hopefully I don't overwrite the left and right margin so it should still be centered if you use a shortcut you'll probably find that your article gets unscented but doing it this way with the two styling rules should add space on the top and the bottom without throwing our content of the center all right so now we've got our image over here all set up and I wonder if it's stretching out of the container we'll have to see so what I'd like to do as well and I could do this with TM content but I think I'm actually going to do it for each section so I'm going to give this section a class of TM top a so that's like our main section or the top section of our site and we'll probably come up with a styling rule for that in the next thing I want to do is give the article a cloth of TM - article and I'm going to definitely style this with it's come back yet I'll say this and come back over CSS and select TM article and also T p.m. not let's not liftoff and let's not select members at the same time so TM article and I want to give this a background of whites of that background FFF and a padding of 30 pixels all the way around so 30 pixels and that should just generate a little bit of spacing for us great so you can see that now there's spacing between the text with Texas and we're the white pod end if you didn't add the padding obviously that spacing wouldn't be there had probably look a little bit weird but yeah this is starting to look a lot more like an article heading ahead an image actually looks pretty good the way it is but right now you can see that there is a little bit of spacing underneath this image it's really really small actually I'm not even sure if you're going to be able to see it but if i zoom in you can definitely see a bit of a gray line over here so I want to get rid of that so to do that I'm going to add in another styling little kind of a default one for all images on my site and I want to either display them block or inline block and that will just get rid of the spacing underneath if I want an image to display inline again I can always add in another cloth but yeah now that that tiny little line of white space that's gone all right something else I also wanted to do with my images is give it a max width of 100 percent and the reason why I'm doing that is because sometimes an image can be a little bit too big for its container I'm not sure if this will happen yeah okay you can see right now as I make the browser Smola everything else tends to get smaller but the image doesn't it doesn't resize but if I add max with 100 percent save this and then come back to the browser and hit refresh which something I didn't do before I showed you this now we can scale the browser and the image actually gets smaller to fit the size of the content or the space that it has right so that makes all images responsive basically that little line of code alright so now we have all of that styled and I'd say that's pretty much all I have for you guys in this video in the next video we'll take a look at maybe adding a bottom section and a footer or something like that but yeah you've got a pretty good idea of how to go about creating a website layout for a page layout and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll
