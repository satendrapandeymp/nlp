in this video we're going to take a look at the fixed layout now in all the previous videos in the CSS layout series we designed a flexible or liquid web page and let's open that up right now and you can see it expands out nicely and takes up all the space in the browser window now let me open up the fixed layout now I've already coated this so we're not going to spend a lot of time filling in the content panels like we did in the liquid layout that's pretty much the same but what I want to do is talk about the main differences between a fixed layout and a flexible layout so let's go ahead and open up the fixed layout now and you can see that is the first major difference that it doesn't expand out to the entire length of the browser window you can see we've got some white space and that's because I have fixed this at 968 pixels in terms of the width it cannot go any farther than that and so if we toggle back to the flexible layout you can see that we cover the entire length of the browser window so that's the first major difference now how do we do this we create what's called a container div and that's the first and biggest difference between a fixed and a liquid layout we are actually creating a container to hold all the rest of our divs so the header the nav the main content the sidebar they are all put inside one div which is appropriately called a container div and I like that named container because that's what a container does we put things into it and it cannot expand outside of it so it acts like a box a container it's even called a wrapper some people call it that and so let's take a look at the code now and you can see we have the same sections that we did in the flexible layout we have the header the nav the sidebar we have the main section but what's different is the container CSS code and that's what I created right here so this of course is a stylesheet let's take a look at the HTML now here is the container right here the div and here is the closing div tag for that container and you can see all the rest of the divs are contained inside of it so that's the first thing you have to do when you want to create a fixed layout you want to create a container div and then wrap all the rest of the divs inside the container div which again closes down here now if we take a look at the CSS code for the container here's where I set the width nine hundred and sixty eight pixels so like I said before it it cannot expand out any further than that nine hundred and sixty eight pixels so if we flip back to the fixed layout from this edge to this edge over here it is nine hundred and sixty eight pixels long it will not go any further so it won't go out to maybe twelve hundred pixels I have basically indicated that all the sections have to be contained within nine hundred and sixty eight pixels so that's the first thing you would set is a maximum width now we will set the margin to zero pixels and also use this value called Auto and what that does is Center the entire webpage and so let's flip back here and you can see here it's centered on the webpage and if I didn't have that set correctly it would place the webpage over here to the left and I'll show you that right now actually so let's go ahead and just remove this and we will save our stylesheet let's go back into the web page and we will hit refresh and you can see now the web page is now rendering from the left side of the browser and that's because I'm not centering the container anymore so let's put that back and save this and if we hit refresh everything is centered back nice and neat okay that's going to do it for this video in the next video we will continue on with a fixed layout oh one more thing as usual I will paste all the source into the YouTube message board for this fixed layout
