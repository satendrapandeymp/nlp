in this video of HTML we are going to discuss about the marquee tag for a beginner this marketer can be a bit it attractive as it will give you the moving text or image so basically whatever you will put inside the marquee tag you can see that crawling or sliding across your browser window so let's see a practical implementation of this mock attack so for the moving text what I will do I will use the marquee tag and whatever I will put inside this market tag will start moving so let's save it and here in the browser you can see that I have this moving text by default this moving text is coming from right to left in your window but using some attributes you can actually make some changes out here for example if I change the direction to right alright so now you can see it start coming from right similarly we do have some more options like that's down all right so it is coming down from top if I say Direction up it will start moving in the upward direction alright as you can't see much things about here so for increasing the height I will use the height attribute and I will make it around 40% of the complete window size so here you can see it this one is moving in the upward direction now we do have the concept called behavior associated with the maquis so as far as behavior is concerned I have three values that is scroll slide and alternate by default the scroll attribute is set for this value for this attribute but if you want you can make some changes as well like slide all right so when I will use slide option it will just come and stop as soon as it reaches the destination all right see if I'll use alternate it will keep on coming from top to down and from down to top in the alternate manner you can also do the nesting of market acts in order to do some customizations out there so for that what I will do is I will just use one more at market tag here with the direction right all right and I'll keep the behavior as alternate only and I'll close a couple of market tags as I opened two I have I have to close two as well so here when I will start doing that so you can see both direction top and right are working simultaneously as far as the alternate behavior is also working with both of these market acts alright so this is how you can start working with the moving text in HTML
