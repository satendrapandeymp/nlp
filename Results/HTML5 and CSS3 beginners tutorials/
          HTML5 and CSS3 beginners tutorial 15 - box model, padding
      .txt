hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 15 and in this tutorial we are going to talk about the box model in HTML and CSS but the box model actually consists of four different parts so in this video we are going to be specifically focusing on the padding but let's go ahead and just make a header real quickly and we'll get started and I'll show you guys everything that we need to know so I'm going to start off with heading 1 and ending heading 1 and in here we'll just type something like I'm a box okay so now we can go ahead and save that and I'm just going to make sure that I run this in Firefox and as you can see we've just got a plain old header printed out on our screen so there's nothing special about this but what if I told you that this header and that every single other element that you ever put in the body of your web page is actually a box well if you guys don't believe me let me go ahead and show you real quick okay so let's go to our CSS folder over here and I'm going to select that heading 1 and then what I'm going to do is give it a background color so background color of yellow and that way it'll look like it was kind of highlighted so now when we click refresh you can start to see that we actually do indeed have a box on our web page ok so right now we've only filled in the background color of this box but there are four different parts to this box ok so the first part is the content which is the writing that is inside this box in this case just being I'm a box ok then there is a second part called the padding and the padding is the space around the outside of our but still inside of this yellow background okay so the padding would be how much space but we have between where this yellow starts here and we are words actually start further up okay then we've got the border and the border is basically a decorative pattern that we can put all the way around our element but you can't see it right now because we haven't actually set one with CSS so we're going to have to learn how to do that in the next video okay and then there is something called the margin and the margin goes outside the border and it is basically the amount of white space that you have around the outside of your box okay so in other words the space between the side of my browser here and where this yellow box starts that would be the margin okay so let's go back to our notepad over here and let's just play around with the padding a little bit more seeing as this tutorial is about padding and all we need to do to access the padding property is obviously just type the word padding so as easy as that okay and now we can set this equal to a value of like 50 px which stands for 50 pixels and this should mean we should now have 50 pixels of space inside of our header okay so when I go back and click refresh you can see we now have a really big gap on the top and on the left on a bottom and that space would actually appear on the right as well if we had enough content so I think what I'll do is just go back here and we can copy that and just paste it a couple times just to make sure that that actually goes over two lines okay and as you can see we've got the 50 pixels of space on this side as well but we might not always want to have 50 pixels all the way around we might want the top and the left to be different so we might want the top and the bottom to be the same and we might want the left and the right to be the same but they'll be different from each other okay so let's say I wanted the top to have something like 10 pixels okay then I would go padding - top okay and if I wanted the bottom to have 10 pixels then I could say padding - bottom and I meant to say - bottom 10 pixels and then we can go ahead and just go padding left and I've made this mistake every single time now okay padding left and we could set that equal to some 20 pixels so we'd have more space on the left then on the right I think let's just make that like 60 pixels so we can see the difference and padding on the right we could set that equal to like 60 pixels as well so let's go ahead and save that click fresh and now you can see we actually have 10 pixels on the top 10 pixels a space on the bottom 60 pixels on the left and 60 pixels of space on the right okay but it might get a little bit tedious writing your CSS this way so there is another way to do this a little bit of a shortcut okay and we can just type in the word padding and now we can give it four different values starting with the value for the top so we can say that the top needs to be 10 pixels then it goes top right bottom left okay so now we're working with the right which we can say needs to be 80 pixels or something then we're working with the left top right bottom left okay so we're working with the bottom let's just set that equal to zero pixels and then the left we can set equal to 30 pixels and so now we basically have all the measurements different on each side and let's just add in a comment over here so it goes top right bottom left that is how you add in your padding when you're working with a shortcut like this okay and now you can see we've actually got zero pixels of space on the bottom you can't really see it that well but there are actually zero pixels the only reason why there's a bit of space here is because this line in the paragraph actually has a bit of line height as well okay but then we've got let's see what our measurements were again 1080 0 30 okay so 10 pixels based on the bottom the top 80 pixels on the right zero on the bottom and then the last value was 30 so 30 pixels on the left and wait that's not all okay because there is actually one more shortcut that I want to show you guys and that is being if you wanted the top and the bottom to be the same and then you wanted the left and the right to be the same you could also do it this way so you can also go ahead and say 10 pixels and then 40 pixels and this basically means top and bottom will be 10 pixels and left and right will be 40 pixels so when we go ahead and save this now we should get top and bottom 10 pixels and then left and right have a space of 40 pixels on each side as well okay so thanks for watching guys don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share the video it's really going to help my channel grow and I'll see you guys in the next one
