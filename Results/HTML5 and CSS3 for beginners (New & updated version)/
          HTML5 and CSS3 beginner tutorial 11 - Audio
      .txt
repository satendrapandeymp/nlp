hey YouTube it's Quinn's in here and welcome to tutorial number 11 and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to use the new audio tag in html5 now this works in a very similar way to the video tag which I talked about in the previous video so a lot of the stuff is the same except now instead of playing a video we're actually playing audio so I've got my index file over here and I've also got a audio track which is an mp3 file make sure that you're using an mp3 because well not there aren't really any other audio types that are supported by this tag so mp3 is the safest option if you're using something else it's probably not going to work and now that you've got your mp3 sorted let's take a look at how to add that to our browser so right now I'm starting off with an empty body my website is blank at the moment and I'm gonna open up a new one of these audio tags so let's type audio and then I've got my ending audio tag so that is how to well add the tag but just like I talked about in the previous video with the video tag this may not be supported by some people's browsers hopefully by now it is supported by pretty much everyone's browser but you know if there is that like lazy person who's using a ten year old computer and never bothered to update it and never bothered to switch over to a new browser and they're still using Internet Explorer for some reason this audio tag will not work for them so you just want to put in a little error message over here if if you can see this update your browser now hopefully if you save this and come back over to the browser and hit refresh you don't see a message that's good right because if you do see this text appearing is you've got a really really old out-of-date browser and you need to update your browser okay now that that message is there let's move on to adding a source tag so let me go ahead and type source and just like the previous video this allows us to set a source or to set which file we actually want to use in the the browser so as you can see I've got my mp3 in the same folder as my index file so I'm just gonna copy and paste that name if you wanted to folder your tracks away you could do that just make sure you understand how file paths work I do have a video explaining that already okay and I'm just gonna go ahead and pop the file name into the source and then and it or in the type attribute I'm also going to specify that it is a type of audio slash MPEG and that should mean well that base but basically tells the browser that we are using an mp3 there is only one other file type which is supported and that is an OGG but again the OGG is only supported by some browsers and not by others so to be safe the safest file type is actually an mp3 so just use an mp3 like don't even bother trying to use a different file type okay so now that we have our source set if I pop back up to the browser and refresh I'm probably not gonna see anything because I need to add one more attribute in the top here and that is controls now controls doesn't have to be equal to anything so I can just remove the equal sign and the quotation marks let's save this now and come back over to the browser hit refresh and now I have my audio tag showing up some people like to complain about it not showing up but if you don't have this controls attribute here it's not gonna work right but let me go ahead and hit play I was kind of loud but that is an audio track that I downloaded from the YouTube audio library if you guys are interested and yeah it sounds very arcade gaming like so yeah that is how to add an audio file to your website there are actually a few other attributes that we can add to this audio tag one of them would be autoplay and what that does is automatically play the file as soon as the webpage loads so if i refresh us now the file is playing as soon as the browser loads there is also a loop attribute and what that does is loop the song so if I go back over to the browser now because I have autoplay and loop set it will automatically play and if we get to the end of the track it should loop around and play again just give it a few seconds one or two gether there we go great so the looping works there are also a bunch of other attributes that we could use here like muted but that almost seems pointless like why would you mute an audio track so muted and what this does is by default mute the audio track and tell somebody hits unmute so let's refresh and right now yeah like it is muted I can unmute it and then meet it again but it's all play it's it's still playing because of the autoplay and well just because the autoplay attribute so this is is they're actually for JavaScript purposes later on if you want to be to mute and unmute the track although right now you know it does seem kind of pointless to load the audio file muted and something annoying that you could do is take away that muted attribute take away this controls attribute have the audio on autoplay and loop and refresh and now the track is playing in the background I can't stop it from playing because there's no controls and yeah if you just wanted some background music on your site you could do this it's just probably going to be somewhat annoying because users wouldn't be able to let me mute that users wouldn't be able to mute the soundtrack and they probably just like leave your site especially if you're sitting like I work in an open plan office environment and I sometimes open up websites that have an audio track playing that I can't stop and I usually have to like just leave the website because I mean you can't stop the music or I hit that little mute button in the top corner there but that wasn't always available so just be careful you know and I chase people away from your website when you use this and that is all I have for you in this video so I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks
