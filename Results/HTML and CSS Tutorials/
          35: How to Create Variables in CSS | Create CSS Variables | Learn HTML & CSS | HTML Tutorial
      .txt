how's it going everyone welcome back to a next episode and how to create HTML and CSS now in this lesson I'm going to teach you about something called CSS variable which is something that's relatively new when it comes to CSS styling now a variable is something that we use inside many of the programming languages such as JavaScript and PHP just to mention a few and it's something that helps make creating websites a lot easier especially now when it comes to CSS styling so what I'm going to do is I'm going to explain what exactly a variable is and then I'm going to show you how we can create it inside our CSS styling now a variable is a type of container that we can assign a value to so let's pretend for a second and I have a huge website and inside this website I have a specific color that I use for all the text that I have inside the website let's say for a second then after creating the website I want to change the color into something slightly darker or slightly brighter then instead of having to go inside the style seed and change the styling in thousands of different places by going all the way down the start in changing it one by one I can just go ahead and refer to that variable in some anti styling when I create the styling and then later on just change the value inside the one variable we have at the top of the stylesheet and then all the colors change inside the styling when I do that in one place which is such a great feature to have when it comes to CSS styling now if you still don't quite get what I talk about when I talk about variables then I'll show in just a second so what I have here in front of me is a index page and a style sheet and inside my index page I have a tip box called section 1 an inside section 1 I have a h2 paragraph I have a paragraph and I have a tip box with another paragraph inside of it now what I have here at the bottom is another tip box called section 2 an inside section to adjust have an h2 tag and a paragraph so what I want to do is I want to say well I'm going to be using a specific color throughout this entire website for my text so what I can do instead of having to write the color repeatedly inside all the style except inside my style sheet is that go into my stylesheet I'm just gonna cut in comment this up because you don't actually need this yet and inside the stylesheet I can go and create a pseudo element which you haven't talked about yet but I will in in the next episode if you can create something called a pseudo element which means to refer to a specific thing inside at the website so what I can do is I can say we have a pseudo element called root now the root pseudo element refers to the highest element inside our website which means that any kind of styling that I might apply to the root pseudo element applies to everything inside the website just to explain that in another way forward to go inside the index page the highest element of having inside this specific website or at least in Santa's document here is going to be the HTML tag because it's wrapped around everything else inside the website now the root element is one level higher than the HTML tag it is something that applies to everything inside the website just to explain it in a simple way so the reason I'm trying to style the rudiment inside this style sheet here is because when we create a variable we can only access the variable from any kind of child elements we have inside the style sheet so any kind of element that is the child of whatever I'm trying to apply the variable to here can access it so we need to go up in the highest level of element inside the website and then create the variable so you can access it from everything inside the style sheet is that make sense so inside the root element I can trade a variable so I'm going to say we want to define a variable by saying - - and then I need to give it some kind of name and you can define any kind of name that you want to in this example here I want to use something for creating color for text so what I can do is I can say text - color which is a name that we can apply you can also use dashes inside the name just make sure that the starts with two dashes because that's the name of the variable okay then afterwards we can say : and just like with any kind of CSS styling we can then give it some kind of value so I could say hash tag let's say CCC which is some kind of gray color and right now I just created a variable that I can X from any kind of element inside the stylesheet so if I were to go down here and say that I want to go inside my let's go inside the index pace and just see what we have here if I want to go inside section one and apply the styling to any kind of paragraph than inside section one I can go ahead and go inside my stylesheet and say class section one section has one space P which means two paragraphs inside section one and then apply some kind of styling to it I can go ahead and say I want the color to be some kind of value usually we would set it to hashtag CCC and then we would have a color for the text inside this specific styling path have just created up here but what I can do instead now is think it just referred to the variable creator up here mean that I can just go and copy the name of it copy instead of setting the value to the actual value I can then say Val which stands for variable parenthesis and then inside the parenthesis I can just paste in the name of the variable so right now color is still going to have the specific value up here but we're doing it by referring to the variable we created up here so forward to create I don't know section two down here so we say section two and then we want to start the paragraphs inside section two again I just need to refer to the variable up here and then later on if we want to change the color I just need to go inside the variable and change it to something else and then it changes inside other stylings we have below it here so this is a great way of doing styling when you have one specific value that needs to be repeated in the entire website so this is how we can do this specific thing another thing we can do and by the way if you want to create more than one variable you just go ahead and do that in here as well just create another name for it set a value for it we can also do it for borders well let's say a tip box if you want to we can say we can set it to solids one pixel and create a color for it and then we just go and refer to this variable when we want to create a border for any kind of element inside the website you get the idea here right so what I can do now is I can also go and show another example of using variables because when it comes to see it says if I were to go inside my section one here and just delete the value in here and well a basic type example down here but I'm just going to ignore those for now if I were to go inside section one here and create a variable then the same thing goes any kind of child elements or this specific element that I'm applying the styling to or the variable to can use this variable so were to create a variable here that I can say back ground actually know let's say text size text - sighs then I can just go ahead and create a value for it so I can say it's going to be 14 pixels then what I can do is if we were to refer to section one and then the paragraph in here then I can just go ahead and access the variable as well because the paragraph is a child element of section one so I can just go ahead and say we want to set the font - sighs - the variable we have up here called text size like so and then the same thing happens now what we can't do is I can't go inside the styling for section two section - two paragraph and then refer to this variable up here just like we did down here because remember if I were to go inside the index page section two is not a child element of section one because then it had to be like this inside section one because now - chalant and now it would actually work so it's very important that you understand that we can only do two child elements inside our index page or inside any kind of HTML page we have inside the website so this is how we can apply a variable to CSS styling and it's something that again is very useful to do inside and I really recommend that you use it for your website when you create websites inside HTML or PHP or any kind of program names you might create it in as long as you have a style sheet apply it to it so this is something I recommend using now I hope this was something that made sense to you and I hope this is something you'll use in the future so thank you for watching I'll see you next time [Music]
