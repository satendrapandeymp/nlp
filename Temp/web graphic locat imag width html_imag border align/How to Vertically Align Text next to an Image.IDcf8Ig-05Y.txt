hi guys today we will vertical align text next to an image so let's do it first of all let's import our image image okay I prepare some image in description you have project files are in the description so you can download it and it's a pretty big image but don't worry it's a just a motherboard okay just let style this image a bit we style this image just say that our image size height height to be 100 pixels okay we just shrink our image okay and just add the span element span element and say this is per text okay as you can see this is a text is a bit down here and we want to be in the middle just add vertical-align:middle cut up and this is it guys I don't go there use few gems about this as you can see this is in in the middle and as you can see this blue is our inline element but for example what if we want to add our P tag this is a problem problem problem problem is here okay we got a problem this P is below the image so if we want to add this P next to our image we just have to do this our P tag needs some modification okay we add display display in line tada and this is it as you can see if we select this tag our P tag acts like an inline element just like our span element and because the P tag is a block element if you remove this if we move this it will go down there okay just remove this but if you say inline block it is off all also it will be up but it will act as a block element as you can see I can now select only the text and if I select this it's a different remember this one here the big one is an inline and this one is a block element it's a huge difference and in my tutorial tutorials you can learn what is the difference between inline and block elements so don't be scared and visit me there and that's it guys and have a nice day I hope this I hope this helped you and bye bye
