well hello internet and welcome to my tutorial on how to set up visual studio code for C++ as well as Arduino on Mac OS you guys have asked me for this tutorial and so I shall make it as soon as I work out the bugs on how to set everything up for Windows I will do that but first I'm gonna cover Mac OS and I have a lot to do so let's get into it okay so I'm gonna be moving pretty quickly here so prepare yourself to hit the pause button very first thing you're gonna want to do is go command and space and then you're gonna type in terminal and we're gonna set up G plus plus what you need to do in the terminal is just type in G plus plus if you get the error message that you see right here that means it's already installed in that situation you can go G + + - - version like this and you should see someone and something either four point eight point four or something higher than that if you don't see that what you're going to do is you want to go to the App Store and you're going to download Xcode update here but you're gonna have install so click on install and install Xcode after you do that you're going to open up your terminal again and you're gonna type in Xcode - select and then two more dashes and install and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go and install Visual Studio code so you're gonna go to code Digital Studio dot-com and just click on download for Mac whenever you do that you're gonna see this little guy down here pop-up and of course you're gonna click on that and then click on open and then you're going to download Visual Studio code and you're gonna drag it into your Applications folder then we're gonna open up visual studio code and you're gonna come over here on the left side of the screen where it says extensions and click on that then over here you're going to see C and C++ this guy right here and you're gonna click on install after you have that all set up you're gonna come over here and click on reload and everything is going to be installed in regards to C and C++ we're then going to come in here and verify all this and how you're gonna do this is you're gonna come in here and set up your settings and you're gonna come over here and click on this little widget and then click on settings and then inside of here you're gonna be able to do things like change your font size or define new fonts or whatever you want to use and what I do is I just copy you know premier pasted him over here and then make the changes that I would like and I prefer to have a bigger text so I changed that and I don't like the Menlo typeface so I went and got rid of it and just put Monaco in there instead and what you're gonna do is come up here and go file and save workspace as I typed in C++ taught one dot code whatever you can name it whatever you want it to you don't be named and then click on save and you're gonna come over here and click on your file explorer and you're gonna click on add folder and then you're gonna be able to define wherever you want your folder to be defined and he gonna click on add after that just to verify that c++ is working you're gonna create a new file and then you can just type in exactly what I have here on the screen and make sure it's exactly the same then what we're gonna do is come up here and go view and command palette click on that then you're gonna type in tasks and you're gonna come down here and click on configure task after that it's gonna give you the option of create task JSON file from template and you're gonna click on that then you're gonna come down here where it says others and click on that then this guy is gonna pop up inside of here everything is perfectly fine you don't need to make any changes just want to verify that everything looks basically like this and you see g plus plus that just means that it was able to find g plus plus that you installed earlier in this tutorial then you're going to open up extensions again by clicking this guy right here and you're gonna type in code with a space followed boy Runner and then you know click on install this guy's gonna open up you're gonna click on reload now what you're gonna be able to do inside of your hello world dot CPP file is just right click on your screen and run codes gonna open up here and your click on that and then you're gonna see down here that hello world prints out so you know that C++ is properly set up inside a visual studio code now we're gonna set up Arduino so you're going once again click on extensions and you're gonna type in platform I owe - IDE and this guy's gonna pop up you're gonna click on install then it's gonna open up on the right side of your screen you're gonna click on reload then down here in the bottom of your screen you're gonna see installing platform IO IDE you're gonna have to sit here and wait it might take you a minute or whatever but you're gonna have to sit and wait until it all installs and then whenever you see it's a platform IO IDE has been successfully installed everything fine so you're gonna click on reload now and then you're gonna see this guy pop up and this is where we're gonna run art or Arduino projects so you're just gonna click on new project and then you're gonna search until you find Arduino Uno or at least that's what I'm using and then you're gonna select the framework is also gonna be Arduino and then click on finish and this guy's gonna open up you're gonna have a project down here and you're gonna click on open and then you can type in exactly what I have right here and this is just going to be a blink test so type in everything I have there you can click on the pause button and your Arduino whenever you plug it into the back of your computer it's already gonna be blinking so you can just change the delay maybe to 500 to 100 just so you can see that the code actually changed the Arduino and this is going to be in your main CPP file where you're gonna put this and that is going to be located over here in the source directory and then to upload to your Arduino you're gonna come down here and you're going to compile everything by clicking on this little check mark that's right here and then after everything is built you're gonna click on this to upload it to the Arduino and of course you have to have the Arduino plugged into the back of your computer and then you're gonna notice that the blink rate has changed so there you go that is how we are able to set up C and C++ as well as Arduino on visual studio code hope you guys found that useful and like always please leave your questions and comments below otherwise until next time
