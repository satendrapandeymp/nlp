hello everyone and today I'm going to show you how you can install Xcode within a Windows computer for free now this is something really cool that I'm sure lots of you want to know if you want to get into either Mac application programming or iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch application programming now when traditionally this is something that would have to be done within a Mac computer as the software that's used to program the applications called Xcode is only available for the Mac but in this video I'll show you how we can get around that and install it within Windows and so let's get started so the first thing that you're going to need to do is to get a free program called VirtualBox I've made a few made a few videos on this and it basically allows you to run other operating systems within Windows so if you haven't got this already you can head over to VirtualBox go over to their website and that link will be in the description but once you've got VirtualBox installed you where you'll want to open it up and install mac OS X Mountain Lion within it now this might sound like quite a daunting thing to do but of them I've got a video on this it's actually not that hard to do it'll only take around 10 15 20 minutes to get everything together and then just leave it to get it installed but anyway that isn't for this video I showed you how to do that in another one that will be linked on screen or in the description but anyway when you assume that you've already done that and we can carry on getting xcode so if we just open up OS X Mountain Lion and the way that I did this was is if you've just installed it is it that you'd click on OS X Mountain Lion and just press start at the top there but once you've done that you can open it up and now you want to open the Mac App Store which is this icon on the dock just down here so once this is opened you can just type into the top Xcode and I said that this would be ridiculously simple and it is once you've installed Mac OS X Mountain Lion in VirtualBox it is as simple as just pressing this button here install app and now I just need to enter my account information and as I'm sure you've realized if you don't have an Apple account then it's you know really simple just create Apple ID all you need is a an email address and a password you shouldn't have to link any bank details or anything like that as it's a free program better like I said if I'm just gonna you know just enter my information here for sign-in and hopefully this will get downloading why don't as you can see we've got a little progress bar down here and it says it's downloaded just under - Matt well - Matt now out of 1.6 five gigabytes and it's going to take a little while so I'm going to pause the video and come back once it's done by then so that should be done in just a minute okay so now Xcode has just recently finished downloading and installing so now we can carry on with the process by opening it up so all we have to do is press on the launchpad icon down here to get a list of all of our applications and xcode should now be on this list and here it is here so we can just press on that and it should open no problem alright so we can just press agree on the license agreement we have to install this there's an end to my password and right so this shouldn't take too long now but once again I'll just pause the video and then come back once is installed right so as you as you can see we've now finished installing and updating Xcode so we can start using it just by pressing this button down here what so this is brilliant we now have Xcode set up and ready to work so I hope you enjoyed this video it's a really impressive thing to do that you can install Xcode and install map applications using VirtualBox on a Windows computer so once again I hope you enjoyed this if you could leave it a like if this worked for you or if you need any help just leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible but thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
