hey guys it's Kate welcome to YouTube channel today I'm going to teach you how to use any font you guys want to on your website using the app font face rule so first off I have my index.html open up here at the top and down here I have my main CSS inside my folder I have both of these files here and then I have a fonts folder with Roboto which is Google's font and all the different styles I want to include so this works with multiple weights and font styles and you can also use as many fonts as you want today we're just going to be using one and I'm going to show you how to do this before we start these are the font formats you want to try to use TTFN OTF and Wolfe which is WOFF are probably your best bet and covering all modern browsers SVG EOT and Wolfe two are not supported by a lot of different browsers so I highly recommend you don't use them at all so let's get started so this website currently has a heading tag and a paragraph tag and then I've applied some styles to the body and the HTML in general just to make it look centered like this so here's what our font is going to look like and I'm going to want to change this to Roberto now so let's get started doing that so the first thing you're going to need to include is the @ font face rule itself so @ font dash face and that is the start of the rule so I'm going to open that up in curly brackets and the first thing we need to do is give this a name so font family and I'm going to name this Roboto just because I'm using Roberto font keep it nice and simple the next thing you want to do is the source and this is going to be a URL and inside of here I have mine in a fonts folder so if you have yours in a different folder you need to make sure you include that or won't link properly and inside of fonts mine is called Roboto - thin dot TTFN now I'm going to set the font style and this is normal and we're going to set the font weight to 100 so let's apply this now to our paragraph tag sometimes ap font family and let's set this to Roberto and then I'm also going to set the weight to the weight we just provided which is 100 if i go back to google chrome now you can see my paragraph tag has successfully changed over to Roboto thin so let's apply a black style to our heading now so to apply another font weight all we have to do is say at font face again and inside of here font family and I'm going to name this Roboto as well so for the source this time it's going to be my fonts folder and it's going to be called Roboto - black so my font style is normal as well and this time on my font weight I'm going to give this a value of 600 so now we can apply this to our h1 so I'm just going to actually copy this from the paragraph and change this value to 600 save that and now we should have a successfully changed heading which we do so now our heading is nice and a black bold font and this is a nice light thin so that is how to include whatever font you guys want to on your website I hope you guys found this useful if you did please leave a like on this video and as always I hope you guys have a great day and I will see you guys in the next one thanks for watching the video guys be sure to give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it on the left is my previous video just in case you missed it on the right is YouTube's recommendation just for you and the top center icon is my channel icon click that to subscribe for more content just like this I hope you guys have a great day and I'll see you guys in the next one
