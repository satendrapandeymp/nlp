okay so I'm going to go over how to make an image map I introduced it in class it's just there's a good amount of steps and it's a little too hard to just type out on this blog here so you can use the sample code that's on here and bring it in to text or angular and open it up and so you see it here so there's two areas you are saying show the picture and then have the picture cut up into sections so up here you're showing the picture which is cups JPEG and you have you can say that the width and the height of it and what's important here is you have this used map equals then right here it says cup map that links it to down here the second part which is the actual map and what this is doing is in each area it's cutting it up into different sections it can be done in three ways you can join as a rectangle a circle or a polygon if it's a rectangle you want the x and y coordinates of the top left corner and then the X and y coordinate to the bottom right corner making a box and then you want to say where it goes so href equals and I have this going to CNN you can also do a circle if you do a circle you say the coordinates of the x and y of the middle of the circle where you want it to go and the radius of it and this is going to New York Times and then you can also have a polygon which if you do a polygon you can pretty much make almost whatever shape that you want so you can use this to kind of make a pyramid or an octagon or any crazy kind of shape it's a little more complicated because you need to know the X&Y coordinates of each point that you want to use so here's one set of coordinates a second set a third set and then the fourth set here so you might ask yourself how exactly do you know where the x and y coordinates are on it on the image that you want to cut up so get the image you want to use and then what you want to do is you want to open up in Photoshop and so here's the image I'm going to use an image of a couple cups so we need to be able to have Photoshop tell us where this mouse is where the X&Y are actually located so to do that you need to do two things you need to show certain panel and that panel is the info panel it's right here you notice that if I move the master you can now actually see where the X&Y is here and then to get to that panel you have to go to window and make sure the info panel is checked off and if you do that and you sit under the 8 bit X&Y you're saying very very small numbers that's because your ruler is set to show in two inches or something else besides pixels so if that's the case you have to go up to Photoshop preferences units & rulers and make sure rulers is in pixels you'll know it's in pixels because this number up here should relate to from the left of the image to the right of the image roughly how big the image is so now that you have that you can start cutting it up so we want this will say this is going to be a rectangle so we find the top left corner let's real say which is 7 and 61 we have to go back into the document and TextWrangler and I did this already but here 7 and 61 and back into Photoshop to find the bottom right of it so 54 and 137 so after you do all of that save the document and then now you can see it when I double-click on it I have an image map you know if there's a link on it you know what areas are actually cut up because when you move your mouse over that area the mouse changes in this case it's a little Mickey Mouse and so here I cut it up I cut it up over here I cut this up over here and then you see when I move off the area it goes back to the normal Mouse and let's say I click on an image the section of the image and this goes to CNN this one I have going to New York Times it says up here just really slow and this one is going to Yahoo so that's pretty much how how do you make an image map you can cut up an image into many many sections you can use this for your to create your digital stories a lot of times people use it for creating navigation bars as well and websites so that's pretty much a tutorial you get a little bonus if you can figure out how to get this blue border around the image to turn off all right
