welcome to the 27th tutorial on beginning CSS we're going to look at the span HTML element in this video and like the div element it goes hand-in-hand with CSS so that's why we're going to deal with this element in the CSS series now a span is similar to the div but on a much smaller scale a span element is inline and selects a small chunk of HTML so maybe some text or something inside a paragraph and so again it's inside an element as opposed to the div which selects several elements so if we open up our HTML code we can see that first div that we created in the last video this div main we've got several elements here we've got a header element we've got a paragraph element now a span might select some text inside a individual element so again a div compromises several elements a span works inside a individual element that's why it's called a inline element so again you may want to select some text here now one of the popular ways to use the span HTML element is to highlight some text that you want to stand out on your web page so let's go to our individual paragraph that we created of course with this ID and what do we want to highlight in here let's highlight this area right here that says hagfish lampreys and bony fish so what we're going to do is we're going to put a span so we'll embed this and I just cut and paste this right here I had already typed it out so this is going to be a class so what does a class mean that means again we'll create a class in our style sheet in a moment of course we're going to call it highlight so again here's the HTML element span and then like every HTML element we need to close it and where do we want to close this will close this after a bony fish so let's do that and let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and open up our style sheet now we'll go the way down here and let's create a class and again I already had this typed out so I'll just copy and paste the class in here now we're just going to make this a generic class so remember the period identifies it as a class and then everything that is tagged with highlight will get highlighted with the highlight class and then so we're going to use a background color and this is yellow so it will be highlighted in yellow so let's go ahead and save this now let's open up our web page and there you can see we've got a highlight now so we selected this HTML text with our span HTML element now we can do some other things too we can we can actually make some this 32,000 here for instance we can make that red so let's go ahead and do that and so let's go back into our HTML and let's find that 32,000 and I'll go ahead and copy and paste what I already typed out now we're going to use this style remember style is for inline and so again this is a different way we can specify our CSS so in this one we created a class we put it in our style sheet and this one we're just going to embed the CSS right into our HTML so we'll use the style attribute and again we've used that before we're going to make this red we want this to stand out and then of course we need to close out the span of course so let's go ahead and save this let's open up our web page and there you see we have the text now in red so again one way to think of the span and dilled elements think of them like containers with the div we are putting all these elements in a container with the span we are putting stuff in a container just inside an individual element okay that is going to do it for this video I will see you guys in the next video
