hello everyone welcome to another lecture on XHTML and CSS this lecture we will talk about doctype declarations adding XHTML namespaces defining metadata and what are the deprecated elements on XHTML okay so first of all let's open index and make sure you have your browser ready as well now you know how to create a simple web page or XHTML page we already created we have this index dot HTML but before we can start declaring this XHTML page or web page or website fully functional and official we need a declaration doctype and what is the declaration talkto all XML files needs a declaration doctype it specifies which version of HTML or XHTML they are using so if you are using HTML 4.01 you have three different kinds of dog types you can use which is the transitional the straight and the frameset in order for you to understand better this you can go doc type declarations in wikipedia and you can search down here the different here you have the HTML 4.01 doctype declarations you can use okay so you have here the strict here you have the transitional and he have the frameset but this is a very old code and we are using the new one xhtml 1.0 so this is what you have to copy one of these and paste it on the top of your page or your code of XHTML now the one that you should choose and the most used one nowadays is the transitional which is this one here copy and paste it here at the top of the index dot HTML page and save this ok so now we have our doctype declaration now this is an official web XHTML page and code with the doctype at the top of the page the transitional doctype is the most common and most used among developers on the web because the strict and the frameset are almost deprecated and for common web pages we need to use the transitional doctype okay so make sure you have this at the top of your web page or your code in all of your files ok make sure you put this on of your file so let's go to the top here paste this save the about pages well save and admin 1 as well and save okay perfect ok now obviously you should know about all these different dog types for the old XHTML or HTML but for the new html5 version the only thing we need to create a doctype as this ok this is the only thing that we will need to declare the doctype and we will not need xml and ass as well this is how easy it is with html5 okay but we will get into html5 later on this course now there's another thing you can use in your code which is the xml namespace and to add the yacht's ml namespace we need to go to the opening tag of HTML and give it a space and then type xml and ass which stands for xml namespace equals two double quotes and then you have to type a URL which is the HTTP and it's the double double ww3 dot org slash 1999 slash XHTML now let's say this and just for curiosity let's click this link and open it and let's see where it goes okay so it goes to a page called w.org and it has some definitions explaining the what is the namespace or what is the namespace of XHTML and basically a lot of manuals and data we have here okay now I'm gonna just give you a little introduction of this and we will cover it more deeply on the XML chapter w3.org or w3c it's stands for a World Wide Web Consortium and basically these are the guys or the consortium that gives the rules to use the markup languages that we have on the web for creating websites so let's have a namespace here okay I already did here it is we just need to put this on the HTML opening tag and that's it that's basically okay we'll talk more about this on the XML chapter now we have also meta tags meta tag are defined inside the head tags in here and after the title meta tags refers or gives information to the web browser about data on your web site it basically describes your web page so you have several different meta data or meta tags you can use meta data for a page may include for example keywords for the search optimization search engine optimization description of the page information about the page author and more subjects that describes your page or your platform or application on the web okay so let's define a few metadata or meta tags for our simple website in this case the first meta data we should define is in what characterization we are using our content of the page of the web page either it's in English or we use characterization for different kind of languages foreign languages like Arabic or maybe some Chinese or Japanese so we are using English so we have to define it here with this meta http-equiv equals now we type content type and here we type content equals two text HTML and semi column and a space and then we type char set characterization sets - and here is where we have to type utf-8 okay now this this is the code make sure you end it here with Slash and utf-8 it's the characterization used for english characterization of the content or text now if you want to use another characterization or set to another characterization for foreign languages you'd have to go and search for the other codes so let's type here char said goats okay so we have HTML char set list and this will give you the all the different kind of characterization you can use for different languages like such Chinese Korean Western alphabet okay and here is the utf-8 which stands for Universal alphabet okay guys so make sure you use the utf-8 in the meta characterization and here let's create more meta tags like for example the keywords we want to use we type meta name equals and here you can type k WR d stands for keyword and now space night content equals double quotes now you type the all the keywords we you want to use so you can be searched on google or your webpage can be searched and rank on other search engines like Bing from Microsoft okay let's say we have a website about an online store about let's say computers so we can type store pcs computer let's say sell buy cheap okay whatever you remember and you want to use as your keyword for search engine optimization you can use it here or you have to put it in here okay this is up to you to choose the keywords you want now let's close this and let's type a description of the website so you type meta name equals desc okay for description then you type content equals two let's tie for example online store for computers for selling computers something like that okay great and close it okay there is also a very very curious meta tag shall make your user to be redirected to another page after X seconds or how many seconds you want so let's do that and try and see if it works so let's type here meta and to do that you type HTTP HTTP equiv and then equal double quotes and you type refresh and then content equals to the seconds you want to give the user to wait to be resent to or redirect it to so user will open this page index.html and after 10 seconds he will be redirected to this page here let's make after the 10 type semi column space and type URL equals to HTTP HTTP slash W and now we can type w3c dot org okay and close it here with double quote and it's slash okay let's save this let's run this in chrome and see if it works so we are here let me just wait 10 seconds and see if we are redirected let's see and there it is perfect it works perfectly so this is kind of a tricky way you can use to redirect your users whenever you want to whatever page you want after 10 seconds passes now before we end this video I would recommend you to instead of using key wrd make sure you use keywords so that we recognize for all web browsers and also we still miss the meta for the Alpha ok the author for the web page so here we type author and also here we type name and then we have type victor passes okay so make sure you type your name in here or the name of the company which is the author of the website and let's also change here desk for description okay so desk and key wrd are acceptable but in case of doubt make sure you type the full name keywords' okay so it can be searched for all engines search engines either Google being in Yahoo and also it can be read by all browsers so make sure you type the full description and full keywords name now the last thing about this lecture is deprecated elements and deprecated elements basically are tags that are not available or are not recommendable to use any more on XHTML by the way I have an error here instead of name here should be content okay so that's it and see you guys later bye
