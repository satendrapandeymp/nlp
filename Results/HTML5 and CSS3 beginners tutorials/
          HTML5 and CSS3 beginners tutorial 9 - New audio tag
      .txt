hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinn's in here and welcome to tutorial number nine and in this video I'm going to show you guys how to add audio to your website using the new html5 audio tag now like I said this audio tag is new to html5 so because it is a new tag there are some browsers that might not support this tag or if someone is using a browser that hasn't been updated in a while so let's say they are using Google Chrome or Firefox but it just hasn't been updated in a long time then this tag might not work for them either okay so to add an audio tag to your web page you're just going to go ahead and type in audio like that in a tag but it is a double tag so we're going to close it off as well okay and because this is actually not enough information we're still going to have to tell the browser some how what file to include okay so we've got another tag that we can put inside here which is the source and this is actually we will be placing our source attribute as well now the reason for this is some browsers might not support one file type so they might not support mp3 then you have to put in multiple source tags so you'll put in a source for google chrome which supports mp3 and then you'll put in another source tag for firefox that in that supports OGG or something like that okay but actually most browsers all support mp3 so if you're using Firefox or you're using Google Chrome we should get away with just using an mp3 file okay but before we get into the attributes I also want to just tell you if the user is using an old browser okay this audio tag isn't going to work for them it's not really going to show up so what we can do is include a message in between this audio tag just to say to the user that they need to update their browser ad won't show up if the audio tag does work so if they're using a browser that is already up to date then the message won't show up but if they're using an out-of-date browser then the message will show up okay so we can just say if you can see this update your browser okay so hopefully they don't see this message but if they do they need to update their browser okay and now we can talk about the attributes so there's actually a few attributes that we're going to need to include over here and the first one obviously is the source attribute and we can set this equal to the file that we want to include on our page okay so I've got this audio file here too mp3 file which I downloaded from YouTube's audio library and it's basically just some free music that YouTube offers there so I'm going to go ahead and set Garage dot mp3 okay and that should work for us for now but there's also another attribute that we need to include and that is the type okay and the type is basically just telling the browser what audio file they should be expecting okay well it should be expecting should I say okay so because this is an mp3 then we know that the browser should be expecting a an audio slash MPEG file okay so like I said the reason why this is set up like this in a different tag is because what's a single tag so you can close that off is because let's say if you wanted to test this in a few browsers and you found out that maybe opera or something does not support an mp3 then you can go ahead and put in another tag here with a file like OGG which it does support okay and then you just have to make sure whoops you just have to make sure that you have not only an mp3 here but an OGG file as well but that might be a little bit complicated for some of you guys so let me just get back to notepad plus plus here and we can just take that line out we really don't need it right now because we've only got an mp3 okay but there is one file or one other attribute that we're gonna have to include here and that is going to be in these audio tags we're going to specify that we want some controls okay so the controls are going to show up in the browser and they might look different on every browser so unless you want to make your own controls with JavaScript then you need to actually specify these controls so that the user will be able to push play pause and rewind etc okay so let's go ahead and save this now and if I go back to Firefox and click refresh you can see I now have this little audio thing here which I can push play and if it ever push play it's going to play the music so that I guess that's cool but then there's two other attributes which I can talk to you guys about as well and that would be the autoplay so photo play and loop loop okay sorry typos so autoplay basically tells the browser when this when the webpage is finished loading just play the music okay just don't even wait for the user to click play or anything just play it and loop is basically when you get to the end of the track just start it over again so let's go back now and I'll save that first and click refresh here and as soon as I click refresh the music is going to start playing and well I'll make it loop I'll click on the end and I'll make it loop again okay so let's click refresh and as you can see the music starts playing so if I go ahead and I fast-forward this right to the end okay as soon as it ends it's going to jump right back to the beginning and start playing okay so that's what loop does that a loop just makes it restart again and autoplay basically makes it that as soon as the webpage loads the song plays okay now let me show you what happens if we didn't include the controls tag or controls attribute okay then that would mean that we have no way of telling the music to play or stop or pause or anything so right now we've still got the autoplay here and the loop okay so now when I click refresh we're not going to have this thing but the music's going to play as soon as I click refresh okay and I can't stop it so yeah can I just need to delete it or exit close it okay and that's actually all I have for you guys in this video so thanks for watching
