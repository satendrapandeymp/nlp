hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we have learned how do we float elements to the left of a container by applying left value to the float CSS property in this video tutorial I am going to discuss what happens when we apply a value right to CSS float property so let's get started I go to start type notepad I click on notepad then here I write opening HTML tag closing HTML tag opening head tag closing head tag opening body tag closing body tag in the head section I am going to write opening title tag and say CSS float demo closing title I saved the file file save as I save the file on desktop with the name float demo dot HTML both sides I put double quotations and click on the Save button I minimize the notepad file you can see that flow demo dot HTML page got created I right click on it open with the Firefox you can see that float demo dot HTML page got open and title ii said to CSS flow demo in the body i am going to create three div elements opening give and I give I D of div 1 and I put content div 1 closing div I create one more div element I am going to copy that paste it down and the ID is going to be changed to dev 2 and content is going to be tiptoe I paste once again this is going to be dev 3 and Dave 3 file save go to browser and refresh you can see that D 1 D 2 D 3 are created one below another quite simple in the head section I am going to write style type text or CSS then I say closing style tag in between I am going to write some styles for every div element I am telling to the browser that locate every development in this current page apply border of 1 pixel solid line black color semicolon file save go to browser and fresh you can see that border are added to every development and we know that gives our block level tags they start always on new fresh line and they take the entire available width then I apply the width of 100 pixel semicolon height of 100 pixel and font - size of 24 point semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that divs are created with all Styles applied now I am going to tell to the system that locate a do which has the ID do 1 and apply background color background - color of cyan semicolon file save go to browser and refresh next I tell to the system locate a div which has the ID - div - and it should be having the background color magenta file save go to browser and refresh similarly I am going to copy that and paste it down and this is going to be deep 3 and it is going to have background color of yellow file save go to browser and refresh so now we have three divs with Styles applied in this tutorial as I told I am going to discuss about float:right so to the new one I am going to apply float righ T right so here I am assigning a value right to float property what happens we understand file save go to browser when i refresh what happens is as I told every container is going to have one float layer on top of it when we apply float right on an element it is going to be moved out of the normal flow are taken out of the container and placed on a float layer to the right side so at present do one is on floor layer you can see that it is taken out of the body container layer as there is nothing at present in this place in the body container layer definitely our div 2 and div 3 are going to be moved up there will be no problem you can see that if I go and refresh you can observe that carefully like the one is to the right of the container layer and now it is on the floor layer div - and if they are moved up quite simple similarly I can apply float right on div do also FL o 80 float righ T right semicolon if I say float right on dev to file save go to browser and refresh this div 2 is going to be floated to the float layer you can say like this div 2 is going to be taken out of the normal flow and it is taken out of the container layer and moved on to the float layer as I told that when we apply the float property on any block level element it turns into an inline level element and you can see that that is the reason div 1 and due to our seated one beside another quite simple as there is nothing in this place in the body container layer this dip 3 is going to be moved up deep 3 is going to be moved up quite simple try to understand it so div 1 and u 2 will be 1 beside another and div 3 is going to be in the body layer let me show that if I go here and refresh you can see that div 1 and F 2 are one beside another and they are floated to the right and they turn into inline level elements you can see and give 3 is now in the body layer placed on the left hand side similarly if I say here FL o 80 float righ T float right now we are applying float right to the div 3 element also file save go to browser and refresh div 3 element is also going to be moved out of the normal flow or it is going to be taken out of the container layer and it is going to be placed beside div 2 on the float layer so I go here and say refresh you can see that they've one div 2 and D 3 R 1 beside another and you should remember that there is nothing at present available in the body layer or a body container layer you can see that if any another element is there it is going to be moved up so at present we have only div 1 - 2 - 3 they are seated one beside another and they are flowing from right to left quite simple and as we know that div 1 div - div 3 all these three are divs only instead of writing float:right in each of them we can remove these float rights I can remove this also and simply I can go to div and tell that every day should be floated to write simple file save go to browser and refresh you can see that they are floating from right to left if I remove this control X file save go to browser and refresh D 1 D 2 and D 3 are now in a body container layer and they are one below another if I say here float : left semicolon our lives are going to be floated left and they are placed one beside another D 1 div 2 tip 3 I remove this again control X file save go to browser and refresh normal flow and then I say float right this time righ T right file save go to browser and refresh they are floated from right to left 1 2 3 let me bring it back again control X file save go to browser and refresh they are now in the container layer and they are in normal flow let us discuss still more control we can perform or we can do we can control the placement of divs now here I say I go to D 1 and set FL o 80 float righ T right semicolon now this new one is going to be floated to right file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it is floated to the right and give two and you three are moved up if the ones float right property should not affect the div 2 then what we can do is we can say here clear righ T right then what happens is div 2 is going to be placed back and Dave 3 is going to be placed back in their place you can see that div 2 and F 3 are moved down similarly if I say here FL whoa 80 float righ T right semicolon file save go to browser if i refresh div 1 and M 2 are going to be placed one beside another as there is nothing at the div 2 and do one place div 3 is going to be moved up refresh you can see that tip three is placed in the body container layer whereas d1 and d2 are one-piece add another on the floor layer similarly if you do not want this dip three to be affected by dev tools float:right property we can simply say here CL EA are clear righ T right semicolon file save go to browser and refresh when we refresh it is going to be placed back to the div to place you can see that we can control a lot of things by using the clear attribute I am going to remove this I am going to remove this also I am going to remove this also file save go to browser and refresh they are in the normal flow again I say here FL o eighty float righ T right semicolon file save go to browser and refresh you can see that D 1 is floated to the right div 2 & 3 are moved up what I can do is I can clear the float right CL EA are clear righ T right when I say clear right div 2 is not going to be affected by dowon's float:right property you can see that it is moved back into its place what I can do now again is I can say here float righ T right semicolon now again I am applying I am clearing the float right and then I apply applying the float right what happens this time is as we have cleared it is moved to its place but as we are applying float right it is going to be floated to the right it is going to placed below the do one element if i refresh you can see that div 1 and div to our one below another as there is nothing in D 1 and D 2 place div 3 has been moved up it's quite simple similarly I can say here clear CL EA are clear righ T right semicolon when we say clear write as float div 1 and div 2 both are affected by float right they are moved towards right file save go to browser and refresh you can see that div 3 element is at the bottom in its place so we have cleared that div 2 element by saying clear right hence div 3 is in its normal place similarly I can say in this place FL o 80 float righ T right there what happens we know that Dave 3 is going to be placed below Dave to refresh do you want Dave to do three are placed one below another now you can decide how you can use these float and clear properties to create layouts or placement of the objects according to your requirement that is all about float property and a clear property at present for this tutorial I think this much is enough I suggest you to watch this video again and again and understand by using the mspaint are some any image editing tools and understand how exactly the things are working in the next tutorial we get some more information on HTML CSS for more benefits and be updated please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with everyone so that everybody should get benefited keep learning keep curling keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much
