hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and this is tutorial number 33 and in this tutorial we are going to take a look at some new tags that were made for laying out websites in html5 now I'm not sure if you guys would have heard about these tags before but I didn't explain them in my previous tutorials because I was actually waiting right up until this moment so that it would all make sense but if you guys watched my div tutorial so my tutorial on divs then you will know that a div tag is basically a big block that we can put on our web page and it doesn't make any visual changes to the website whatsoever unless we actually use CSS later on to style that div okay so if I created a div and I actually put some content in here then you know that content would look like normal content until I actually applied some styling rules to this div now the same thing applies to these new tags that we got in html5 they don't actually change the website in any way until we style them so they're equivalent to a div tag but they have more descriptive names because div could be anything it could be any kind of section or any kind of block but the guys at html5 or the guys who designed html5 rather decided well hey if you take a look at any web sites so I'm going to go over to my YouTube channel but it doesn't really matter what web site you look at you're going to see that pretty much all web sites follow the same kind of pattern whenever there they get made okay so in this case we've got YouTube over here and at the top we have a section over here where we've got a logo some search bars or a search bar some buttons you know some links whatever but this is going to be the same across every YouTube page you ever go to you're going to see this header okay and that's what this thing is it's a header same thing with Facebook you put the Facebook logo search bar whatever and Twitter same thing their Twitter logo search bar some links so that would be your actual page header and it doesn't change across all websites so all websites have a page header and the guys at html5 realized this and decided well hey we can make a new tag called header and whenever people are designing websites they can use this header tag to create their headers and the advantage of that is now we as designers know okay well header means that this is where my header is going to be so instead of using a div tag you now have a tag with a more descriptive name which is header okay and again another advantage to this would be that if you were using or if you were trying to get ranked by a good search engine like Google or I don't know if you know if you guys consider being a good search engine or not but if you were trying to get ranked by one of those search engines when those search engines come and view your site they can see that a header tag is on your website so this obviously this section contains a header and yeah like it just means that BOTS can understand your website better as well so that's one cool thing we're using header now let's go over here and take a look at our next section which is the navigation okay and you know all websites have a navigation so YouTube we actually have to click on the navigation to get it to show Twitter the navigation is actually like inside the header same thing with Facebook inside the header so we also got that tag a new tag called nav which stands for navigation and this is whenever you want links to other pages etc you will put that in your navigation section or your nav tags okay go back to YouTube over here you'll see we now have this big section in the middle over here and this is my channel and it is pretty much the whole reason why you would come to this specific URL on YouTube is to see my channel you can see the header or the navigation on any page but you can only see my channel on this exact page right here so the section is like the meat of that web page or that website so yeah well web page would be a better word so the section is basically the meat of why the user came to this exact URL okay and you know that is called the main section or in youtube or HTML terms the section tag so in the section tag that is where you're going to put your main content okay again if we go back to YouTube now let's take a look at the side section over here and as you can see this actually contains some more navigation but it's also got some playlists and other information and some settings and whatnot so this is a side section and if you take a look at Facebook or Twitter you will also see that there's a side section across from all the main content so pretty much all web sites have a side section whether they use it for nav or whether they use it for ads or something like that all websites you seem to have a side section so we got given that as a tag called a side and this is basically where you will put the less important stuff for your website but you know still kind of important like links or ads or something like that so we have the aside section okay other than the aside section if we go back to YouTube here and scroll all the way down we have this section at the bottom and this is going to look the same across pretty much every single YouTube page and that is YouTube's footer okay same thing with Facebook same thing with Twitter if you scroll all the way down they tend to update quite a lot or quite quickly so the footer like as soon as you scroll down to the footage just disappears and goes further down the page but they do indeed have a page footer okay and pretty much all websites you see nowadays will have a page footer so let's go over here and just place in our footer tag and those are the new tags that we use in html5 to create our website layouts okay so I really hope this tutorial came in handy and don't forget to join me in the next tutorial where we are going to start learning how to actually use these tags to create a website layout or a web page layout so I will see you guys in the next video and until then don't forget to subscribe please feel free to leave a comment like or share this video it's really going to help my
