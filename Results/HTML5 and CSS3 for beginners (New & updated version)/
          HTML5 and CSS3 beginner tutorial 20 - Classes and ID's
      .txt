hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 20 and in this tutorial we're gonna talk about classes and ID's so in the previous tutorial we talked about divs and spans and I showed you the difference between inline and block level elements and we're gonna take that one step further with some more different spans in this tutorial but I'm going to show you guys how to really leverage the power of that with some classes and ID's so right now I have a paragraph on the page and this paragraph if i zoom in a little bit you can see it just has normal text right now but I do want this line over here to be green and then I want this line over here to be red and then I want this last sentence over here to have some blue text right so taking a look at this in the browser right now if i zoom in it's all pretty much normal text it's not styled right so I'm gonna surround my green sentence with a span tag and then I'm going to end that off over here and then I'm gonna surround my red text with another span tag and I'm gonna end that off at the end of the read sentence and then for the last sentence the blue sentence I'm gonna also create a span tag and I'm gonna end that off at the end of the census right so now all of them are surrounded in span tags and we know from the previous tutorial that I can style a span so now because I wanted green text over here I could just go select my span tag oops select my span tag and then type in color green and that'll change the text color to green so if I come back here and hit refresh well now it's changed all of our spans and all of the text in us bands to green so we might want something a little bit more unique to identify this green text and we want might want something else more unique to identify this red text and again we want something more unique to identify the blue text so this is where classes come in handy because now I can take my first span tag and give that a class of green and then I can go over to my second span tag where I want red text and I can give that a class of red and in fact this might just look a little bit more tidy if I put all my spans on a new line even though they won't display in a new line it's just gonna look at idea right you can see this better and then let's give the last one a class of blue right so now we've got these three classes over here and because I want this one to be green I want to select this element by its class so I'm gonna jump back over to my CSS file and then I'm gonna remove that span selector and I'm gonna add in a new selector here so I'm gonna start off with a period or a full stop or a dot or whatever you want to call this thing and what that does is tells CSS yo listen up we are gonna use a class to style our content and the class name that we want to use is gonna be this class over here which is green and you could obviously name it anything you want it you're not limited to your name as long as you don't have spaces right so you can't have green and then text because these would be two completely separate classes so if you want to name your tech or your class something then it has to be green - text whether it needs to be one word whenever you have two words those are seen as two completely different classes so let's come back here now and now that we've selected our first paragraph or our first span by the class the class of green let's come let's save let's come back over the browser and hit and now you can see that this text is green but the rest of it is all black normal text and we can do the same thing with this red text so let me copy the class or the styling and I'm gonna change this class to the class that we gave to our red text which is in this case is just red and I'm gonna change the color of that to red and we can do the exact same thing for blue so let's go over here and just change that last class to blue and that one says blue as well so that's safe come back here and hit refresh and whoopsie I made a slight mistake I didn't change the color of my blue text to blue right so now that I've done that I've got some green text I've got some red text and I've got some blue text so that's how you identify elements by class and it gives you a little bit more power to actually select text exactly where you want it selected now the same thing applies to IDs right we could also give each one of these spans and ID instead of a class so let me just remove that class and I'll change it to an ID attribute obscene so let's change all our classes to IDs and now we've got an idea green and idea of red and an ID of blue right and if I come back over to my CSS there's something I'm gonna have to change because like I said a full stop tells the CSS hey listen up we're gonna use a class right so if you're ever wanting to style elements with an ID you need to use a different symbol over here because if we save all of this and come back and refresh you'll see that we've lost all our styling the text that was supposed to be green is no longer green and so so on and so forth so to select an element by ID you use the hash cymbal and that tells CSS yo listen up we're gonna select an element by an ID and the ID that we're gonna be using is green or red or blue right so let's save this now and come back to the browser and hit refresh and you can see we've got the exact same result using an ID as we had using the class this text is green that text is red and that text is blue and so on and so forth so you might think to yourself okay yeah I can use classes and ID's interchangeably they're gonna be the same thing wherever whenever and that is sort of okay right you could use classes with an IDs in a very similar way but the the one thing about IDs is you should only ever have one element on your page with the same id so right now this one has an ID of green if I were to copy this and paste this further down where I also wanted some more green text right that's gonna be a problem it might not be a problem in CSS so if i refresh this you can see the the CSS has worked this text has indeed been styled green but if I were to validate this so let's validate by file upload and let me upload my index file right I should get an error because I've used two of the same ID and here you can see duplicate ID so that is a problem right you should never use two elements with the same ID this is especially a problem when you come to learning JavaScript in future if you ever want to select an element by ID and there's suddenly two elements with the same ID it's gonna cause issues right so don't use more than one ID or don't use two elements with the same ID rather if you want elements to have the same kind of styling and you want to use that same class in multiple places use a class don't use an ID and yeah that is all I have for you in this video and I'll see you guys next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at their Mountain they run a coding boot camp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks so check out their website the link is in the description below and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you special thanks to the guys whose names are on screen now these guys contribute five dollars or more on patreon and I really appreciate that while you're still here there are a few other things that you can do to help out so follow me on social media and check out some more of my content and I'll see you guys next time
