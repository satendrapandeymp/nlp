today we want to learn how to insert text inside a website when it comes to HTML we have two different tags we can use in order to insert text inside web sites so the first tag we can use is something called a paragraph tag now a paragraph tag can create by saying P click tap and then inside atom or sublime text we get a pair of paragraph tags that we can then insert text inside of so as you guys can see you can actually go ahead and say hello world which will then when we save it display text inside the browser now the paragraph tag is something that we use note to tell the browser that this is just regular text but what if we want to describe something a bit more special something like a header tag or title tag what I can actually do is I can go and use something called an eight tag now when it comes to eight tags inside HTML we use these in order for the browser or Google to know which text is the most important inside our website so let's say you have a section inside the website that has something with articles inside of it I can go and write a title called latest articles or something so I'm going to go and say latest articles and then one can do is we can actually insert this inside an AIDS tag now when it comes to the AIDS tag we have something called an h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 now depending on the number it tells the browser that this text is the most important inside your website so the h1 tag is going to be the most important header inside your website and h6 tag is going to be the least important tag inside your website so we'll go ahead and say we have latest articles which might be the title of a section I can go and say we have an h2 tag I can say tap and then we get these tags here I'm go ahead and take the text and just move it inside beta-2 tags and now if were to actually save this go inside the browser refresh you guys can see we get some text in here too looks a bit different than a paragraph text who wrote underneath it and that's because browsers have different stylings when it comes to AIDS tags compared to paragraph tags now we can always change it later if you don't want it to look like this but as you guys can see the browser can in fact tell which tag is a header tag and which one is a paragraph tag so if I were to go back inside the code the tank that I just wrote was an h2 tag and like I said h2 is not the most important tag the second most important tag inside the page here so what I can do is I'm going to say well let's say I have the most important tag inside the website I can actually go ahead and write a piece of text that actually describes what is inside this website here so I can next go and say this website is about stuff which again now is not really that descriptive but the point is that this piece of text here might be something that actually describes what the website can actually do and what people can actually use it for so this is really important text of inside maybe my front page here so I can actually go ahead and put this inside a pair of h1 text because this is really important and I want Google to see it when it does actually search my website so now you might be asking when do we need to use h1 tags compared to h2 or h3 h4 and so on and so and so on well it really depends on how important the text needs to be inside your website now at the moment you can only use one h1 tag inside each page of your website because the h1 tag describes what it's most important about this page so the browser does not allow for you to use more than one otherwise it's going to be seen as spam so you only want to use one h1 tag inside each page of your website now for what to give you guys some kind of tip about when to use h1 tag compared to a2 tags or so on and so on and so on the way that I usually do it is I used two h1 tags to describe what this page is actually about then I use a two tags to label titles of each section of the website such as latest articles down here we might have another section that is about a gallery so we can exit go and write gallery inside of it so now we have different headers inside the website now just to give you guys an example of these headers here so you can actually see it inside a real example inside the website that's actually going to leave what we have here and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go and create something called a section tag which is an HTML tag that we use to describe that we have certain content that is similar to each other inside these tags so we can write section tap and then inside the section tags I'm going to write some kind of title for this section so I'm going to say we have an h2 tag that says latest posts then underneath here could actually go and create a sub header for writing h3 and then I could say something like here you can see all the latest toasts like so then I can actually go underneath the tag and create another tag called an article now an article don't get confused by the name because an article is not like a newspaper article or something like that it just means that all the content inside this article tags are related to each other so if we were to go inside the article tags and say we have a post I could go ahead and say that the post title could be something like an h4 tag which then has some kind of title inside of it so we could say this is the post type then I could go underneath here and say we have the actual post which is the text inside the actual post so I would say we have a paragraph that says this is some content inside this post and then at the very bottom you can also add maybe the author of the actual post so we could say it's five and then say author Co one Daniel and now as you guys can see we do have different AIDS tags that has different hierarchy meanings meaning that this is going to be the most important text inside the website at least when it comes to this section here then we have a sub header which is a bit more descriptive and you could argue that these two actually need to be switched around because there's actually more text in here that might describe to section better than the h2 tag up here there's no specific rule that you have to do it a certain way it all depends on what makes more sense when you do actually make the content inside the website so now for what's actually going to save this and go inside the browser we can go and refresh and as you guys can see we now have some text inside the website we had the latest post which is the head of this section here we have the sub header then we have the actual title of the post then we have the content of the post and then the author we can actually go and go back inside the code and say we have a second article which is the second post inside the latest posts save it refresh the browser now you guys can see we have one post here and a second post here so one thing I want to show you guys is we also have something called a break now in the previous episode we talked about empty elements inside HTML which means that we have a tag that does not have a closing tag and rape tag is going to be one of these so if I were to go inside my paragraph and say well in between content and inside I want to shift all the content down to next line so we don't have all of this on one line I can actually go ahead and include a break save it go inside my browser and as you guys can see now we have it shifted down to next line so it breaks here and jumps down so this is how we can actually add headers and text inside the website using HTML I hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time
