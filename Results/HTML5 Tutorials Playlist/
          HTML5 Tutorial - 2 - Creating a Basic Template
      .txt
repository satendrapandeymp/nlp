what's going on guys welcome to your second html5 tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how to set up a very simple html5 website now what we set up in this tutorial you can basically use as a template for all your html5 websites from here on out so let's go ahead and get started the very first thing we need to do is we need to open a blank file now you can either click this button right here or you can go to file note excuse me file new either way we need a new file now for men we need to save this is a HTML document it's very important so go to file save as and I am actually saving all my crap in I made a folder html5 YouTube so go ahead and it doesn't matter what the name is I'm just going to name mine Bucky and you can either hit dot HTML or you can find it in this list of about 6,000 things hypertext markup language file so Bucky HTML very important you have the HTML and save now once we have the core file saved we can go ahead and start typing some crap in here now the very first thing we need is a doctype in before having started I want to mention this I'm going to be telling you guys all the tags that we need and if you don't even know what tags are again I want to stress this one more time make sure you watch my XHTML tutorials and once you do you're going to understand what the heck I'm talking about but let me go ahead and show you guys who already know a little bit about XHTML what we need an html5 website so again like I said we need the doctype so doctype HTML and that's basically all we need aside from the regular HTML tags so how much easier is that then your XHTML huge long you know string of text that you need to copy from the w3 places it's nice clean and simple and don't forget splen a ssin point or whatever it's called that wasn't a typo you actually do need that now after that you need your HTML tags now these HTML tags in in fact a lot of these tags I'm going to be typing in this tutorial are the exact same tags that you need it in XHTML so nothing new here just go ahead and write your HTML tags and anything in between here is basically the our website so your HTML tags they actually need to be a little bit different what you need to do is you need to add an attribute called Lang and you need to set this equal to e and this means basically what language are you using and the language attribute needs to be set to English because I'm speaking English that's why so again that's why we need to add for HTML tags now after that we need of course the head and the body so let's go ahead and do that right now go ahead and so put your header right there and put my body and again these are the exact same as XHTML so to recap one last time in our head goes all the stuff that's kind of the information like the title the CSS styles on the scripts and in our body is what the user sees the body is like the images the paragraphs of text it's where most of the stuff goes so let's go ahead and now add something in the head of our website the very first thing I'm going to be adding and you need to add this too is a meta tag to define the character set so do that by adding meta charset and set this equal to u TF minus 8 or - 8 - 8 whatever heck you want to call it and this is a self enclosed tag so you only need one and I guess I might as well talk to you guys about meta before everyone gets mad at me the character says pretty much how your browser interprets characters it's really techie stuff we don't need to worry about you just need to copy it but anyways character encoding is something like I said we don't need to worry about but meta tags on the other hand you might be seeing these a lot these are other information that your website may need for example keywords a description about your website it's not required but it's nice to have some of these meta tags it's kind of like the credits at the end of the movie you don't really need them but it's kind of nice to have them so that's the only meta tag that is absolutely necessary very the rest like your keywords and description are aren't required so I'm just going to be sticking with the basics for this tutorial now after this let's go ahead and add a title now the title is the thing that appears at the tab or the top title bar if you guys kind of guessed that and I'm just going to name the title of this website Bucky's website and again whenever we view this in a web browser this is what's going to appear on the tab on Google Chrome so now I think okay we actually have one more thing that we need to add I forgot and that is a link to our style sheet and then that's and then we're just going to be adding this previewing it and that's the end of this tutorial so a link is basically a reference to outside a file so we're saying okay first of all I might as well talk you guys through these attributes rel stands for relative and it pretty much means how is this link related to the website so this is a style sheet so we pretty much say okay the file we're about to tell you is going to be a style sheet for this web page so now it needs to know okay so what file is it and for that we use the attribute called href and we set equal to main CSS now ever saying okay what the heck is this file actually this file is a CSS file that we didn't create yet but we're going to be creating it in the upcoming tutorials never saying ok Bucky I wash your CSS tutorials I know that you can just throw all of your CSS on the website right here well yes you can but what I like to do is I like to use my CSS in a separate file because it keeps it a lot cleaner and easier to manage it's always good to have your CSS in any design or appearance files on an outside whit file because we want to keep this thing as simple as possible because we have enough stuff to pack in here so that's why I'm doing that so anyways in order to preview your website go ahead and save it and hit run and launch in Google Chrome and whoa this thing pops up I mean go ahead and minimize that beast and as you can see it says Bucky's website on our title and we didn't add anything to the body if you guys didn't know what the body is it's this crap right here and since our body is empty we have nothing in between those tags that's why we don't see anything yet so again that is your basic basic html5 website again you probably want to copy this and use this template for the rest of your html5 websites again a couple things you want to take note of don't forget to add the doctype the HTML language and also this meta tag so those are very important pieces of information don't forget it now in the next tutorial we're going to be adding some stuff to the body and actually making our website look a little bit prettier so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you then
