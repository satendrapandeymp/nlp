<para> Following is an example where we used <ul type = "square"> </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ul type = "disc"> − </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ul type = "circle"> − </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<header> HTML Ordered Lists </header>
<para> If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with <li>. </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<header> The type Attribute </header>
<para> You can use type attribute for <ol> tag to specify the type of numbering you like. By default, it is a number. Following are the possible options − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "1"> </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "I"> </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "i"> </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "A" > </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "a"> </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<header> The start Attribute </header>
<para> You can use start attribute for <ol> tag to specify the starting point of numbering you need. Following are the possible options − </para>
<para> Following is an example where we used <ol type = "i" start = "4" > </para>
<para> This will produce the following result − </para>
<header> HTML Definition Lists </header>
