in this video we're gonna talk about how to collapse a navbar when your website is being viewed on small devices such as mobile phones and so of course we've been working on all of this code over the last several videos and let's go ahead and fire up our webpage and just take a look at this in chrome really quick now in this view everything's fine we don't mind having our navbar completely expanded out we have lots of room but what happens when we go ahead and collapse this into a smaller view a lot of websites like to take all of the menu items and collapse that into an icon over here on the right called the hamburger icon that's pretty much what it's universally called and you can see it right here this standard hamburger icon and it contains these three bars as you can see and you've probably seen this on several different websites and several different browsers it's kind of the universal icon to expand and collapse menus so that's exactly what we want to do there so we want to take all of these items and basically allow the user when they're on a mobile device or a smaller resolution to collapse the menu in and out with the hamburger icon so let's go ahead and just keep this up for a little bit and we'll just drag this over to the right so what we're going to do is we're going to keep our header which is right here we're gonna keep the header so that we're not gonna collapse we're gonna keep that but then all the rest of this as I said we're gonna go ahead and clap so all of this code that starts right here all the way down here we're gonna collapse all of this and bootstrap gives us a class yes remember it's all about classes bootstrap gives us a class to go ahead and do that and so let's go ahead and close this out and we'll go right back to the code and we're going to go ahead and first create our collapsible bootstrap class and as I said we want to make all of this code collapsible so what we want to do is essentially here create a new div where we can call our collapsible bootstrap class so let's go ahead and do that and actually the exact code that we're gonna make collapsible is all of this code right here everything that includes our links and our form obviously we don't want to claps our entire navbar so we're not going to collapse this and this div relates to our container fluid so we're not gonna collapse that as well but we are gonna collapse as I said the form and all of our links so this code right here is what we're gonna make collapsible so let's go ahead and create or div like I said and then we're gonna go ahead and call our bootstrap class and the class that we're gonna call is collapse you guessed it and so that's the first class that you need to call it's just called collapse and then you need to specify exactly what you're going to make collapsible in this case its course the navbar and then we give that another parameter which is collapse and there we go now we also need to create an ID and I'll talk about this in a little bit but first let's just go ahead and we're gonna create an ID here and we're just gonna call this nav collapse that's all and then we need to close this out of course again we'll talk about this ID in a little bit what we're doing here now of course we need to close out this div down here so we'll just go ahead and copy and paste this one and we'll put this right here and there we go okay so now we've got our bootstrap collapse classes specified and we've wrapped all the code that we want to make collapsible inside this div that's great but we're not done yet now we need to actually create a button that the user can hit to collapse and expand the menu and in this case we want to go ahead and put that button inside of our header remember we're not collapsing the header that's the only thing that will remain so we're gonna put that right inside here and let's go ahead and put it right before our anchor tag now you can also put it after the anchor tag it doesn't really matter but we're gonna go ahead and put it before and what I want to say is that bootstrap will automatically always place the navbar brand on the left so it doesn't really matter where you put the button but I think the standard practice is to put it first now as I said navbar brand will always go on the left so the button that were created this hamburger icon button will actually go on the right so let's go ahead and create our button and of course we need to call the button element and we need to make the type button and then we need to call a bootstrap class and that is navbar toggle and basically this class will make the button expand and collapse that's what this bootstrap class does then we need to use another attribute called data toggle and this basically will automatically assign control to the collapsible element in this case this div right here okay so let's go ahead and complete this and the value that we set this to is collapse now the next attribute is called data target and we're going to go ahead and set that to NAV collapse so basically what this does it allows us to connect this button to this ID so now this button knows exactly what it needs to collapsed or just connecting them together okay so let's go ahead and close our button out and there we go but we're not done yet we need to actually assign an icon to this and there's a couple different ways you can do this and I'm gonna bring up some code here to show you that one is you can actually create three icon bars and this will basically mimic the hamburger icon another way is actually to specify the glyph icon this right here now you might be wondering well why don't we just put the glyph icon in and there is a reason and I'm gonna show you that right now so first let's go ahead and put in this code for our icon and so we're gonna go ahead and just copy and paste that right inside our button right here and there we go it's actually even this out a little bit and you know what I'm always gonna forget something in every video right and we need an hash tag here right we always need that with an ID okay I think everything is gonna work now so let's go ahead and save this and let's fire this up in chrome and see how this looks and that's exactly what we wanted in the largest view right we want all the items displayed on our navbar well let's go ahead and minimize our browser now and if this works all of our items now should be collapsed into that hamburger icon and take a look at that it worked and now look at this we can expand this in and out and again this is what you'll see on a lot of mobile devices this is almost a universal icon now and it's working very well as I said now you're probably wondering why didn't I use the glyphicon well I'm gonna show you why so let's go ahead and close this out and what we're gonna do now is switch to this so we're just gonna copy and paste this over these three spans right here and there we go so now we're actually specifying the hamburger icon so let's save this and let's go ahead and reload this and you're gonna see what happens here take a look you can barely see it yeah the cloud is still working but it's not standing out is it it's sort of grayed out and what I noticed is that in this inverse theme that's where this occurs now let's go back to our code and we're going to switch the inverse to default okay so let's go ahead and save this and let's go ahead and reload this in chrome and take a look now it looks fine so again some of these icons will display differently depending on which theme you're using and as you can see it works great right here in this lighter theme but in the inverse theme it doesn't look so good so again you can use either one of these depending on the theme that you're using I will go ahead and put both of these examples in the description of this video in terms of a paste link okay that's going to do it for this video thanks
