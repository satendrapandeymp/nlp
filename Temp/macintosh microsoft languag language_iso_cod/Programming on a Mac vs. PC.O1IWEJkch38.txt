is your computer on its last legs are you looking for a better machine to use for development if so stick around we'll review the pros and cons of Mac and PC you'll need to know before making a purchase welcome to death the show for new web mobile and game developers I'm Eric Cormier and I'm rob dyrdek it's a question many find themselves asking do I buy a Mac or a PC and more importantly which machine is best for programming for many factors you need to consider when deciding on an operating system we'll talk about the biggest factor first the cost when it comes to Macs many people feel that the price is too damn high for the system and hardware you get buying a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro can cost over $1000 and that's only with minimum specs buying a Mac Mini desktop is cheaper but it can still cost a lot if you're looking for an affordable Mac you'll get stuck with a machine with subpar specs that you can't really upgrade if you're not ready to make it rain at the Apple Store pcs come in a wide array of prices both desktops and laptops are offered with many different options and styles which allows you to shop around until you find the perfect one that fits your needs and if you're feeling really tech-savvy you can buy parts and build yourself a customized ring for even cheaper another thing you'll need to consider when buying a PC is security Mac's are praised for their security and lack of spyware and viruses with fewer viruses most Mac users can get by without purchasing any virus protection windows users on the other hand will need to be ready for constant driver and security updates not to mention they'll need antivirus and spyware protection so that the computer won't become bogged down and inoperable if you don't mind staying on top of your virus software and are looking to save some cash you might want to consider a PC if you want a computer to test your programs as well as develop them Mac's have a great deal of flexibility when it comes to what operating system you run a Mac can easily run both Windows and Linux using a variety of and on the flip side windows can't easily or legally run the OS X operating system this isn't a problem if you're only looking for a machine to develop on but if you want to test your projects as well it's a good idea to have more operating systems available another great reason to pick a Mac is that it is UNIX based this means that you get a terminal that is a bash shell with all standard UNIX utilities a built-in secure shell as well as other software that's very useful for development if you want it to do this on a PC you need to download putty cygwin and PowerShell which you're just not as good as the UNIX terminal I'm starting to see a pattern here it sounds like pcs require a lot of extra software to get the job done well that might just be because pcs have more options windows offers users a huge array of applications and software ranging from media player's computer maintenance programs to video games on a PC you have an unlimited amount of choices regarding what types of software you want to use if one doesn't fit your needs you can simply find another one Mac's offer considerably fewer options for users it may have some subpar apps in certain areas windows also offers more hardware compatibility you'll find that most hardware is designed with Windows in mind and OSX as an afterthought meaning that Mac users might need to pay a bit more attention to compatibility when it comes to development both platforms are equally good for programming it really depends on what environment and language you want to use so if you're planning to work in Visual Studio and sequel server you would need to develop on a PC and if developing for OSX or iPhone is your thing a Mac is the way to go for all other cross-platform programming languages it usually doesn't matter which operating system you're programming in it's up to your personal preference when it comes down to it both machines are good for programming which you choose really depends on your main focus to really pick the machine you'll need to know which features will best benefit you as well as what you want to develop for dev I'm Erik Cormier and I'm a Mac and I'm rob dyrdek and I'm a PC happy shopping
