hi dr. mark Whitacre here with our screencast on laying out web pages using divisions so let's get started I created a web page very much like one of their previous screencast but this time I use different shades of green and outer of my alma mater Michigan State University go Spartans now the layout is exactly the same but the way to be out there is a bit different and some so let's go in and let's look at the code we are TextWrangler and you start looking at the bottom remember we said that we are using divisions so we've got one great big division here they were calling container and I've indented my line so we can find where division ID container and so all you got to do is keep going down until we see division off tags that line up okay I think you're starting to get the idea that just about everything here is contained within this division that's why we called it container you specify that it's style is a width of 500 pixels and that's the only attribute we give it besides its name then we start on the next division and we're giving this an ID of help we're saying that its style is a background color of a darker green and then we come in and we have our heading we have an h1 with a style margin bottom zero our title is the Academy and then we end the header and that ends the division and that code right there is what gets us this top green header area with the word Academy so let's go down this next section is our menu so the Division name for Division IV is menu it's style is a background color of a little bit lighter green it's height is 200 pixels but its width is only 100 pixels now I remember I told you our definition was some the menu comes after the header so be below it the whole container is 500 pixels wide but this one is only using a hundred of the pixels the first 100 from the left-hand margin leaving 400 pixels for our test okay and then we say float:left so our tax is going to float low up then we have our menu title menu we skip a couple lines and then we have our menu of course choices HTML CSS JavaScript and Perl and that ends the division so now we know what this menu area looks like and how we got there and we've only used this top header and the first 20% of the center section so the next thing that we'll be talking about is this big text area and that's the division with id content we give it a style background color which is a very very pale green we make it 200 pixels high 400 pixels wide and we float:left and then we come in with our test again after each paragraph and put it in a couple of break to the toughest separation between the text and that's the end of the division so that division created this text area on the right and the lightest grape all we've got left now is the bottom or what you might call the footer really my gosh our ideas for the table pen style color is back to the darkest of the three grains we're using very well we're lining our touch to the center and we're putting on copyright notice and what ending television that ends our container division which allows the end the body and only to end the page so that's how we would get this layout using divisions or they use divisions or tables you can accomplish a lot in laying out your web pages in different ways have fun
