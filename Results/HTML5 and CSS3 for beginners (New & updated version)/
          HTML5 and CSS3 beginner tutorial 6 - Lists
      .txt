hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 6 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about lists in HTML so taking a look at my text editor I've gone and cleared out the code from the previous tutorials and I've left some comments here because we've got ordered lists we've got unordered lists and then we've got definition lists so these are the three different types of Lists that we use in HTML and I want to show you guys an example of each one so an ordered list is obviously a list that has an order this would be a list that is numbered from 1 to however long your list is right so let me create a list of steps to take 4 steps to learning HTML something like that right now whenever you want to create an ordered list in HTML you open up something called an O L Tech which stands for ordered list so I'll hit enter and that completed the tag for me I'm going to hit enter again just to format everything nice and tidy and then inside of this Oh L tag you actually have to create another tag which is an L I tag and that stands for list item so I'm going to hit enter and now we have an ordered list with one list item in it but that list item is empty so let's think about it steps to learning HTML or what is the first thing I want to do go to YouTube maybe and then I want to duplicate this list item so if you're using sublime like I am you can hit shift command + D or shift ctrl + D and that will duplicate the line provided your cursor is in front of that line so let's do that 4 times and let's just say there's 4 steps to learning HTML go to YouTube search for Quinton what watch his videos and the last one can be practice right so let me go ahead and save this now and I want to take a look at this in my browser so I'm going to jump back over to my to Firefox and hit refresh with the my localhost open and now you can see if i zoom in I have my steps to learning HTML an ordered list that goes from 1 to 4 and all of the items that I placed in here are displaying so that is how to create an ordered list let's take a look at how to create an unordered list so I know that lists are not numbered they are or they have bullet points so obviously an unordered list is something that you don't have to follow the specific order of let's just say something like grocery a grocery list of things I need to buy today grocery list of things to buy I probably shouldn't waste my time fixing these typos but hey let me open up my unordered list by opening up a UL tag so that is how do you create an unordered list you open up a UL tag and I'm just going to hit enter so UL obviously stands for unordered list and inside of this UL tag we also make lists or make use of these list items so I'm going to create a list item and I'm going to duplicate this four times and let's think of four things that I need to buy today because it is really hot right now so I think maybe some ice for drinks maybe some iced tea because that sounds very refreshing right now hmm something without ice in it apples because they're just nice refreshing fruits and hmm something else that I need to buy today probably food so let me go ahead and save this and hit refresh in the browser and now you can see that I've got a grocery list of things to buy and this is an unordered list so all items are marked with a bullet point instead of a number and that is the main difference between an ordered list and an unordered list now let's take a look at the last type of list I want to show you guys which is a definition list so definition this actually works slightly differently to these ones you might use this if you were creating something like a dictionary or maybe a menu perhaps so let me open up my definition list by opening up a DL tag and that stands for definition list so I'm going to hit enter and inside of here we don't make use of the li item anymore we make use of two new tags one of them is ADT for definition title or definition term someone hit enter and then below the definition title we need to add another tag which is d d which is the definition description so hit enter and over here you put in like your definition term so let's say that this was a menu perhaps I might put in coffee as the definition term and then for the definition description I'll say something like black coffee with sugar right so that was one list item done or one definition term and description done let me go ahead and see this and paste this a few times and the next definition term again because it's really hot let's use something nice and refreshing like iced tea and for the description I'll just put iced tea with lemon and then the last one let's use a milkshake as an example and mmm I don't know just list the flavors vanilla chocolate or strawberry right so let me go ahead and save this and jump back over to the browser and hit refresh and now you can see we've got the definition term displaying as if it were like a title and then we have the definition description displaying as if it were like one of the list items except it doesn't have a bullet point or a number so that is how you use the three lists in HTML and we'll be taking a look at using these for other things in future but for now that is all I have for you and I'll see you next time I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I thank you hey thanks for staying until the end of the video that really means a lot to me now while you're still here there are a few things that you can do to help first of all if you haven't already subscribe and watch another one of my videos and if you want to help me make more content more often or if you feel that my content is just worth paying a little bit of money towards you can check me
