we're going to continue right where we left off in the last video and we created this disabled button and as you can see here we can't click on it now there's also another icon that you get with this and it's usually one of those no symbols and we didn't get that for this and somebody sent me an email about that and the reason is for some reason this might be a bug within bootstrap itself but the large button does not get that symbol so I'll show you what I mean so let's go ahead and copy and paste this and we'll just move right below this line here and let's go ahead and just get rid of the LG here so this will just be a medium sized button and let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page now we get that do not symbol so that's really sort of interesting and perhaps it's a bug in bootstrap I'm not sure in any event let's move on and the point of this lecture is to show you how to group buttons up so that you get sort of a menu look you can group them all together and to do that you always want to put those inside of a div so that's we're going to start out with and what this will do is sort of connect all of the buttons into one sort of single unit and you'll see how it looks when we're done with it and so again you want to wrap these into a container element or a container div and then we will go ahead and put in our buttons and we will use a bootstrap class to create that button group and you'll see that in a second okay so let's go ahead and create our div and then we're going to go ahead and call our class our bootstrap class so of course we have to use the class attribute and the class we're going to call is BTN group so we just go ahead and put that right here so this is always the class that you will call to create a button group in bootstrap it's that simple the next attribute we need is a role and for a button group you're always just going to set this to a group there is actually another role that you can set this to and that is toolbar and we'll talk about that in a future video but just remember if you're going to create a button group you just set the role to group it's pretty simple and so let's go ahead and close this div out now I have found that it's easier to use the button element rather than the input element for these button groups so we're going to go ahead and use the button element now remember I told you in the last lectures if we can use bootstrap buttons against the input element the button element the anchor element so we're just going to go ahead and use the button element okay so let's go ahead and create our first button and then of course as you recall from the last lecture we need a class and let's go ahead and we'll just pick one from up here let's take the button primary class let's go ahead and take that so we'll just copy and paste that right down here and then let's go ahead and give this a name and we're just going to call this button one and let's go ahead and add a few more buttons to our button group so we'll just copy and paste this and we'll just go down here and let's set this second one to info how about that that'll be our second button and then we'll call this one button too and just for good measure let's go ahead and add a third button to our button group and we'll just go ahead and use the success button let's go ahead and use that so we'll type that right in here good and this will be button three okay and now we just need of course to close our div out okay so let's go ahead and save this all up and let's refresh our page and take a look at that there is our button group now we don't have the margin here because I didn't create a CSS rule for that and you know what let's go ahead and just line everything up nicely here I'm kind of a perfectionist so let's go down here and we'll just go ahead and add some CSS here and we're going to work against of course our div and we're just going to give that the same margin so there we go let's save that let's go back here and refresh our page and great everything looks great so you can see this button group and see how nice this looks looks pretty nice everything's aligned very nicely you'll notice here that they round off the button on the left and the button on the right but the center one is not so this is very nicely done now this isn't the only thing you can do with button groups there are some other things you can do as well so let's go ahead and let's copy and paste all this code and let's go down here and we'll paste it back so what you can do here let's say we wanted all these buttons large large buttons instead of going into each one of these elements and doing that you can actually do it from up here you only have to specify it one time and then it will be applied all of our different buttons so let's say again we wanted to make all these buttons large you can do that with the button group class so again you just Reece Pesa fie the class and then you just put a - LG right here and this should make all of the buttons large so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and see if this works and it did take a look at this now you have three large buttons and again you only had to add this little bit of code right here we didn't have to go down and add that to all these buttons so it's always good to try and take shortcuts when you can to cut down on the amount of code that you are writing now you'll notice the default is horizontal but what if you wanted this button group to be vertical so let's go ahead and we're going to take this first group here again and we're going to copy and paste this or right down here and all we're going to do is add vertical to the end of our button - group class and this should make all the buttons appear vertical so let's go ahead and save this let's refresh our page and there you can see now these are vertical so these button group classes are very powerful in bootstrap and buttons are used in almost every type of website that had some sort of form submission so these are very important classes to use inside bootstrap we will continue on in the next video thank you
