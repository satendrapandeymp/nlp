so I want to talk about some text properties in CSS now you can see here for first paragraph currently we have text indent on this just sets up on the indent for a paragraph if this was multi-line then it would only just do it for the first line I currently set the text in it to one centimeter from the left of the screen some it's apparently proper to have an indent first for your paragraphs so text indent will come in handy another one is text align and there's multiple ways you can align your text but mainly you're going to want to use Center if you're going to want to Center the text so text align Center will Center it text-align:right will make the text go to the right and the left which is by default will make it go to the left arm another one is going to be text shadow you got to play around with this but you have to indicate the location you want it going to the right or how much you want to go to the right and how much you want it to go down and D and then the next setting is which you can put in pixels or any unit you want on the power of the blur so we're going to be to text tools to the right to pixels down and we're gonna make it strength of four pixels depan we're going to just we're going to put a red text shadow there and we'll see what happens so you can see here it's a red shadow and it's cool if I took this eight and I double that you can see it gets more blurrier so I suggest just playing around with this I want to see what happens if I do that you only if you go a little bit too far in like something might go a little bit wrong but 16 pixels and if you use four pixels by four pixels to see it'll be farther also just the two pixels sorry two pixels and you can see the less unless it is the border again so if I set it to zero it's almost again active if I set this to one pixel you can see there we go and that one step that's four pixels right there another one I want to talk about is um text transform this one's really simple what this will do is that this will just modify the entire all the text in the element the first one is capitalized so if you set it to capitalize everything all the first letters of each word is going to be capitalized and uppercase will turn everything uppercase and lowercase will make it everything lowercase so you can see that's all lowercase and another one is text decoration and there is the overnight effect which will just sew a line above the text another one is lying through so that's so that's a strikethrough and probably the most important one out of all these would be underlined so everything here will be underlined so um yeah that's pretty much it and just another thing yeah you can set the color you can set the color of your of your text as well using the color property but I've used this as an example earlier so you problem so I don't really need to tell you that but it's just something really useful but yeah um those are the text properties and thanks for watching goodbye
