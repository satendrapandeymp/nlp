hello friends welcome back in this video we're gonna learn about HTML tags elements attributes and global attributes okay so let's look at them one by one first of all we wanna learn about HTML tags so HTML tags are special keywords that are used to structure our HTML contents okay so as you can see that they have two parts first one is opening tag and second one is closing tag okay this hat is also opening tag and closing it same with the title and same with other HTML tags okay they have two parts opening but and closing parts but there are some other types such as self closing tags and empty tags okay so let's look at them what are the self closing tags well self-closing tags are simply closed by putting a forward slash inside their opening tag so let's write a self closing tag for example I am going to create a line break and I'll write BR and inside this BR tag I gonna put a forward slash now it becomes a self closing tag okay so this is more like accessible syntax but in html5 we don't have to write this forward slash we can leave it as it is okay so this will create a line break so what is the line break let's see it in action in our browser okay so now you can see that we have a space of over one line okay here I want to create a two different line inside this h1 element so I'll write beer and let's say it into our browser so you can see that by using the BR tag I have created two different lines but it will remain a single heading element okay so now let's look at another self closing tag which is HR and this is used to create a horizontal rules in our HTML documents so let's write the same thing and let's look into our browser and you can see that there's a horizontal rule created in our document now let's get back to text editor and remove this and this will work fine okay because in html5 we don't have to put this for research is there some empty tags such as input input tags you don't have to put any forward slash to close it as a self closing or voted standalone self closing tag for this input element for example I have applied button value for this type attribute inside this input element and it's a empty element again a value attribute and give it submit which will be written on our button and let's preview into our browser here you can see that we have created simple buttons okay so simply you don't have to put this forward slash or neither this closing input it's wrong way to write HTML input type okay so guys let's delete this one and now let's learn about the attributes so as I said attributes have two parts first one is name of the attribute then second one is the value for the attribute so type is the name of the attribute followed by a equal to sign and the value is the button similarly value is the attribute name and submit is the value food for that attribute okay so now let's write another attribute which is global attribute and it can be applied to almost any HTML element so let's write the title attribute and give it a title of my heading and this will be displayed when you hover over cursor to the text this is my document first first document so let's hover over your mouse cursor to this HTML h1 tags and you can see this is a tooltip displaying my heading okay so let's get back to our text editor and now write another attribute for our paragraph and this is the style attribute and left and this attribute is specially used for CSS writing your CSS so let's apply color for our paragraph and basically attributes are used for the purpose of giving some extra functionalities to our HTML elements okay so let's write color so give it a color of red and let's get back in your browser and see the color red has been applied now let's do something else let's give it a a lying off right so let's write it text-align:right so the text will be aligned to the right okay so now let's get back to our text editor and here what I wanna do I wanna explain the next thing which is the element so elements are the building blocks of our HTML documents okay so this paragraph combining two tags first one is opening tag and second one is closing tags and containing contents inside this and this forms the element paragraph element so all the elements are the building blocks of our HTML documents and these HTML elements further form the Dom which Stanford document object model which is the tree structure of our all the HTML elements such as this is the root element and it has a child element of head body and further body has its own child elements h1 element B our HR input P paragraph all these are the elements okay so now friends I hope you understand all the things that is related to HTML such as tags elements attributes global attributes etc so guys if you liked this video please hit like to this video and subscribe to my channel for learning more and if you have any suggestion or feedbacks please comment below in comment section ok so see you in next video bye bye Takia
