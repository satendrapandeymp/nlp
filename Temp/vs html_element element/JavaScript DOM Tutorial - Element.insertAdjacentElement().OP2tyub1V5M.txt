hey guys hey gone my name is DOM and today I want to talk about the insert adjacent element method inside the JavaScript document object model so essentially this method right here allows you to insert a new HTML element that is adjacent to another element so it actually works very similar to the appendchild and the insert before methods where lets you actually insert a new element so it's probably easier to demonstrate this with an example so I've got this HTML document right here and we're gonna actually create a new div which is a large black area and then use the insert adjacent HTML sorry insert adjacent element the method to actually insert a new element inside this div and also outside of this div so inside the source code for this document let's begin by creating a new div and giving it an ID of area okay so div ID of area inside here we can make a new h2 tag and put some text inside there okay so now if I was to save this and refresh the browser we get this look right here so we're gonna actually make this div have a large black background and what text so back inside here let's just go inside the CSS for this document and target the ID of area and set the background color as being black the color as being what and the padding as being 25 here so this is just for visual purposes so now I can save this and refresh and we get this one right here so we're going to insert a red div in one of four positions using this insert adjacent element method so I'm going to insert it before the div as a first child of the div as a last child of the doof and also after the div finishes so inside the source code I've actually written down a few positions and these positions right here actually passed into the insert adjacent element method okay so what I'll do first though is actually just target a new ID inside the CSS just to actually create the red box so you know to call this idea of box right there and give it some padding of something like again 25 px and a and a background color this time being red okay so now I'm going to create this dude for the ID of box using javascript and then we're going to use this method right here to actually add it to the to the document object model okay so inside the JavaScript let's just first get a reference to this ID of area so let's make a new constant down here and we'll call this one area equal to document dot get element by ID we're gonna pass in area right there so now we have a reference to the actual different idea of area okay so below here we're going to now create the red box element so let's make a new constant core this one box equal to document dot creates element okay gonna create a new div all right so we have that right there and now we're gonna just say box dot class list dot add sorry not class this so box ID equals and then box so now we had a div with an ID of box so now this class will be targeted or this class would sorry this CSS rule set will target that box right there okay so now we can finally use the insert adjacent HT so element method okay so down here let's say area so targeting the actual black box dot insert adjacent elements okay this takes senior two arguments the first one being the position of where to place the element so we have four options right here as previously mentioned so let's just say for now before begin and this will insert it before the actual black box has began okay so as the second argument we pass in the element to add some I pass in box right there it's a now house to save this and refresh the browser now we see we get that box right there so I'm not sure what padding for this one but anyway we can see that the the red box gets added before the black box begins maybe I should actually add some margin just below the the box so let's just say margin bottom as 10px save and refresh now we can see that the red box gets added before the div ID area begins so now this ID our box is a child of the body and not the actual area black div okay so that is how you can use the before begin position so if I was to say after begin inside here instead I can save this and refresh this time we get the box inside inside the area div as a first child okay so before that child right there okay so if I was to change this now to the before ends this one refresh this time we get the the red box below as the last child of the area div okay and finally the after ends our position right there this time we see the box appears below the actual area black dude okay so that what there is how you can use the insert adjacent element method inside the JavaScript document object model thanks for watching and I'll see you later
