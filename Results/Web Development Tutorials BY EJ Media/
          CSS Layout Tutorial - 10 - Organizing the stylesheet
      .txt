welcome to the 10th video on CSS layouts in this video we're going to take a little bit of time and organize our stylesheet we're going to talk about that because our CSS stylesheet is starting to get larger and larger and it's important to get control of your code before it dominates you and the primary objective is to be able to find rulesets quickly and easily and if we just keep adding massive rule sets all the way down it'll be harder and harder to find things so it's important early on to get control of your code and organize it in a meaningful manner and then you won't pay the price later on when potentially you could have thousands of lines of CSS code so what I like to do is use comments comments are your best friend in the coding world and in CSS we create a comment by using forward slashes so the first part of the comments section needs to have a forward slash and a wildcard behind it the end of the comments section needs to have a wildcard in front of the forward slash and so the browser will not read this you can put anything in here that you like and what I like to do is put a bunch of equal signs and then in caps right in layout section and then we'll put a few more equal signs as many as you want and there there we go and so this clearly tells me that everything below this is my layout section and that's what we've been working on so this is the body this is the header and so that makes sense now let's go ahead and copy this and we'll paste this down here now remember the footer is the end of our website this was kind of the last section that we had so let's go ahead and put in another set of comments here and we're going to call this headings section this tells me that all of my styling for my headings is in this section and this is a nice break and keep in mind headings could go anywhere in your web page so it's not really in a logical manner like our layout section is we can put these in any area of our web page so I like to always have a different heading section now in the next video we're actually going to get started on buttons so we'll make a button section and eventually we'll do CSS animation so we'll make an animation section so it's just important to kind of divvy up your code in a meaningful way now you don't have to necessarily do it this way this is the way I like to do this but again you can develop your own strategy some developers will actually create a table of contents up here and then organize it in that way now I should also point out that this can cover multiple lines so you know I could make multiple lines in here you can put as many different lines as you want in between these two forward slashes so just keep in mind that's something you can do now another useful thing with comments is to actually put them in the rule sets so let's go ahead and we'll just copy and paste this again and let's say that for instance we weren't sure if we wanted our font size at 14 or 15 pixels so we could actually you know let's say we were kind of undecided but we wanted to go with 14 pixels but we also wanted to keep a rule in here with 15 pixels and so now we could save this we could keep this here but and in case we wanted to use this at a later period we could simply just uncomment this out and put comments around this one and then we would have 15 pixels being set in our body you can also use this for you know any type of rule so that's a good way to remember different types of rules that you made without having to use them necessarily now in terms of this strategy you can also keep different hex codes in here I do that sometimes so I'll actually store a bunch of different colors in the comment area in a particular section and play around with those colors so I don't have to go look them back up I'll keep the bunch of colors down here and then you can kind of toggle them as you see fit so that's also useful okay let's so let's open up our web page and I'll just show you that those comments did not affect our page in any way and there you can see we're still good to go so that's going to do it for this video in the next video we're going to work on the navbar and we're going to add buttons so we will do a whole series on buttons see you guys in
