hey YouTube how's it goin it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 41 and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about styling forms so yeah if we take a look at this in our browser real quick I just want to show you all the code I'm working with so if you take a look at this in the browser we've got one submit button that is visible and that's the only thing that's visible and maybe I should zoom in a little bit so you can see that a little bit more clearly alright then if we take a look at the text editor this is the code I'm using for this tutorial basically code that I borrowed from all the other tutorials so if you've been following along with the tutorial that's good alright so it's just a form and then an input of type submit' and in our CSS file we have absolutely nothing right if you want to download this code it is of it available for download on patreon you just got a pledge $1 you don't actually have to pay the dollar just pledge $1 and you'll be able to download the code and then you can on pledge later on although I would really like it if you did keep that pledge going right so now that we've gone all of that all the way let's take a look at actually how to style this button so the thing with input types is because input elements have this attribute called type which changes how they look you can't just select an input element in CSS the same way that we've selected other elements before right so if you want to style this input of type submit' you got to select it a little bit differently you can't just type in input and think okay I'm going to select that input button right because sometimes you have input types of text or input type of number and all of those look a little bit different so in this case what we want to what we want to do is add in some square brackets so these are not curly braces these are square brackets we'll add in the curly braces after that and then inside of the square brackets you want to go ahead and say type is equal to add some quotation marks in there and inside these quotation marks is where you put the type of the element that you want to select which in this case we want to select this input type of Submit so let's go ahead and grab that and place that in here right and now we should be styling submit buttons on our page and the way to test that is to just go ahead and add a background and set that equal to not submit have fly cuts over here which keeps record of things that I've copied and pasted recently ok so now we have input type of submit with a background color of this should be red and if we save this now and come back over the browser and refresh you can see I now have a reddish kind of submit button problem is if you take an even closer look there is this gray border going around our button and that doesn't look very good so I kind of want to get rid of that right and the way we get rid of that is just by sitting border to 0 pixels so yeah if you ever want a button that looks kind of flat you're going to want to get rid of that border and that should make our button look a little bit better but there are still a few more things that we can do to actually make this button look much better all right so one of those things is to maybe just add a little bit of padding and you want to add some padding to the top and the bottom and then some padding to the left and the right but you want more padding on the left and the right usually because you want the button to be more rectangular right so I'm going to add 5 pixels to the top on the bottom and 20 pixels to the left and to the right and that should leave us with a nice big submit button if i zoom out back to 100% that's pretty much what it should look like in your browser another thing you might notice is black text on a dark red button is not very easy to see so you might want to just change the color of the text with the color property to hash FFF and that'll make it white so you have light text dark background much more convenient right so let's come back and refresh and there we go that's a lot more readable right so that is the submit button and something a quick little tip I want to give you guys is that if you ever have more than one button in your form like you might have an input type of button or a button just like the button tag you might want to copy this code and apply it to more than one element at a time and the way you do that is by just taking that selector right and after that adding a comma and then adding your next selector so this this comma over here is very very important don't forget about that and then input type let's select input type of button and then we can go ahead and also just select anything that has a button tag and what that does is then just apply all the same styling to any one of those elements right so now I can take this input type of submit copy and paste that just add it or change the type to button and we can just change the text to something else like button and when you refresh that you now have a button and a submit button they look pretty much identical and that's because we've given them the exact same styling over here but input of type button is a little bit different to an input type of submit an input type of submit we'll submit our form where as an input type of button if you use JavaScript you can make it do some cool stuff without actually submitting the form so these things are used in two different places for most for most of us will probably only use the submit button so yeah let's just not get too far ahead of ourselves by asking questions about that next one I just want to be show you the styling okay so now that we've got all of that out of the way let's take a look at actually styling other input elements so input of typed text is the next kind of element that we're going to work with quite a lot and I'm going to give that a name equal to name and an ID equal you name and I should probably just put a label in front of here as well so let's open up the label tag and say name and the reason why I gave this an ID is because when you use the four attributes in a label if you take the exact same thing that was in the ID and paste that in the four attribute for the label yeah when you click on the label it selects the input right click on the label and it's going to select the input so something I'd really like to do right now is make our button and the input more or less the same height or just style them a little bit better so right now they're actually pretty close but I think what happens if I change my button to be a little bit bigger so let's make my button ten pixels on the top on the bottom now you can see the button is quite a lot bigger than the text element so we might want to change that and have them match a little bit so you can select input of type is equal to text and basically style that to have a padding of I'm a few pixels as well this is something you're going to have to play by eye because they're not always they don't always appear to be exactly the same height like if you zoom into that a little bit you can see the button is definitely bigger than the input right so sometimes what I like to do is just give that a height and I set that equal to well I set that equal to whatever the button actually lands up being so in this case if I inspect elements and I go to layout in my element inspector the button has ten pixels plus ten pixels plus thirteen so that should be 33 so that means I can give this text element of their a height of 33 by going back over to my input my styling rule just saying height 33 pixels right just come back here and refresh and not quite right and I think that's because the padding so yeah this is just something that you have to play around with it that sometimes is a little bit tricky but that's when I using something like Firebug in Firefox is quite handy because it gives you these little rulers and that kind of stuff so yeah anyway okay so anyway I just went ahead and change that value I find that a height of 25 if I'm not going to add any padding or anything to this kind of suits the elements so height of 25 works I'm going to leave that as it is and like I said it's just something you might want to play around with a little bit by eye and what we can do to maybe make this form look a little bit better is add in a few break tags you know if the forms going to get a little bit longer can add in a few breakdowns or something just to put the button on a different line to our elements and there's actually a lot more stuff that you can do with forms if you want to really control the layout but this tutorials going to get kind of long so I'm going to move on to adding different widths and stuff like that in the next tutorial so I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS
