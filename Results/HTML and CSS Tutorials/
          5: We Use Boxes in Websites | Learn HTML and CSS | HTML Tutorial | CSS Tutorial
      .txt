today we're going to learn about containers inside HTML and the reason I want to spend one episode talking about containers is because usually we'll make a website we split all the content into boxes and this is something that we can kinda tell on a lot of websites so I thought today we're going to talk about you know how we split up the content inside websites so I'm going to go ahead and go into my browser here and I did actually find three websites that we're going to look at just so you guys can see what I talk about when I talk about containers because it was to look at the website I have here which is just my basic website that just has a piece of text inside of it you guys can see we can't really tell that anything is inside boxes so let's actually going to take a look at three random examples that I've found and the first one is something called night people now inside this website here you guys can kind of tell that we have a bunch of content we have a logo we have a navigation we have a logged in and then we have some content down on the page here now one thing I want you guys to pay attention to is that when we go to a website we can kind of divide all the content into boxes now right now we were to take a look at this website at least the front page when we enter the website for the first time you guys can see we have an entire video playing in the background here with some content inside the video now we can actually do is we can actually go and say that well we have one big box here with a video net and inside this box here we have more boxes so we have one box for the header which is the part up here with the navigation and logo and the login buttons all of these are inside one box that are grouped together so we can actually have content that goes together inside a box for themselves then we have some text down here that says we unite construction business blah blah blah which is also going to be inside a separate box for self so everything inside a website is inside boxes if were to scroll down you guys can see that the box with the video and it actually disappears and we have another box that has our sectors inside of it so we have an entire box here that has a white background with another box inside of it that has content such as a header has a piece of text and four different links inside of it so if we keep scrolling down you guys can also see we have a map this is also a box that has a map inside of it and we have a sidebar in the left side which is also a box that has content inside of it so everything inside the website is made out of boxes it would take the next example here you guys can see we have a hit at the top here now it's a bit more clear to see that we do have a box inside at the top of the website here so we have a logo we have a navigation and the login button and all of this is inside a very white box that has all the content if we were to go a bit further down you guys can see that a video with a bit of content on the right side here which is also inside a box inside this box that contains the video so again everything is inside boxes so all these websites here that I'm looking at even though they might seem complicated all the content are going to be put inside boxes so if I were to go inside the code of my website here you guys consider right now we don't actually have any boxes inside the code right now meters have a paragraph and the way we can create boxes inside our code is either using HTML elements which we talked about in the previous episode for example if you have a article which right now is actually a box that does not have a purpose inside the browser so an article would actually have related content inside of it so article does have a specific purpose for which content should go inside of it inside our website now if I want to create a box that has no purpose inside the website that I can just use any place that I want to group content together such as the paragraph down here and maybe if I were to create a h2 tag that has this is the title and then the paragraph then is going to be you know whatever text belongs to the title if we want to group this together inside a box so I can move around the content using styling which we're going to talk about in the next episode because notes actually tell the browser where we want the content we need to style our code inside the website so right now it would just save this you guys can see that the text is just going to be up in the corner and if I want to move it around such as centering it or changing the text or doesn't look this boring to do it using CSS and we call that styling the HTML so we're not going to talk about that yet we're going to do that in the next episode but if we were to put this inside a box I can actually go ahead and create something cold and div now it's div like I said it's just an empty element and I can actually go ahead and take my tags here and put them inside the div so right now we have this grouped inside a box and we can actually go ahead if I want to move around the h2 tag and the paragraph inside the website I can just go ahead and style the div tag here with like I said we do using CSS in order to move around the content inside of it so if I were to go back inside one of the websites we looked at for example you could say humankind's I can go ahead and scroll down into some section and set the website such as this one you guys can see you have some content on the left side and we have some content on the right side if I want to take a look at what we do actually have inside the website I can actually go ahead and right-click which is a small trick that I can actually show you guys no to see the code of any kind of website and this is not something that you can block anyone can go to your website and see the code at least the front-end code that we code using HTML CSS so in order to see this code we can right click on the website for example want to see the code of this specific section here I can right click on it go to inspect and then you guys can see we get this small window here with code inside of it and this is actually the code inside the actual website at least when it comes to the front end part so what I can do here as you guys can see when I hover on these different sections inside the code is that it does actually highlight the code or at least the constant that I hover on inside the code so we want to see that as well as you guys can see this specific section here with the two different constants you guys can see that everything is inside one box if I were to go inside this div here which you guys can actually see this is actually the tip box that I showed you guys so what to go inside of it inside my tool here we can actually see that this content in here is split up into more boxes so we have the left box and if we were to go here we have the right box so we can actually see what is actually going on inside the front end code when we use this developer tool inside any kind of browser so as we continue this course you I'm actually going to show you guys how we're going to use these boxes such as dip box or some of the other HTML elements inside our website so we can actually split up the content inside these boxes that I'm talking about so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time
