today we're going to learn how to create comments inside of HTML and CSS and the reason what to do this is because sometimes if were to create a lot of code inside your website it can be kind of tough to know what is what inside the code if you do not create small comments for yourself so you can actually see what the specific code does so let's actually go ahead and take a look at our front page here which is our HTML file and inside the body tags you guys can see that I have an h2 tag and I have a paragraph tag now what I can do if I want to create a comment inside HTML is that I can go ahead and go until by h2 tag and I can say less then exclamation mark - - and now you guys can see everything after the comment tag here turned gray and that's because right now all of this down here after the comment tag is a comment so what I can do is I can actually go out and say we want to create a comment that says this is the main content and then I can close off the comment tag by saying gasps - greater than so right now as you guys can see we just closed off the comment tag and right now the only comment is going to be the text in between the tags so now we talked about how to create a comment inside HTML but what about inside CSS so four words are going to set my style sheet which is up here you guys consider to have a bunch of code inside the file here which is because in the previous episode we talked about something called a reset style sheet so a bunch of this code here is actually not my code it's actually some code that we need to have before we start up a website so I want to tell by commenting where my code starts inside this file here so at the top here we do actually have the reset styling so were to scroll down to where my code starts which is right about here then I can go afterwards here and say that I want to create a comment by saying forward slash and then the star symbol or the multiplication symbol then I can go ahead and say my code just to kind of illustrate this is my code then I can say star symbol forward slash and now we ended off the comment as well so this is basic 101 - sir guys when it comes to commenting inside HTML CSS which is in fact really important to do when you create big projects if you don't create comments you can't follow which code does what inside the website so it's really important that you note down what code does what so this is basically what I wanted to show you guys today I hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time
