okay so we've been looking at the bootstrap grid over the last several videos now one question that a lot of people have is can I move columns to an exact spot where I want them can I place them in an exact position and bootstrap gives you a very nice class that has that type of functionality and so that's what we're going to cover in this video and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and get rid of columns 7 6 & 5 this of course is in our second row so we're gonna go ahead and get rid of those and we're going to go ahead and keep our fourth column in our second row so let's save this let's reload this up and see what we get and there we go we've got our column four still and the rest of the columns are now gone so what we want to do is move this column all the way to the right and so we'll just go ahead and keep this web page loaded and we'll keep refreshing so I can show you how this works now what happens is the class that bootstrap provides always moves from left to right so when you play around with these values just keep in mind that it will always move the column from left to right in this direction so let's go ahead and we're just gonna minimize a page we're gonna flip back to our code so here is where we are going to place our class that will allow us to move our column and we're actually gonna put it right between these quotes so the first thing we do is type in Co L then a hyphen then MD then another - and here's where it gets a little bit different now you're going to type in offset so that is the standard format that we use and this is sort of similar to the normal column class now we just put in a number and this number equates to how far you're going to go ahead and push your column so let's go ahead and we'll start out with a 5 so let's go ahead and save this and let's go back to our web page and let's go ahead and hit refresh and there you can see it moved it right to the middle so if you wanted it right there you could certainly keep that number but again we want to move this all the way to the right now again you have to play around with these numbers kind of the same way you have to with the normal column class play around with the numbers until you get the exact position that you want so let's go ahead and minimize this and let's go ahead and I believe it was a 9 I was actually testing this the other night let's go ahead and save this let's open our back up and we'll hit refresh and there you can see look at that it pushed it all the way to the right so again this is a very useful class that you can use in bootstrap
