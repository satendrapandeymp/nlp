hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 26 and in this tutorial we are gonna take a look at how to style lists in HTML so if you take a look at my text editor over here I've gone ahead and just pre-populated a little bit of code so we've got an h2 that says this is a or here's a list to style and then I've got a bunch of list items within a unordered list and each one of them actually has instructions of what we're gonna do in this tutorial and then if we take a look at my main CSS file that's empty so looking at this in the browser this is pretty much what our page looks like in fact let me just zoom in to make this a little bit bigger and clearer for everyone right so here's a list style and here's some things that we can do this list we can change the list styling from circles to squares or another shape we can also make this unordered list into an ordered list so right now it uses bullet points but we could actually make this list use numbers as if it were an ordered list even though it's not an ordered list it's an unordered this ul right then we can add an image so instead of using numbers or instead of using a shape like these bullets we can actually use an image and then the last thing we can do is actually just remove the styling completely so I'm going to show you guys how to do all of that in this tutorial so let's jump over to my CSS file because that's where the meat of this tutorial is gonna be and I want to select this list by just going ahead and selecting ul and that is going to select our unordered list and then I'm gonna use a property called list style type and then I'm going to change this from right now the default setting is actually disc that's what these little colored in bullet points are actually but I'm gonna change this to a circle alright so if I change that to circle come back and hit refresh you can see that we now have Mt holes are bullet points and there are a bunch of other settings for this so you can actually just Google this and find a bunch of different options to decide which one you want to use right but the circle there is a square so stay with us come back here hit refresh now we've got little squeeze and like I said the default one is disk so if you set that back to disk it goes back to those colored in circles and there's a whole bunch of different options so go ahead google it find out what options there are I'm just showing you guys more or less how to do this not every single option that there is right okay so I'm gonna go ahead and comment this line of text out now and let's take a look at the second point wishes to make this unordered list into an ordered list so that's something we can do as well and let's just change it to circle and we can actually use the same property so I'm gonna just paste that down here I know if somebody's probably gonna ask why I just commented this out and then use the same line it's because when I make the tutorial code downloadable later on I actually want this there right so now we've got a list style type is equal to circle but let's change that from circle let's set it equal to decimal so decimal numbers of course you guys know are the numbers 1 2 3 4 that kind of stuff so if we come back here and hit refresh we now have our unordered list displaying as if it were an ordered list we've got the numbers 1 2 3 and 4 in front of each bullet point right so that's something we can do as an ordered turn our unordered list into an ordered list we can do the same thing as well if if we change this from ul - oh L then by default it would be a numbered list right but we can then go back to our code and actually change ordered lists into unordered lists by doing the same thing list-style-type and then just sitting that to square or disc or something and come back here and hit refresh and now we've changed an ordered list into an unordered list so you can do things both ways it's it's interchangeable right so I'm just gonna comment that part out as well and let's change this back to a unordered list right so the other options that we have here are refresh this again okay so the other options that we have instead of decimal there are also things like decimal - leading zero and that'll put zero in front of the number so now it's a 1 o 2 O 3 right then we can also do Roman numerals so I forget the setting for that it's Roman lo ok Papa Lewin upper upper Roman and lower Roman right so come back here and now we've got lower Roman numerals as in III III IV right you can also do it as upper Roma a proven I don't know why I'm struggling to say that Oh as a weird laughs as well okay come back hit refresh and now I've got upper Roman numerals and like I said there's a bunch of different options here so you can go ahead and Google these find out what they are I mean there's things like Greek lower Greek there are Japanese symbols like katakana so I mean you decide if you want to use something like that and just do the research right okay so that was changing the that was the second point which was making an unordered list into an ordered list we can also add a list style image instead of using Roman numerals or instead of using bullet points right so if we take a look at my htdocs folder over here obviously I've got my index file that we've been using this whole time I've got my CSS which is in there but I've also added an emoji which is the sunglasses emoji that cool emoji and yeah we can actually use something like this as a style item as well so the name of this emoji is emoji dot ping so let me copy that and I'm gonna comment that line of code out there and instead of using that lets let's use a new line which is gonna be list style image so it's a new property as well and I'm gonna set this equal to URL open my brackets and this is how you set an image for your your list item now we have to get the correct file path over here so my CSS file is here which means I need to go back one folder and then I need to go into this emoji or I need to select this emoji image so how do we go back one folder we go dot dot slash that's going to take us back one folder and then I'm gonna put the emoji or the image name in here which is emoji dot ping because it is a ping image if it is not a ping image of course then use jpg or whatever file extension your image actually is please don't just copy me when you have a different file type okay let's come back here and hit refresh and now you can see we've got our list item showing up with images in front of each list item you know it does look a little bit not nice because the image and the text don't exactly line up so they are some styling rules that you can go about there are some things that you can go about doing to fix this one of those might be to just add a little bit of extra padding in front of our list item so to be honest we might have to do okay well actually ul padding left let's just make that a little bit bigger like 50 pixels by default I think it's like 20 or 15 or so thing okay refresh fifty pixels and now we got a little bit more space here the actual image shows in the browser then you might want to just line this text and the actual picture up by adding some margin or padding on the bottom as well so yeah I don't want to spend too much time on this because it's gonna add a lot of minutes to my tutorial but just know that you might want to just add some padding or margin or something to the bottom or the tops of these things and you can get them in line right right so that was this style image let's take a look at loops let's take a look at the fourth point which is to remove all of the styling completely so if I comment this out as well right we should come back to a normal default list but we can remove the styling of these these list items by saying list-style-type:none and that's going to completely get rid of all these list items or these bullet points right but you'll see there's still a little bit of padding here so it's not exactly lined up against the edge of the website or against the edge of the browser so what we can do as well as go padding padding left the reason why I always select padding left is because while this is the left of our list and if you actually take a look at this in the browser or in the console if I hover over my unordered list you can see that purple block next to the text that's padding so if I make that smaller or if I set that to zero pixels like I'm gonna do now zero pixels then it disappears and now everything is in line right but by default that padding is pretty much always the to make space for the list or the bullet points that that appear or the images that you want to use or something like that right I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they'll teach
