hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we created this HTML form and this is a source code for it in this video tutorial I am going to discuss new html5 form controls so let's get started and get some idea I go down here to the field set advanced inputs then I create one new paragraph opening paragraph tag and closing paragraph tags in between I am going to create a label for equal to email id here I say email id closing label I create here input type equal to text name equal to double quotation ID equal to double quotation and value equal to double quotation close I am going to copy this for value paste it in name value and ID value file save go to browser and refresh can see that a text box got created there user can enter email id like something ma SS mass 4 5 6 double eight at the rate gmail.com and this is an email id okay no problem if user enters some random text and submit still the form is getting submitted this is not an email id right so to control the value in hedge tml 5 we have a type called as email so this input control is now email control file save go to browser and refresh this time you can see if I enter some random text and try to submit it gives me an error message like please include and at the rate in the email so if I say proper email id like mass 4 5 6 double eight at the rate gmail.com and say submit now the form will get submit if the email ID is not proper then if we try to submit the form the form will not get submit that is the email control operation this is how the email control works so this is a new HTML 5 control for getting the email input from the user in proper way I create one more paragraph opening paragraph closing paragraph here I create a label for URL block so here we get the user blog URL closing label and then I peer input type equal to text name equal to double quotation ID equal to double quotation value equal to nothing at present and I'm going to copy this for value and paste it as a value of name and value of ID file save go to browser and refresh can see that we have one more text box this text box is meant for adding the URL of some blog or something like that so here we are actually expecting the blog link of the user whoever fills this form if we enter some random text and submit still the form is getting submitted because this is a normal text box but in history ml5 we have a control for URL itself so type equal to URL file save go to browser and refresh and if I try to enter some some random text and if I click on submit it won't accept it tells that please enter the URL so here I can enter the URL for example HTTP colon double forward slash www dot blog spot.com as ma and Ju n-ath chid re manjunath Childre if i submit this time the form will get submit because this is a proper URL here I create one more paragraph I am going to create a label for date of birth closing label and now we are going to accept from the user his date of birth here I create an input hi NPO T input type equal to text name equal to M T ID equal to M T value equal to empty clothes and I am going to copy the value of 4 as a value of name and value of ID file save go to browser and refresh you can see one more text box got created and in this user should enter the date of birth he can enter some random text and submit that text also will get submitted but in html5 one more control is created that is actually date type equal to date if I set file save go to browser and refresh you can see it is showing now mmddyy why it is telling that user has to enter here month date and year properly or otherwise he can click and select the year here you can select maybe 1984 July 18th so that's the date of birth we can select so my date of birth is 19 I'm searching for it so 1986 July 22nd now if I click on submit the content will get submit if user enters some random text it won't accept only that is how the date control is created it's quite easy next I am going to create one more paragraph closing paragraph and here I create a label for color like so we can ask a question what color you like I am asking to user that what color he like and I want to accept that color input type equal to color name equal to M T ID equal to M T value equal to M T Flo and this color like for value I paste it in name and ID file save go to browser and refresh you can see that we got a box if I click on that I can choose a color from this list and say ok that color will be filled and I can access the value the hexadecimal value it is going to return in JavaScript we can take and use it that is how we create a color picker in the HTML form similarly I can create one more paragraph closing paragraph la be a label for F resuming I can ask user to upload his resume a close la ve a label and here I say input type equal to file name equal to empty ID equal to M T value equal to M T close I'm going to take this for value and paste it in named ion ID value file save good browser and refresh you can see that it is giving me a button which I can click and locate a file and upload it you can see that it is telling html5 form dot dot HTML when I click on submit this file is going to be submitted and we need to use scripting to perform the operation on this file or store it on the server these are the new few html5 controls I am discussing and how do we create I hope you guys are understanding how do we create email id control how do we create URL control createdate control how do we create color control how do we create file upload control and how they behave also there are some more html5 controls are there like you can create a search box by using type equal to search you can create a you can accept from a user a telephone number by a type II using type equal to tell value there are many controls are there like you can accept a value in a range I suggest you people to have a look over few more html5 controls like search box number
