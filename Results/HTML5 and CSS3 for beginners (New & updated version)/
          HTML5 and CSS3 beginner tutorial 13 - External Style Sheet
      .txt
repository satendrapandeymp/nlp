hey YouTube how's it going it's Quinton here and welcome to tutorial number 13 and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about external stylesheets but before we move on to external stylesheets I just want to do a quick catch up with you on the previous tutorial so in the previous tutorial I told you guys that there were three different ways to add CSS to your website the first way I showed you guys was an inline style attribute or an inline style rule that's what this is called and this is when you add a style attribute to your tag and then you select whatever property you want to change about your element so in this case we wanted to change the color so the thing you want to change is called a property and then I set that equal to blue which is the value so property and value those are two technical terms that you should always keep in mind then we also change the font family which was a property and we set that equal to Helvetica which was a value right so that then changed our paragraph to blue so let me just zoom in so you guys can see all clearly but that changed the value of all the properties of this first paragraph to be Helvetica and for the color to be blue right then I also showed you guys and style tags which we put in the head of our document now you could actually put these style tags anywhere on your page although it is generally accepted that if you're going to be using style tags we're going to put them up in the head of the document and then the advantage of using style tags over inline styling is that you can style more than one element at a time so over here you know if I wanted to style both my paragraphs I'd have to copy and paste the style rule and I'd have to place that in here had another paragraph I'd have to copy and paste that on to the next paragraph whereas if I wanted to be able to style all paragraphs on my website with one styling rule I could do that by just adding style tags up at the top of the page and then I select all paragraphs with a selector so that's what this thing is called and you know if I wanted to select my body then I could go up here and use a selector for the body but in this case we wanted to style all paragraphs so we're using the paragraph selector and from there we open up some curly braces and we place properties and values and that is how we style all elements on one page but if we want to style more than one page at a time let's say I've got 10 pages on my website I then have to copy and paste this code across 10 pages which you know isn't very efficient it says especially now if you want to change some styling now you've got a copy paste this code across 10 different pages every time you make a change so we have something else called a style sheet or an external style sheet which is when you add another file called a CSS file to your your what's the word directory right so right now I've got my htdocs directory and I only have an index.html file but I want to make a CSS file over here so I'm going to on Windows you can probably right-click and say new file I don't have that here so I'm going to use sublime I'm going to say file save or actually I want to say save I want to say file a new file thinking about something else entirely okay so now we've got an untitled file over here and I'm going to say file save as and then I'm going to set to name my file so you could name it absolutely anything you wanted but I'm going to name mine May dot CSS now the dot CSS part is important because that's going to tell the computer that this is a CSS file if this isn't a CSS file it's not going to work so let's hit save and now we have a blank CSS file over here and we need to link to it in this document so I'm going to remove our internal style tags and I'm going to replace that with a link so I'm going to type link as a tag and you can see it's order or already auto completed some fields for me so rel is an attribute that tells the browser that this is a style sheet now this is very important because if you do not have this tag your Styles sheet is not going to work it's not going to style your your elements when you get around to styling right so this is very very important type tells the browser that this is a CSS file but honestly if you didn't have this here it would work it's just that by standards you should always declare the type so that's why that is there right and then H riff is it works the same way as the links href works we need to tell the browser where to look for our CSS file so our CSS file if I go over to my htdocs folder over here my index file and my CSS file are in the exact same location which means that all I need to do is type the file name which is main dot CSS had I you know try to be a little bit tidy and created a folder called CSS and then put all my CSS inside a folder which is technically what we do in the real world you know we usually have a folder called CSS and then we usually take that CSS and place it in the folder then we'd usually have to then we have to declare the folder which is CSS and that forward slash means that this is a CSS folder and then main CSS so let's save this now and this should still work so if I start styling or typing some styling in the CSS we should see that affect our page and right now seeing as I've removed the style tag up here if i refresh this page we lose the styling right because we don't have that style rule anymore that says hey kernel paragraphs read so let's add that back in but I'm going to add it in in our external stylesheet so I'm going to grab this selector which is our paragraph and then I'm going to open up curly braces and then I'm going to type color that is our property I'm going to set a value for this and let's set that equal to now let's use red because yellow is not going to be visible so let me save this come back here and hit refresh and you can see something is not working have I saved this let's see you refresh okay that is still working CSS main CSS dead I main dot CSS main dot CSS it's in a folder called CSS is it oh that's confusing replace okay so what happened here was I'm saving this every time I hit save do you see it added the CSS file back here so let me just close this and you know I'm going to delete that one because that's confusing us and let's grab the one that's actually in the folder oh that wasn't supposed to be lead it grabbed the one that's actually in the folder and place it over here so was my bad I confused sublime over there but let's come back here and refresh and now I have my styling rule affecting the text on my my websites we changed this paragraph to blue and we might as well just change the font family as well to hell fatica man I spelled it wrong didn't I good oops Helvetica copy that paste it in here save come back to the browser hit refresh and now it is L Vertica so that is how you use an external stylesheet and like I said the advantage for that is that now let's say you have 10 different web's web pages on your website all you need to do is copy and paste this link across all the different pages and then you only need a type all your styling in your main CSS file once and it updates across all 10 pages so work smarter not harder and I'll see you guys in the next video I just want to send a shout out to my sponsors at dev Mountain they run a coding bootcamp with courses on iOS development UX design and web development and they can teach you everything you need to know to get a job within this field and they'll do it within 12 weeks which i think is a rather impressive timeline so go ahead and check out their website the link is in the video description and if you do contact them make sure to tell them that I
