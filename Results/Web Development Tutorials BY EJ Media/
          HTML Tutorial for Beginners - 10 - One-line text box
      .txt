in this video we're going to take an initial look at HTML forms and forms are something we use a lot when we're on websites they are used to collect information and so you might have filled out a contact information form on a website and when you submit that it's handled by a web server so we're not going to handle that part of it that's for a future video but in these next few videos we're going to talk about the actual input fields that's what we're going to create with HTML now it all starts with the form element tag you can see that right here we have the opening tag we have the closing tag now by itself the form element tag doesn't do anything it just declares in HTML that this is a form that we're going to submit and you can see here though we have a blank web page nothing in there because again the form element tag by itself doesn't do anything we have to put our input elements inside the form element that's why I put this comment right here input elements go in here so the first thing we're going to do in this video is create one of the most common input elements and that is the one line text box and you've seen that many many times when you filled out information on a website so I'll just copy and paste the first line here and so here we go we actually have a text box right here and that is used by the input element tag so I've created that notice we don't need a closing tag because it's just an element that goes inside the parent form element so that's the way it works now the key to this is to understand this attribute right here type equals text this text denotes that this will be a one line text box that's what's going to be rendered when we refresh this page in a few minutes now I don't want you to worry about these three attributes the action attribute the method attribute and the name attribute we will talk about this in a future series in a JavaScript and in a PHP series because these have to do with the server-side of this and that's not what we're going to talk about in this HTML series we are only interested in creating a text box in this series with HTML we are not interested in server-side code at this point so don't worry about those attributes right now so let's go ahead and refresh our page now and there you can see we've got our one line text box is now cool and we can create another one let's go ahead and create a second one here you can create as many as you want and we'll hit save here well refresh and there you see we've got two now if you don't want these side-by-side we can just put in a break tag which we've seen before and we'll hit refresh and there you can see now they're in a top-down order and you'll notice that when we click on the actual control this is called the control by the way the actual one-line text box though very few people call it a control they usually just call it a one-line text box but when we click on the control it is highlighted in the browser now let's say you want to change the length of this box on your page let's say it's not wide enough to contain all of the information that you want the user to enter well it will automatically scroll to a lot more letters but what if you want this to be wider so people don't have to use a scroll bar we can accomplish that by the size attribute so let's go ahead and put that in right here and we'll say size equals and we'll say 100 characters and we'll leave this bottom textbox alone so let's go ahead and refresh this and let's see what we get and you can see how much lighter this is now in fact let's lower that to a more reasonable amount how about 50 characters and there you can see it's now much wider if you need a lot more information to gather here so we're going to go ahead and just get rid of this we'll keep the default but I just wanted you to be aware of this attribute okay that's going to do it for this video in the next video we're actually going to create some labels for these one-line text box so we'll do that in the next video see you guys
