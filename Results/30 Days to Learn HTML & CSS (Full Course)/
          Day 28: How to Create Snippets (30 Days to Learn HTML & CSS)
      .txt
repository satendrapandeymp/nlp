in programs like textmate or sublime whatever you're using they generally have snippets built in so for example if I come here I have within my user I have created a set of CSS snippets now yours will likely have some built in generally I prefer to create my own and that's because I found when using somebody else's snippets you always forget the shortcut and you don't use them so if you create them yourself you force yourself to create a system and remember them in the process for example when creating CSS for my snippets I use the first letter of each word as the key if I want to float something to the left I use F L as the key word FL + tab and that expands it if I want to float it to the right F R tab if I need a width I can type W and that expands if I need a margin M but what if I need marchin on two sides only I do M - and that creates it and I can tab through these and it's much quicker it'll save you a massive amount of time if you're working with me in sublime and you want to create your own you can go to tools new snippet and right here don't let this confuse you all you need to do is specify your snippet so if I want a hello world snippet I can type hello world and we'll leave this blank for now and now if you want a tab trigger I can press command forward slash in sublime to remove that or you can do it manually and I'm going to keep that - hello and we'll leave that like this for the time being next I'm going to save it and we're going to save it into our user as hello that's sublime - snippet that's important now if I want to use this snippet anywhere in this case I can type hello tab and that expands if we want to have some more flexibility I can go right here and change this to hello and what this is saying is this is the first tab stop right here but we're going to set a default of hello now when I type it again it will select this so I can override it if I need to if you want to have another tab stop and we'll say how are you doing and I'm going to instead of doing today I'm make that optional so I'm going to do the second tab stop will have a default of today now I will save it try it again hello and now you can see we have multiple tab stops so I can change that to what hit tab again and what are you doing tomorrow and it saves quite a bit of time so I highly recommend that you do some yourself if you wanted to do for example at the m4 that I showed you and for or m2 let's do one together and we'll do m2 we are going to change this to margin and the top and bottom will have a default of 0 and the left and right will have a default of 0 as well now we're going to make these tab stops so one will have a default of 0 and 2 will have a default of 0 as well then I can remove this for now because this is a sample I'm going to set a tab trigger of hello and then right here if you want to specify a source you can limit this tab trigger to only a specific type of file like CSS want to come back and now if I type hello which is a ridiculous shortcut but it works for our demo you can see it's not working and that's because we have specified a scope so I'm going to comment that out again one more time and now that's expanded 2 pixels 4 pixels and we're done so this is what I'm going to do for the rest of our lesson I highly recommend that you do the same
