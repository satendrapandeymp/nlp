hello guys welcome to my channel this is the 16th tutorial in this course and in this tutorial we'll be talking about relative linking and relative linking is linking from one section of a document to another section of the same document from within the document right and we use the anchor tag for relative linking as well and we have already seen an example of the anchor tag in the last tutorial and you know what I have here is you know text from Spain's Wikipedia page and I just copied all the text that was there on the page and I pasted that text in this text file and in this HTML document and all the text is between the opening pre tag here and the closing P tag I don't know you know I have to scroll down way below yeah so the closing pre tag is on line number 805 right so between the opening and closing pre tag I have all this text and you know I also have two anchor tags in this file and also a pair of heading tags so let me show you guys the heading tags first so I have you know my opening heading tag the h2 tag on line number fourteen here and you know the corresponding closing heading tag is on line number seventeen so you know this section is going to appear in bold and it's also going to have a greater font size and this is the content section right so I just want this to be highlighted on the web page and that's why I have this within the h2 tags and similarly there is another section you know in this page I'll show you guys where that is yeah so it's right here and you know this one again is between heading tags so I have another opening heading tag on line number 619 and I have the corresponding closing tag on line number 649 as you can see here so let me show you guys this you know page in Google Chrome so this is how it looks and as you can see the text at the top of the screen you know this is not bold and it's also smaller in size as compared to the contents section which is in bold and also has a greater font size and similarly if I would scroll down then you know the languages section is again see over here again this is in bold and it's also greater in size so the reason why I've highlighted the you know these sections is because what I want to do is I want to click on the languages item in the content section here and I want to be taken to the languages section in the document right so this is what happens you know I'm sure you guys have used Wikipedia so when you click on an item in the content section you know for a page in Wikipedia you are taken to you know that particular section in the page so over here if I would click on the languages link which is there in the content section then I'm taken to the languages section in the document right and I can read it and I can you know have other links to you know from within the content section to the other sections in document so now let's see how we achieve this using the HTML that we have in this document so I'll go first up to the content section and see what I have there and obviously I have used the anchor tag for creating the link now the href attribute this time takes the value hash language straight so instead of specifying a URL here since we are sort of you know redirecting the user to you know another section in the same document we don't have to mention the URL of this document you know here as a value to the href attribute I have used the pound symbol or the hash and then I have you know typed in languages and you could even type in your own name here as long as this text matches the text at the destination and we're going to check out how the anchor tag looks at the destination but you know I have just typed languages here right and that's why this item six point five space languages appears as a hyperlink in in the webpage when you see it in a browser and now I would scroll down and show you guys how the destination anchor tag looks so I would scroll down to the languages section yeah here it is so over here again I have the anchor tag and between the lesson and greater than symbol I have a space name so this time I don't have the extra factor Butte here I have the name attribute and it takes the value languages so over at the top if you would have given the name you know let's say Spain underscore languages instead of just languages and you would have had to use the same name here right so you would have had to type Spain underscore languages here too but since we use languages or rather hash languages in the upper anchor tag we have to use languages here and again you know this is the place where you will be redirected if you click on the link that's made you know through the anchor tag in the content section and again you have the closing anchor tag so you know this is what relative linking is and it's very useful particularly in such documents in which there is lot of text and people have to scroll down and you know let's say there are like in this document there are eight hundred and seven lines of text so you know for even bigger documents documents that have thousands and thousands of lines if someone's interested on in only one particular section then it would make sense to create links at the top so that people can click on you know a link of their choice and be taken directly do whatever they wish to read right so that's it for now I'll see you guys in the next tutorial in which we'll check out more HTML and I hope you guys are enjoying this course and you may subscribe to my channel if you haven't ready see you in the next tutorial till then take care
