Wow your people I'm sure from the net ninja and this is HTML basics lesson 5 the head in the body so in the last lesson what did we do we started our first HTML web page and it was pretty simple to be fair but we've got the head in there and we got the body in there so in this lesson I just want to kind of hone in on those two tags make sure you completely understand them before we start to put out this website even more so just to recap quickly mm-hmm in the last lesson we said that the head side contains all the extra information about our web page so this can be things like metadata CSS references jasmit references so while this is data that you want to tell the browser lock this is some extra information about the web page but you don't want to show it to the user all that in the head the body tag contains all the visual content everything that you want to show to the user you put in the body tag headings images paragraphs whatever else you've got so I'm gonna jump back over to brackets now and I'll see you there and Here I am back in brackets and we're pretty much where we left off last time we've got our HTML tag head tag and body tag and we're going to start with the head now last time we popped in this meta character set utf-8 tag and I briefly said that this was basically telling the browser hey we're using the utf-8 character encoding for this website and not in AB set at the time that's what you're going to be using in probably even more unless you're going to be making a website for a Russian person you know something with Russian characters in or Japanese characters or something like that you're going to use utf-8 so that's going to be one of those things that you just put in head every time the next thing we did was the title tag and I've decided we're gonna sell fish online so I'm gonna change this to mr. greens fish Emporium alright in fact we'll call it mr. greens medication for him why not okay so the meta tags now I said last lesson or maybe one before that that there's various different types of meta tags we can use a few of them to tell the browser and crawlers crawlers are things that come from search engines to see what our website's about we can use them to tell those different things about the website make associations with it one such thing is the keywords meta tag now the keywords meta tag ain't used as much these days as it was in the olden times what it used to do was provide kind of keywords for Google or other search engines to use so that if you search for these keywords it your website might show up in results for them now it's not used as much these days people used to abuse them used to stuff loads of different keywords in there so they drank kindly for different terms Google and other search engines cotton Don and it's not as important anymore but it's still nice to make that Association and it can't hurt certainly so we'll do it in this example and this is just a meta tag we give it the attribute name remember these are all attributes these little things that we're giving it and the name is going to be keywords and we put the keywords himself in the content attribute and we'll say fish smell it whisper something smelly fish trout salmon why not mr. shark okay so there's our meta keywords tag will do another meta tag and this is going to be a description one it's called the description meta tag and like the keywords on this is you pie search engines if you search for a term in Google you'll see sometimes a lot of the links come up and then little descriptions underneath them little text nip it's this a lot of the time is where they come from so you want to give a good brief description of your website something that's going to attract users to click the link so we'll say we sell the smelliest fish online guaranteed who the hell is not gonna want to come to this website so we've got our meta tags now and we've got our title tag so what's next we'll do our CSS link now I'm not going to go into too much detail about this all you need to know for now is that we put our CSS links or references in the head that's where we tell the browser where our CSS file is located and when the browser sees this CSS reference is going to say right I'll go to the location this user or this developer has specified I'll get this CSS file and I'll use this to style the web page so just remember that much for now you don't have to remember too much about it so this is a link tag and we do link rel which stands for relationships on to the relationship of this link tag to the document is a stylesheet and type another attribute well it's going to be text slash CSS and that's just the type of the document and then we do our H reference and hate's ref by the way it stands for Hyper reference I think quote me if I'm wrong and that's just referring to the location of the CSS file so where is the CSS file stored now I'm going to make a folder called CSS and then I'll do a file called name dot CSS and we're now going to make this main CSS file now in a future course what I'll do is take this finished website that we do on this course and create a CSS file this is just to illustrate to you how we pop a CSS link or reference in the head and that's all there is to it so the browser's seen this it's saying ok so we've got a link tag here the relationship to this HTML document is a style sheet so I know it's a style sheet it's have typed text and CSS and this is its location so I can go out and find that now and I will apply all those Styles in that main dot CSS to this document ok so that's pretty much about your your head tag we can also pour script with references in there JavaScript but we're going to do that in a later course similar to this I mean it's a different type of tag is a script tag but it's a similar kind of method of referring to a location so your head tag contains all the extra information you want to say to a browser look this is what the web page is about here's some extra bits and bobs doesn't show anything to the to the user now and the body the body tag is everything you want to show to the user all right and you can put any tag that you want to in here to be honest we don't really need to put any other tags in here I mean I've already demonstrated that we can put a heading tag in we can put a P tag in and we're going to kind of flesh this out as we go along so that's all there is to know to be honest anything you want to show the user images text whatever you put in the body tag this is going to be the visual aspect of our website all right so that's pretty much it just a quick overview again of the head and the body in the next lesson we're gonna start to flesh out the body even more and actually build on creating our website I'll see you guys in
