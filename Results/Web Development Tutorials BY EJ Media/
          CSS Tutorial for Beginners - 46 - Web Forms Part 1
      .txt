over the next couple of videos we are going to take a look at web forms web forms are a Titanic subject so we will take our time on these and carefully examine this subject now pretty much everyone at one time or another has used a web form web forms allow us to enter information into the website it might be a checklist it might be a message board it could be customer feedback now over the next several videos we are going to cover the HTML side of web forms and then after that we are going to cover the CSS aspect to styling these web forms now of course everything in HTML is about elements and forms are no different at their basic level they are just elements and so that is where we will get started so the first element we need to create is the form element and that will contain all of our input fields that we're about to create so it all starts with the form tank now you'll notice these two attributes right here the action attribute and the method attribute we are not going to worry about these in this CSS series this is for another series especially ASP PHP and JavaScript and that is because this form gets submitted eventually to a web server and that server will handle all the data that the user inputted into the fields that we created so again this is for another lecture we don't have to worry about these because this is the design phase of our web form so now that we have the form tag that by itself doesn't do a lot we now need to create our HTML input elements and that is going to be where our user can input whatever information we want from them so let's first start out with a simple text box that's what we're gonna start out with and so I'll copy and paste what I created and then I'll explain it so we're going to embed our first input elements inside ap element tag and so here is the first one so I've created a label here which is just normal text and we're gonna call that name and here is where we specify our input element and you'll notice it's just called input this is the key right here we have to specify what input element this is and it's going to be text that stands for next box now this name attribute right here this is another attribute I don't want you to worry about this has to do again with the server that's going to be processing whatever data is submitted so we'll talk about this in a future series so don't worry about that for now now a input element is actually a inline element which means we need to put a break here because if we don't all these other input elements will be side by side by side and as we know that's what inline elements do so we have to put a break here so that these move in a top-down order now we could convert this to a black but that's not really the standard practice to do with input elements we're just going to use the break tag and so we're going to use a text box also for the address now as you'll see in a minute when we take a look at this in the browser the text box is just a single line and we use that because we only need a single line for the name address phone and email that's all we really need now if we want multiple lines we create a text area that's the element tag and we'll be doing that in a couple of videos that's for multi-line text though but in these four fields all we need is one line of text now you'll see here this input type of tell and that stands for telephone which is for our phone label and then the same thing for email we have a type of email these two used to be just normal text boxes but with html5 they have created several new types and one of those is for a telephone and one of those is for an email but if you put text in here actually they would work just the same are some subtle differences with this new type and I'll explain those in a future video so we've got our four input fields now where we can have our website user enter their name their address their phone and their email and remember again this is just the label and then this is the element so the label is actually outside of this and you'll see how this works when I fire up the browser and you know what this is going to be a form we're gonna be working on over the next several videos we're gonna design an entire form here so let's actually put a heading in here and we'll just use an h2 and we'll just use this following text fill out the information and hit the submit button below looks pretty good alright okay and there we go and you know what before we do that let's actually add another line break here so we'll get a little bit more spacing between our input fields now will control this a little bit more in CSS the space between these input fields but for now we'll just use line breaks okay so let's take a look and see what this looks like now and there we go we've got our four input text boxes now as you can see it's just a single row which is what we wanted so this is a good start now in the next video we're gonna add a select box as well as a check box and we're going to do that right in this area so we're gonna have our customer fill out some more information and so we'll take care of that in the next video see you guys then
