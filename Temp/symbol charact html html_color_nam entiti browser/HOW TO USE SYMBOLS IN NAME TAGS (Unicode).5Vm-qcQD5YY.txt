hello guys its Boyle from you know so I got this knife today from a site and I saw the name and I was like what a fuck did I haven't really seen a nametag like this before you know with a Chinese I'm guessing it is letters so I searched around a bit and it seemed like it's actually pretty pretty easy to do so my skillet did a similar video before but he didn't include Unicode the characters he only included you know the vote past the hostage and the vote failed ones and some other cool ones which is a really nice video but I started thinking like what if you can do other things with the Unicode so I saw a reddit post actually posted six months ago by a guy called the only Luke thank you so much for posting this but in six months I don't really think it's gotten that much attention I posted a picture on Twitter and almost no one knew about this how you name them like unicode characters also think because I'm from Sweden we have three special characters in the Swedish alphabet we have au and Earth and these of course aren't available just a name you can see I can write well uh and you see the name you've chose the name you choose is not a valid try another one so it doesn't work same if you come from Russia and used acrylic alphabet you might want to try something like Billy apt naming your knife ballet up that would be pretty cool but that doesn't work either so uh hmm how do we fix this now there are actually quite a lot of different unicode convert their sites but this is the easiest that i've found and it's called p me gene info and it's a really nice so what you do is you just copy paste or write the letter or the code that you want to convert and then click convert and you see you get this a large text which is just like the unicode number for the characters now what you do is you go into CS and copy paste all of these numbers but as you can see it's too long it doesn't fit it only produces beliya now of course there are exceptions like with a dollar code it's only two numbers it's 36 so of course you could paste this more than three times actually four times but this is the most I've found you could use a character it's four times now if you live in a country that uses different characters then the English alphabet this is of course very useful because you can name your your knives and your skins things you couldn't before like if I use 214 and then an L it produces this word which means beer in Swedish L nice or if I'd want to write something like this it produces the word fit quick which means cunt beard ah notice nice you can also name your knife this which makes it gay now with this you can also combine some pretty cool Smiley's like this one ah now like with the m9 mobile you saw that I had in my inventory you can even use Chinese letters like this this reads chin jaw which means sexual intercourse nice now if you're feeling extra adventurous you could just randomize the numbers so let's say I would learn to use a 21 325 maybe no my god yeah I don't know why why this is in the game like you can actually name your your weapon a swastika I think that's going to be pretty abused but I know maybe that's not as fast together that's a Buddhist symbol no dude everyone thinks that this is a swastika don't don't start shit bro now I know this can be abused with a swastika and other symbols but I think like since I'm Swedish I really want to use wha in the name tags that I put on my weapons because you know if I want to create a Swedish word and then I realized oh no it's got that it's got one of those symbols in it I can't use it that that is sad I searched for some custom remade weapons that I've found a few that are like pretty horrible but yeah hopefully you guys won't abuse it because it's actually very useful and I hope they don't remove it because it's act you know it's it's useful but yeah yeah some of these are pretty pretty bad pretty bad now something I realized after renaming my knife Hui it actually didn't get the last letter because the last letter didn't have the semi colon semi thing you know so I guess you can only use two maybe in some cases fuck you could just also be very generic and name your knife three dollar signs because you know fucking pimping now in-game it might not actually look that cool because as you can see in the bottom right corner it shows three dollar signs but when you inspect the weapon it doesn't show three dollar signs it just shows the code that you input to get those three dollar signs don't worry the people inspecting you in-game can actually see the three dollar signs in the bottom but of course they can't see it on the nametag itself Greek letters also work so it's really cool to name your knife maybe Omega Delta Alpha something like that and use the the symbol for the first letter nice this has been around for a long time actually but it's just that not many people seem to know about it so I thought I might as well make a video on it because I think this has a lot of use it's really cool I'll definitely be using it for Swedish name the name tag so I can use or and it's just it's just fucking cool dude it's just like small things you find the find in the game nice hey you banned me for yeah so like I said the last video Drake Moon is hosting a dragon or giveaway through me which is pretty cool and you can use my code on their sites if you want to it's uh normally but remember if you win something cool you will have to deposit one dollar in order to withdraw it nice
