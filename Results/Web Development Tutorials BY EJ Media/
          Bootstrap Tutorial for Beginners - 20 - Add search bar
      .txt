so in the last several videos we have created this navigation bar and we've added several things to it we've added a button we've added a brand and in this video we're going to go ahead and add a search bar so let's go ahead and we'll put it right after our button so we want to put it right after this ul and as you know in HTML in order to create a form we need to use the form element so let's go ahead and do that and then we're gonna call a bootstrap class you might have guessed that by now now the major class that you're going to call is navbar - form this is the first class that you will call when you are creating your bootstrap form so this always comes first in your form element okay so let's go ahead and close this out and now we need to go ahead and create a div and we're gonna call another bootstrap class and this one is going to be called form group actually there's a hyphen there so form - group so these are the first two classes you will call now the form group class basically is the class that you will add to your first div and remember forms basically have two main things that you will add one is an input field which we're about to do in a minute and the other is a button so we're gonna add both of those and these are gonna go inside of our dip so basically the form group will handle whatever elements we add to our form in this case again it will be an input element and a button element so let's go ahead and close out this div forgot to do that and we can just copy and paste this one down here I always like to take shortcuts now let's go ahead and add our input field and you will remember that we use the input element and let's set the type to text because we want this to be a text box that we can enter something into now for our input field we need to add another bootstrap class here and this basically will handle the input field that we're creating so the class that we need to call is called form control that is the one we call and I forgot an equal sign here that would help now you'll remember if you took my HTML tutorial series and I hope you did you'll remember that we can add some default text into our field and we use the placeholder attribute to do that so let's go ahead and do that and let's just go ahead and put in the word search so this will indicate to the user that they can search for something in this field and then let's go ahead and close this out good now we have our input field and it's all contained in a nice diff now what we want to do is go ahead and add our button but we want this outside the div because this is actually gonna be separate and so let's go ahead and create a button using the button element and we're gonna go ahead and set the type to submit and you'll remember bootstrap provides button classes so let's go ahead and call one of those button classes and of course you will remember that the default class is just BTN so let's call that and you'll remember we have several different styles that we can call and let's call the danger style I think that will look pretty good on our navbar and then let's provide some text for our button we're just gonna call this a submit button which is what it is of course and let's go ahead and close out our button alrighty I think this is all the code we need and so let's go ahead and save this and we'll fire this up in chrome as usual and let's see how this looks and take a look at that we got our search bar and it's right to the right of our buttons which is where we wanted it now what if you wanted to pin this to the right well bootstrap provides a really good class to do that so let's go back to our code and we want to actually control this in the very beginning so you go up here and you can call the navbar class again and the option you can use this time is right and basically this will just float all of our elements that are inside of here to the right so this is kind of like a float think of it like that now this has a couple other options too you can actually float left if you want so you could do nav bar - left or you could do nav bar - Center so it has a couple different options but we want to go ahead and pin our search bar to the right and you know what I noticed I forgot to close the form tag and actually the reason it worked the last time we loaded this is because the browser is smart enough to figure it out so really nothing was affected but let's go ahead and just be clean here and let's go ahead and just close this out okay so let's go ahead and save this and let's load this back up in our browser and take a look at that the search bar is now on the right and let's actually go ahead and minimize this to make sure this is mobile-friendly and it is that looks just great okay I will see you guys in the next video thank you
