hello friends welcome to HTML video tutorial series in the previous video tutorial we have discussed typical structure of html5 document in this tutorial I am going to discuss HTML comment so let's get started I go to start type here notepad I click on notepad then I write typical structure of html5 document let's get started first I write doctype HTML then we know that HTML document is going to be begin by opening HTML tag and end by closing his tml tag in the HTML tag we use a languor attribute and we give the value en to indicate this HTML document language is English and then every HTML document is different of two sections one is the head and another one is the body closing body and in the head section I am going to write meta MDTA meta Care set is equal to utf-8 close then I set title HTML comments demo closing title then I save this file file save as default dot HTML both sides I put double quotation and save the file at desktop IRA click this open with the Firefox you can see that the file got open now what are HTML comments HTML comments are available from the beginning we find HTML comments in HTML 4 also in HTML 5 also in the previous version of htmls also we find HTML comments now comments are used by designers or developers to explain HTML codes they are used to add more readability and understandability to the core one of the most important point you need to remember is comments are ignored by the browser's comments are not executed by the browser's comments are ignored comments are used to give descriptions to the core that's it let's see a demonstration to write a comment we write less than then we write exclamation mark - - that indicates the beginning of the kurma comment and then to end a comment we write - - greater than sign that indicates end of the comment in between anything we write is going to be ignored by the browser for example this text is ignored if I say file save go to browser and refresh you can see that the text is not getting display because this text we have enclosed in between opening comment and ending comment symbols quite simple right if I do not write this text in between the comment symbol file save go to browser and refresh you can see that it is getting displayed this text is ignored so anything you do not want the browser to execute you can comment it by using less than exclamation mark - - to indicate the beginning and to end we write that - greater than sign file save code browser and refresh that content is ignored anything we have written in between the comment symbols are ignored by the browsers as I told comments are used to describe HTML code just to give explanation to the core I can say here less than - exclamation mark - - beginning of body section - - greater than sign and here I write less than exclamation mark - - end off body section - - so this is just an explanation I have given here so that some other person can understand what actually the body tag are closing body tag indicates file save go to browser and refresh you can see that there is no problem you can write description about the code as many lines of code you want exclamation mark - - and here I say author author is mr. ma and Ju na th montuno children and then date on which I am writing this is 9 bar n bar 16 then - - this is just an explanation about the document who has written you can write comments anywhere you want ctrl X I can put it above the HTML also here file save could a browser and refresh and see there is no problem but remember that do not put comments about the doctype always doctype should be the first line in html5 document remember that I hope you guys are understanding what are comments comments are ignored by the browsers they are used to give explanation about the code so that other person can understand or maybe I can be able to understand if I come back to this code after few months this is how we write single line comments this is how we write multiple line comments for this tutorial this much is enough friends in the next tutorial we get more info for more benefits and be upgraded please subscribe to my youtube channel and don't forget to like comment and share these videos with others so that everyone should get benefited keep learning keep coding keep sharing thank you guys thank you very much see you in the next tutorial
